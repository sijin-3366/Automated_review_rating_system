4.0,"I am 5'0 flat, 130lbs and I ordered my normal size, which is usually medium, (I do have a little more in the back so if you're my size with a smaller booty a small would be good, as the material is stretchy so it may not fit right). I do however, have small boobs, (36B) so it does fit a little looser than I'd like it to in the top. Other than that, it arrives pretty quickly and does look exactly like the picture, (I ordered the green and yellow palm tree beachy looking one."
4.0,The socks are very comfortable
4.0,"This swimsuit is really cute. I love the style of the top, which is flattering but not overly revealing. The only problem with the bikini, though, is that it is definitely at least one size smaller than I expected. I usually fit easily into a size Small, but this one felt like and Extra Small, if not Extra Extra Small."
4.0,Nice for the feet. But be still!!
4.0,Love the fit- purchased as a post partum top and it‚Äôs fitted in the right spots and drapes around the belly. My only complaint is the quality. The top arrived with threads already coming out in multiple places. I‚Äôve purchased from this brand before and expected better quality.
4.0,I ordered this product for my office purpose to carry my laptop. It serves the purpose  I have ordered for and has various section.
4.0,I‚Äôve ordered 11 dry fit shirts in the last 30 days from Amazon and I‚Äôve gotten what I ordered as for sizes go but I received xxl on this particular order when I had requested xl making me not vary happy with Neleus in this regard. As for quality of the shirts I‚Äôve received they are awesome and I‚Äôve already recommended them to my coworkers and friends.
4.0,Cute and sassy colors.  small easy too store.
4.0,"Cute, but the hinges on the earpieces are kinda loose."
4.0,Mi bebe los ama<br />Pierden un poco de color muy r√°pido
4.0,Package was envelope that flattened the ears.<br />Gotta figure how to get them up like suppose to be. Rest of hat great
4.0,The shoes fit as expected I don't know how I warm when I was in my teens
4.0,"I wanted this skirt for what I knew it would be: satiny, flowing, long, and in a burgundy color. In those respects, it was just what I wanted, so I'm pretty much happy with the purchase (about 1/3 of the price of what I would pay for a similar item at a mall store). It fits tighter at the stomach, and I kind of expected it to, so I'm not really disappointed with that either - I was just hoping it would defy my expectations. I can wear a longer top or sweater until I lose enough of the weight for it to fit properly there as well. Like I said, for what I paid and expected, it was a good deal."
4.0,"had a chemical scent the first few days. Still, it looks nice and it's pretty durable"
4.0,Overall this was a great fit/product... it's not supportive enough for me to actually use as a sports bra (other than maybe on the elliptical- certainly not enough for my Zumba or Step class! lol)- but it's comfortable. The straps are stretchy- and there is no lining. It's double layered- but no padding. It fit true to size- I'm a 36D and that is what I ordered. Took the risk on the right fit- as bras/sports bra's can vary. But knowing it was a bit stretchy helped. I'm a Maidenform 36D though- not a Victoria Secret. They do fit much differently. This fits more like a generic bra brand (which is typically smaller than victoria secret bras).
4.0,"4 stars because of issues I had with the bracelets BUT NinaQueen customer service is AWESOME, I had a pleasure to be contacted by Jocelyn and she solved all my issues with their product and not only that! Simply, she made me happy after all :-) Go for it!"
4.0,"My daughter loves the dress. The material is thin, but not see through. It has a cool feel to it, almost silk like. We love it!"
4.0,"Not a bad strap for the price, but the finish does reflect the price."
4.0,Varying sizes that make it useful for both bracelets and necklaces.
4.0,"Lovely dress. Just disappointed with the slip, it tends stretch as you move around"
4.0,"These glasses have the most wonderful lenses, however, they are so large that they do not look good on my female face.  I will attempt to give them to some guy who can truly appreciate how great the view is thru these lenses.  Hopefully I can find a pair more in a woman's style to enjoy the view."
4.0,"Only issue is the band retainers do not stay in place. Even with two of them, the band will still come out."
4.0,"I'm a person that needs comfort,  and that includes keeping my neck warm with the right material.<br /> I cannot wear infinity scarves (too long, too many loops), safety requirements at work say nothing can be dangling,  and my personal comfort does NOT include gaiters (too tight and difficult to put on and pull off).<br /><br />This fits the bill!<br />Soft.<br />The right amount of stretch and looseness.<br />And is washable.<br /><br />  I've not washed/worn yet.  But trying these on are yummy comfortable.<br /><br />They are thin,  but the softness and ability to double layer (fold in half) kept me warm.<br /><br />Will update after washing and wearing.<br /><br />*its cold at work at times,  and I need to keep my neck warm.  In my normal day to day,  I pull up to warm my ears and cover my head.  These have enough stretch to do that."
4.0,"Like others have stated, it is a very well made strap for the price. Length will vary on the size of watch you put this on. I found it to be a typical length. Keep in mind, this will stretch as it breaks in. This is by far stiffer than any canvas strap I have purchased in the past, but its comfortable.<br />I read somewhere, if you put the strap in a pocket of a pair of jeans your going to throw in the wash, it will soften the strap up pretty fast. Gonna try it this weekend. This isn't a true Zulu.  A Zulu is a one piece strap you just slide through the spring bars. This is just a canvas strap that mocks a Zulu ."
4.0,"These shirts fit well and serve the purpose I bought them for, which is pajama shirts for my daughter. I thought they could also serve as undershirts that could peak through above lower neck shirts & dresses, but they won't work for that. The material is too thin and the colored trim line at the neck interferes with that as well."
4.0,It‚Äôs a good very valuable and powerful piece
4.0,"if you want a thick cozy hooded long robe with nic animal print this is it. i am 5 10"" 162 lbs.  the arms are short but look ok rolled up.for me it is more oractical if you want to walk around and do dishes and light housekeeping. if you want them long this is not for you."
4.0,Do the job at a reasonable price. Construction is ok even though the hinges are squicky. Wished the lenses were darker too.
4.0,"Very cute, I want to buy more for some friends. Giving 4 stars since it was a bit longer than I'd like for my wrist size, but I am very satisfied with this nicely priced little piece."
4.0,Rodeo style!
4.0,Great visibility for work üëç
4.0,The overall back length of these shirts are not as long as my other order and a bit different within the enclosed 3 shirts. Quality control need to be better.
4.0,"I purchased these to coordinate with a pendant. They're a darker hue than I expected, and beautiful. They really sparkle. I docked one star cause I find the screw backs difficult to use. I prefer friction posts and backs."
4.0,Just what I wanted. A solid leather belt. But I ordered a size smaller figuring that my 2&#34; buckle would make up the difference but apparently they already calculate that in.I can barely get my buckle into the 1st hole. Make sure that you order your size.
4.0,"Would've given the top 5 stars if the shoulders didn't rise up a bit. That's just my being picky though. Otherwise it's cute, fits well, and most importantly the lace isn't stiff and thick. It's actually soft against your skin and soft to the touch. You can dress it up or go casual."
4.0,Beautiful tiara but it is narrow so it's challenging to keep on my daughter's 4 year old head.
4.0,"Real leather, beautiful color and design. Holds tons of stuff. Amazing price! I had to spend $10 to fix the strap because the piece of leather that holds it in place was too big."
4.0,There ok for the price.
4.0,"Very cute ,but the top it's very tide,especially around your arms,I ordered M,originally I am S and it's still tide:("
4.0,Nice tunic.
4.0,Great shoes. Only issue I have is that the lining on the inside irritates a little bit without socks.
4.0,"I like the style of this bracelet, but the way it looks on, it's so cute! It's goes with a lot of different outfits, and the price made me very happy."
4.0,They don‚Äôt really look like sharks but keep my son‚Äôs feet warm
4.0,Love the top but the skirt is way to big
4.0,not the best quality but its cute and works fine
4.0,He loves this shirt.  Need more items for the old intruders.
4.0,"Pretty,  very lightweight,  great for summer or hot weather.  I hand washed because I thought it might be too fragile.  Very wrinkled after wash - all cotton.  Looks like a skirt, fits high waisted."
4.0,"generally good quality, sizing in general seemed ok for the waist, however too long on the leg--i personally don't like my compression shorts to be super long but if you don't mind it, order your normal size,  if not, order a size down."
4.0,Very comfortable.  I like it!
4.0,"Was a gift, very cute and she loved it."
4.0,"Great shirt.  Nice thick material, will last.  The graphic was perfect and the color was exactly as shown.  My 9 year old loves it."
4.0,"Only problem was the way it stored , disappointed with rolled up tight in plastic back for?"
4.0,These MAFNSB are very attractive and are extremely lite and airy which I love. However they are marginally on the small size for a man with a bubble buttocks.
4.0,"Dress arrived in about two weeks. The color is like a dark wine, fabric is not sheer, not scratchy either but for $12.00 not the best haha. Based on the measurements guide I purchased the large. I usually wear a size 6 in jeans, small in tops. The cleaveage is real in this dress, maybe a bit too real for me, I have a padded sports bra and tank top underneath so it's hard to tell but when I don't wear anything the girls are bound to spill out haha.<br /><br />Here's what I really just don't like: the cut and style on the bottom is unflattering. The stock picture makes it look like a flowy bottom, but if you check my picture on the right, you'll see one layer stops around upper thigh,  then there are like two sewn on flaps front and back that gives an illusion that it's flowy. From the side it looks not cute. From the front not so bad. Butttttt, hello I bought this dress for near to nothing, so my expectations weren't high to begin with. It really is like a forever 21 dress, might last if you don't wash or wear too much might not. But it's cute and cheap so this will work for the event I plan to wear it to."
4.0,"Nice quality. I sized up to a medium (usually a small or medium), thinking it would be a bit loose, but was unable to get the zipper all the way up."
4.0,Thought it would be rather larger  travel bag yet it's darker than color pictured however instead of for myself I made use for it as a gift thank you kindly for your service and effort especially delivery came fast
4.0,Fits great and feels great. Love the fabric.
4.0,I haven't used it for travel yet but it doesn't fit a folded A4 size paper.
4.0,Just what I wanted. Fits my bulky phone perfectly. I just wish it had the billfold like my smaller Vera wallet did. Otherwise it is great.
4.0,"the more imaginitive you are, the better this will be. but be very careful with it....it will break rather easily."
4.0,"es muy peque√±a. pense que seria mas grande, es como un crossbody bag."
4.0,"Love the color‚Äîit‚Äôs just as shown. Although it had a lot of stretch, it didn‚Äôt stretch to fit my (lack of) curves :). From the front I love the look. Unfortunately, the back scrunches up and creates a lump in the zip area.  Pulling down the dress doesn‚Äôt fully get rid of the bump. Besides, over time the dress just naturally rides up a little and the lump just gets more prominent.  I think if I were taller (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 4‚Äù , weigh 113 pounds, a 32 B, and am wearing a small) or had a longer torso, this dress would lay properly. I love the dress, but the feeling isn‚Äôt mutual‚Äîsadly, I‚Äôll be returning it."
4.0,I like them. The butterfly could have been a little bigger but cute in my 2nd ear hole.
4.0,"They ran small, but otherwise quality and comfort was fantastic. :D Can't wait to get the replacement pair in the larger size."
4.0,"I was looking for a romantic/whimsy Top, but I Felt this looked a bit peasant-y on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 128lbs. It‚Äôs a good length and nice color. The buttons are my favorite part! The top is well-made, not see through. I like it enough and can style it to suit me, but wouldn‚Äôt reorder"
4.0,not what i expected buh they nice
4.0,Dress looks just like the photo. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and a size 6. The medium was just right. The color is more of a seafoam green. Not emerald green.
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The material is thicker, so it‚Äôs not very see-through, even though it‚Äôs light colored. I felt that the top could have been better constructed and the straps are so thin that they are dangerous. I will be replacing them with something a little stronger so that I feel like I can wear the dress without being at risk of a strap busting."
4.0,"really great product for the price! there was a little issue since there's no strong elastic around the waist, so it falls down easily, but the color & length are spot on!"
4.0,The watch was nice but way too small for a man. Had to give it to my wife and it fit her perfectly.
4.0,It was smooth and worthy to buy.
4.0,Wish it came in a smaller size than 6. Great ring for the price. Fast delivery. Cheap enough I was able to get each family member in our little group ... to give us all something alike to commemorate our first (of many I hope) girls trip.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />Gave the rings to the ladies in my group...everyone loved them...something special to tie all our fantastic memories together...
4.0,"I gave 2 to my sister and her 10 year old daughter for Christmas. They loved them. Very pretty and nice look about them. They were a little darker silver color than I expected for stainless, but they still looked good."
4.0,Larger than I thought it would be but holding up well so far.
4.0,It‚Äôs not dark silver like pictured. Also the clasp on the band keeps coming loose since receiving it 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôm not thrilled with the purchase for the price. Update: I contacted Amazon to replace/exchange the watch due to the band being defective and I received the replacement quickly. So far the new band and Watch seem fine. The watch although not what I expected is very pretty and seems well made besides the initial defective band which was my reason for giving ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful and the pearls are round, symmetrical, and luminescent - everything you would expect from quality pearls.  I ordered the pink pearls, and the color was not what I expected.  They are dark and almost lavender in color which is why I did not rate with 5 stars."
4.0,Overall love the short but... dang the chest is small considering I got an xl and I normally would get a medium in tops.
4.0,"These are nice maxi dresses. Very comfortable, fabric nice and soft. Colors are nice. Added plus, they have pockets. Love these dresses."
4.0,Very cute but be gentle with it.
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 160 lbs and a 34C/32D. I ordered a small and it fits great! In typical bridesmaid dresses my hips are a 12, waist is a 10, and bust is an 8. Because of the fit of this dress I ordered a small, in attempt to fit by bust correctly. The waist elastic and flowy bottom were flattering on the lower half of my body. The only reason i deducted a star is because the advertised picture shows the same patter/color on the underside of the high-low. As you see in my picture, the underside is white. It'll still be perfect for bridal/baby showers, which is what I bought this dress for."
4.0,"(Ordered on my boyfriends account)<br /><br />So far so good.<br />I ordered my normal size, meduim (36C), and they fit perfectly. Im 6 months pregnant, but im sure they will still fit as i get bigger and start nursing. Although I know with my first son I was falling out of a double the first few months of nursing, so the medium may be a little snug but I'm sure it'll still work.<br />I needed something light weight and comfy to sleep in, as going bra-less at night was starting to hurt, i needed a little support. They are also really nice to wear around the house instead of a bra.<br />I took out the hideous padding. The padding was oddly shaped (like a round bowl) and not needed. I have other, triangle contoured padding from swimming tops that i can add if i need to.<br /><br />I definitely reccommend these nursing bras. With my first son, i remember paying 50+ dollars for just one bursing sports bra. You cant beat the price here and they are really comfortable. The clasps to open bra for nursing are easy and can be done with just one hand. With a little practice, im sure it can be closed with just one hand as well. Making life easier with a little one in tow.<br />Im happy with purchase :)"
4.0,arm holes were a bit tight.  A slight snip of the seam took care of it. Worth the time to do that.
4.0,My fianc√© was happy with his gift. Strongly recommend this item üëçüèΩ
4.0,Comfortable shoes and I walked miles in them.  They are difficult to slip on and off due to the form fitting nature of the shoes.
4.0,Don't think they're worth the price...Fit tight around my big toe knuckle when I adjust strap it's to lose.<br />But they look great.(Black&Grey)
4.0,Great jeans...just the right amount of streatch
4.0,"These pants look adorable on my daughter -- she typically wears a 6x and the 4-6x was slightly short in the seat area -- I was afraid sizing up would make the pants too big, but next time I am going with the larger size for her. The quality seems good, though she just wore them around the house for a bit, they stretch a ton and she says they are comfy. They have a tendency to show too much of her low back/butt region when she bends -- so I'm considering an exchange. The do look just like jeans with a tunic top...worth the $10 I paid."
4.0,"While very cute, this necklace is less impressive in person. It's suitable for a child or teen, but the quality isn't exactly what most adults would want to wear out in public."
4.0,"I bought thinking true to size but it was a bit large, very pretty lots of compliments. Nice material, well made and hey, it's black so it's sexy too!"
4.0,These came on time packaged well. The fabric is a bit thinner than expected but is nice because it is appropriate for the weather. I bought these for my children to wear as mask however they seem slightly to big so I tried it on and it was too big for me. We won't be able to wear them as a mask unless we tie it off in the back.
4.0,These are adorable.  They came in a cute little gift box. They are a little fancy for everyday wear but will look great for the next event I need to dress up for.
4.0,This is so comfy. It fits good and at the perfect length. The color is good and vibrant. Also I've had no problems after washing.
4.0,Shirt fits good and looks great!
4.0,Like them and will buy again
4.0,"It‚Äôs nice and cozy,pleasant material,fits a little weird though,no the same cut as the picture though"
4.0,The clogs are great for slipping on for the beach. Not sure about arch support. These are perfect for playtime . Great price
4.0,"Nice mask with double layer flannel plaid but most important to me, made in Michigan."
4.0,Beautiful ring but more for special occasions. The size is much larger than I was expecting.
4.0,Great weight
4.0,"I bought the jacket for my son, he is totally in love with it"
4.0,"The super cute pattern of the sweater. The material is polyester, and it does not look too polished. I wear it pretty often. However, I wish I went with a large to give it a little more an oversized look. I am usually wearing size US 6 and ordered a medium, and it looks a little tight."
4.0,Size up if possible
4.0,"It was a good material and fit well, but very thin."
4.0,"Larger than I expected, but small enough to fit in purse...I would recommend purchasing it."
4.0,Fits a little large but kept my phone and valuables together while jumping and moving in tight crowds
4.0,"These boots are so comfy! Make sure to order a size smaller than usual. The color is also very nice, the thing I do have an issue with is how easy they are to scuff! I had scuffs after the first time wearing them, and I still get them. I use  rubbing alcohol to get them off."
4.0,Good product we stitched 2 together and added pocket for additional filters
4.0,"Bought these for my wife and naturally the decision was fashion-first. They're cool and everything, just obviously lacking in terms of lens clarity and durability. Overall a decent deal if this is the style you're looking for."
4.0,Wear it with jeans. nice looking.
4.0,"Good to go, fits just right"
4.0,Comfortable beautiful piece with gold buttons on sleeve. I just love the finish on a ralph lauren piece.
4.0,Very pretty. Good quality. It seems to run a little big. I usually wear a medium but would need a small in this dress.
4.0,"When I first  but this on my body, it looked like a tent. There is some excess fabric in the breast/underarm area. I threw a belt on my waist and it looked so much better! Its really cute but doesn't have shape. I suggest wearing it with a belt."
4.0,"Comfy, warm and supportive slipper for winter."
4.0,"I ordered the small, they were too small. Lol my bad."
4.0,Great looking boots but there is a slant in one of the soles so its not too comfortable. I was expecting better quality for the price and brand. I love acgs and have been very satisfied up until I bought these. Ill stick to the manoas from now on.
4.0,The dress was beautiful. The only thing I didnt like was the inside material. It was way too short. Had to adjust many times
4.0,"Nose clip uncomfortable.  Big nose. Glasses are great, from a vision standpoint."
4.0,"These pants are about half the thickness of regular sweatpants but are still appropriate for cooler weather.  I live in Florida, so I definitely think these would be too hot for summer wear, but in cooler states, these could be worn year round.  I got these for my boyfriend.  He us 5'7&quot; tall and he is fit.  He is of larger build, but not body builder big.  He usually wears a large in pants because he has muscular legs.  These might be a little snug in the waist area for anyone with a pooch in the belly.  These might also be too short for taller people.  I really do think that most men that normally wear a large should probably order up if you are going to order these.  The elastic at the bottom is nice because sweatpants often end up fitting my boyfriend long.  It also makes these a good option for him to run in when the colder months come.<br /><br />Overall, these are pretty good quality pants that also look nice. I think the fit runs slightly smal and that the length runs slightly short.  However, this worked out for my boyfriend and they fit him perfectly. He also says that they are very comfortable.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not required to give a positive review and my opinions are my own. Should my opinion change with further use, I will update this review to reflect that change in opinion"
4.0,This polishing cloth worked well for polishing a silver cup I had that was left to oxidize for more than 30 years.<br /><br />I didn't use anything but the cloth to remove the oxidation.There was some heavy oxidation on the inside of the cup that it was unable to  be removed so that is why I only gave this product 4 stars.<br /><br />I am going to to some more methods for getting the oxidation off but overall the polishing cloth works fairly well on silver.
4.0,"These are comfortable and lightweight sunglasses which also look very stylish! I cannot stand cheap looking these sunglasses, and was relived upon receiving these that they have a quality look and feel. The lenses themselves are fantastic. They don't sit as ""tight"" around my nose as I'd like them to, but that could be due to my face structure.<br /><br />I wear these sunglasses while driving and they really help to reduce glare and provide better visibility."
4.0,"I love the top! It‚Äôs very soft and pretty. The only reason I rated it as a 4, was it was a little long, and a little tight around the chest. I am 5‚Äô1 170 lbs for reference, and I ordered a large."
4.0,Beautiful suit. Should be sized as medium rather than extra large.
4.0,Loved the outfit. Got tons of compliments. It was a little off on the chest part but nothing a little duct tape couldn‚Äôt fix! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 160lbs. I got an XL based on the reviews saying size up and it fit perfect!
4.0,nice evening cover for summer.
4.0,"Very stretchy but fit well. Longer and slightly shinier than I expected. It's a nice, neutral khaki green color. Didn't work with my wardrobe but I could see it fitting in if you wear colors that go with this skirt color."
4.0,Very comfortable. Wear 1x-2x u.s. and the 4x fit good but I have a mommy tummy and I didn't like how it was quite obvious from the side.
4.0,Im lucky i order big for my children because it fit her perfectly. Order a size or two up...fits real small.
4.0,"Fit as expected ,very cute style even though the fabric quality  is less than expected but I still like it because I feel comfortable to wear it for many different  times like dinner,shopping,hang out with my friends. Highly recommended for curvy girls."
4.0,"Very worth the price,  We still use the keychain here in FL and the belt is nice."
4.0,This isn't exactly what I had anticipated. I wouldn't wear it as a necklace I have it hanging from my rear view mirror in the car and it looks cute.
4.0,"Nice, cute shirt but had to return as too long and big in general."
4.0,Love these! I have them in black as well
4.0,I just got this the other day as of right now it is amazing! I just wish it had some kind of display for time and date...
4.0,Nice thick material. I love the fit. I am 5' 2&#34; and 145 pounds. I wish I had a picture to upload but it is very casual and comfortable.
4.0,Cute top. It‚Äôs thicker than I thought it was going to be. This isn‚Äôt really a problem. I can wear it under sweaters in the fall and winter. Good material and quality so far. The only thing I can say as a negative is the underarms are cut a bit higher than I‚Äôm used to. Might pay to size up.
4.0,Cute but didn't arrive in a box
4.0,Better than I expected! Super cute.
4.0,Buy your regular size or one size down. The size chart shows the MAX size fit when fully stretched
4.0,I found the laces difficult to adjust comfortably.
4.0,"Great for the Xmas season. The straps were a bit big, easy to fix. Rather have it a bit big, than a bit small! Price was very well worth it."
4.0,Pinch handle is hard to press.
4.0,Very fashionable and nice silver color. Using it now for this cold weather. Very comfortable also!!! I can recommend this jacket
4.0,"I like these earrings because they remind me of Princess Diana.  The look of royalty is there and yet I can wear it with simple, everyday clothes.  It makes me feel elegant in my t-shirt and shorts."
4.0,Very cute dress however its cut small and has no elasticity!
4.0,Does the job keeping the collection neat and secure
4.0,"Its a beautiful skirt , but its NOT a women's size 16. Its a teens 16. Waist very small like for my granddaughter. Was for My ma to wear to a wedding this weekend. Won't fit. Bummer."
4.0,I was very excited for this dress but it didnt fit the correct way ..i knew if i wore this dress i was sure to have a nip slip! ...i think this is for women that are a little less endowed or with perkier twinsets than my own :) very cute dress just too low cut for me to wear properly!
4.0,Nice color. Strength seems good but u need a small size eyeglass handle to fit in the whole. I just bought a cheap pair snd works just right!
4.0,"Yeah, these cost a bit more than the ones you'd find at a flea market, but they're worth it. the metal clip is more durable than the plastic ones many clip-ons have, & the lenses are thick enough to last with reasonable care, yet thin enough that if you need to trim them to fit, a sturdy pair of scissors will do the job. I'm probably going to order another pair in the not-to-distant future."
4.0,They are cute just a little difficult to get on.
4.0,Good quality. I gave it 4 because chain is small and wished they had different sizes. Very well made.
4.0,"Great quality,  runs small"
4.0,"I went up in size due to a few reviews stating it ran a little small. i didn't think so. I should have stuck with my normal jacket size as it was too puffy in the back and oversized in the shoulders. Would have kept it if it fit since it was cute. 5'7'', 145lbs, 34DD"
4.0,Socks are good. Cost is high.
4.0,I ordered a medium and it fit small . I would definitely order a size up
4.0,"I have the previous &#34;version&#34; of this sweatshirt in a medium, and this sweatshirt in medium is much larger. The previous version is also 55% poly / 45% cotton, and this one is only 52% poly. It's comfy though, but looks/feels bulkier than I'd like."
4.0,I like the function of this a lot.  I wish it would hold more cash in the center.  Other than that I love it.
4.0,Needs to have more weight to them
4.0,"When this arrived, early, I was so happy that it looked even better than the picture! It's black with a circular neck, the bodice is a heavy warm material, cotton, and then from under the bust it flows out sheer with layered soft ruffles ending in an flowing barely ruffled edge It's not sewn on ruffles but falls from the sheer, taffeta like material like a ruffle. I wear it with my black tights, my sheer black nylons, and my jeans with boots and with the nylons, my Giovanni ballet flats. Definitely a dress up or dress down, either way you will be so comfortable and warm except the skirt of it really calls for heavy tights or jeans. Oh I also wear it with my Palazzo pants. It's just so versatile. I got an x-large but could have worn a large, so you will want to size down-a tighter fit would have been nice, but I don't like returns. Too much paper work. I left out a star because the arms are so long I had to roll them up a bit. And I'm 5&#34;9&#34; tall, long arms and legs. Beautiful, have worn it out with friends to the shows and wore it to a bonfire party on the beach. I got compliments at both events. I totally would recommend this to you, it makes you feel pretty and feminine."
4.0,It's perfect for weddings or a fancy party. I agree it was wrinkled but it cam in a bag so no big deal.
4.0,returned this item because it was too large for me. Color was very nice
4.0,Girlfriend loves it. Need to get her different colors soon.
4.0,Fits comfortably and is great for my line of work as well as going to the gym. The only think that I don't like is that you can't leave it on for too long because the skin underneath can't breathe as with a metal ring that isn't snug. Otherwise it's great.
4.0,Very breathable and my son just love the shark
4.0,"It's a little hard trying to get it on your wrist, I think if they had put a different clasp on the back of it it would have been easier but it looks absolutely adorable . And it's adjustable for small or big wrist"
4.0,"Nice smart fit. 180 pounds, 5'7&#34;"
4.0,"It is rather strong and sturdy. However, the blade is not quite sharp enough to be able to insert into the watch back to pry it open."
4.0,"I got the wine/ burgundy color. Form-fitting, but I expected more of a clingy, spandex fabric. Top is 97 poly, 3% elastine. Lacy neckline had a sloppy, ragged finish so I did trim it neatly. Too pretty to return, tho."
4.0,beautiful but length is longer than I expected
4.0,I think I should have bought a bigger size to hide my tummy. Rather than that I think it is quite pretty.
4.0,The chain that comes with this necklace is very delicate and small in length.  My mom loved it
4.0,Good shirt. Sizes run smaller. Kind of feminine cut.
4.0,I purchased an XL but could have probably fit a Large. Only wore it once to a themed birthday party but halloween is coming or perhaps another event where i can wear it. Price was perfect though even if i never get to wear it again.
4.0,A little on small side but can make it work.
4.0,Very nice product an kept my girs hands very warm in the snow/
4.0,"Great product, the rubber tips (for grip) at the ends are very resilient, in the four years I have been wearing my identical pair, it has not peeled or cracked or anything of the sort. It's better to buy this on amazon (you get the proof of purchase and everything) than in an actual eyeglass store because the last I bought this at an optical center where they sold glasses and made the lenses, the total came out to be 800 dollars (I KNOW). It wasn't the lenses that were expensive, but the frames itself.<br />This model in particular is great for people with wide faces, especially around the cheekbones. As well as those with round faces or have soft curved faces as this will bring more definition to your face with it's sharp angles.<br />It is preferable to have a nose bridge that's higher up when wearing these frames, because otherwise, the bottom of lens holder part will touch your cheeks (but you can buy little sticky gel pads that you stick on the nose rest to make the bridge a little higher up)<br />Now, one complaint I have with this is, it hurts like hell when you wear over the ear headphones, the legs of frames are wide and thick so it just really digs in even more when you have headphones that squeeze your head where your glasses are, to stay in place. Super uncomfortable and sometimes even painful after long hours.<br />It is adjustable (but not too much), so you have to be very careful, I suggest running it under hot water to soften the material up a bit, and then slowly moving it to your desired place. But yes, it is adjustable so you can mold it to your head shape and allow it to wrap around your head to your liking.<br />Another suggestion, you should invest in an eyeglass repair kit that comes with the little screwdriver made specifically for small screws because the screws that hold the legs of the glasses can become looser over time, and you just need to tighten it every once in a while. It's not difficult at all, just a minor inconvenience at the worst.<br />It does come with its own case, little pamphlet, a proof of purchase, microfiber cloth and an authenticity card in the box. (The box opens very weirdly for those that have never bought Tag Heuer glasses, you have to pull at the tab on the end of the case, the end with the name and logo of the company, do not try to open the case like a traditional glasses case, pull at the end of the case. Sorry if this is complicated but I literally spent 5 minutes trying to figure this simple thing out when I bought my first pair, and I just thought I would save you the time.)<br />Other than that, this is a very light, resilient, and a malleable frame that is worth the price. (The only reason why I'm replacing mine is because I accidentally sat on it (I know, I know, embarrassing), and the hinges (silver part) along with the actual part of the frames (the black part) where the legs fold broke and I wasn't able to glue it back together.)"
4.0,"I have thin calves (14.5&#34;) and very thin ankles (9.5&#34;), so these are right on the verge of being too big around my legs. I decided to keep them though, because they look okay, and are very comfortable."
4.0,The size a little bigger then expected.
4.0,Love it. Not too heavy but very warm and comfortable. Washed welll. Air dried.
4.0,Boughy it for my dsughter so cant speak to a lot except to say she loves it.  So guess that means i love it too because she is very picky when it vomes to clothes
4.0,Sturdy material but kinda tight around the face. The graphics are spot on though.
4.0,"I AM 5'5""TALL, 38"" WAIST, DDD CUP SIZE. I PURCHASED A SIZE SMALLER THAN WHAT THE SIZE CHART SUGGETED. I PURCHASED AN  XL. THE FIT IS RIGHT FOR MY BODY TYPE, COMFORTABLE NOT TIGHT.  NO EXCESS MATERIAL ON THE SIDES.  THE COLOR IS A DEEP YELLOW. IT  IS NOT A SUNSHINE YELLOW, IT IS SIMULAR  TO A LIGHT MUSTARD SHADE. THE LENGTH FALLS BELOW MY ANKLES, WITH SHOES ON IT WILL LIFT UP HIGHER."
4.0,"It sits off my shoulders a bit too much/far, but I really like it. Just wish the sleeves were quarter length instead of long."
4.0,I would give it 5 stars if it were bigger.  I usually were a medium and have straight hair; this hat is very snug.  If I had curly or coarse hair I don't think it would fit.
4.0,"I love these frames.  They are very sturdy and look cool.  Unfortunately, I took them to Costco to get lenses and they contacted me after a week and said that they could not put lenses in these frames.  Not sure the reason why.  I just took them into my optometrist and we will see what happens.  To be continued....."
4.0,"This dress was great for a fall wedding guest dress. I was also nursing a newborn so the deep V cut and button at the chest was essential for practicality. Perfect length, good quality material and I received several compliments."
4.0,Never thought it could be this nice. Loves it soo much. Fits perfectly well. Will purchase again and again with different colors.
4.0,I ordered a size up from my normal US size and it fits fine.  I like the placement of the graphic.  I have the white shirt; the material is somewhat thin so I wear it layered over another shirt which is great for those cooler games.
4.0,Great for 4 - 8 year old girls. It is a cute glassy-like bracelet and has a great sentimental value.
4.0,I wore the dress to church
4.0,Item arrived on time as promised. Only 4 star because it was not packed securly it was put in a small plastic bag then inside mailing bag unlike other things that I previusly ordered from other seller. My item arrived with dings and the point broken. But because it has a nice color and shine and its calling me made me decide to keep it. The product  is nice. I highly recommend the product but not the way they shipped it.
4.0,Fits as expected.  Looks nice on me.  Biggest complaint is how long it took to arrive.  The arrival date kept getting pushed back.  It took almost 5 months to arrive.
4.0,Nice but would have preferred yellow vs white metal.
4.0,"Very pretty, but it took forever (it seemed) to get it"
4.0,"This is a cute shirt, and really well made for the price point. Take the sizing advice! I usually wear a 10/12 in shirts, as my arms and shoulders are on the larger size. I ordered a 3X and it's perfect."
4.0,"Comfortable,  fit is larger than I expected, but wear as a swimsuit cover-up."
4.0,I liked the design of the hoodie; however the material was a little thin and smelled kind of weird when it came in. It also took really long to ship the item. It runs kinda small as well I would get a size up especially if you‚Äôre like me and you like your hoodies a little more loose.
4.0,"I am more than pleased with the outfit - it is too cute! I got the white one and I was a little nervous that it would be cheap, thin material, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is actually very thick material and love the textured, quilted design. The only thing is the top is a little bulky but it can be overcome with a little altering. Also I wish the pants were a little more tapered and fight tighter across the ankles, as it appeared in the photo. But all in all, I can't wait to wear it!!"
4.0,Great style and color. Not expensive but look like it. I have these in another color and would order again.
4.0,"I absolutely love the design on these tights, but they are extremely tight on my bum. I am 5'0&#34; and 108 lbs and not curvy at all."
4.0,"Fit well, love it, just as described and pictured"
4.0,I liked the the color and the fit but find it hard to change out the lenses to use one of the other different colors.
4.0,Way too small and my 15 yr old always wears women's small size. Fast delivery tho
4.0,"The dress looked and felt great the one time I got to wear it. Sadly, my husband did laundry and did not know to pull this dress! The color is faded and the dress looks 10yrs & 200 washes old. Hopefully it would not have done this if washed properly."
4.0,I have a small face so I have a hard time finding sun glasses that look right on me and don‚Äôt cover my entire face. These are the perfect size and super cute. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give them five stars is because they are a little flimsy/delicate. You have to be very careful when handing them or you will either bend them or break them.
4.0,"These slippers are VERY comfortable, sturdy, and warm. They are extremely durable and well made. I wear them everyday and they still look brand new after months of use. The sole has excellent grip and bends well. They clean-up very easy in case of soiling. The only complaint I have is the low back. But, that is just a preference. I like a lot of structure around the back of my foot to provide a secure feel. If they had a higher back, my rating would be five stars all the way."
4.0,"Good sunglasses for the price but do not believe it when they say these are for large heads! Regular to medium head, your good to go. Build quality and the lenses appear to be pretty good. Would buy if they made them in a proper x-large frame. Until then I'm going to have to return this pair."
4.0,"There is a big discrepancy in sizing. I have ordered two pairs. One black, one grey. The black pair is baggy in the waist and fits a little loose in my legs. They stretch out a ton when I wear them, probably because it started out a little big. Knowing this, when I ordered the second pair, I considered getting a small. I am so glad I DIDN'T. The grey pair was so tight when I first got them that I thought I had ordered the small. I didn't. They were skin tight. Fortunately, I bought them for working out and since that's going well they fit better now, but holy geez, they were so tight I thought I was going to be able to pull them up! They nearly cut off the circulation to my lower leg.<br /><br />That being said, I would still recommend them. They are great for working out, not at all restrictive and I've never once been concerned about my butt showing during squats. They are a nice material and seem to hold up well."
4.0,This is the cutest got so my baby can wear to Disney land yay
4.0,"Love how light-weight these are.  I have these in the blue and red.  Both have white marks on the nose piece where the two lenses join.  This makes them look kind of cheap... which they are.  Still my favorite readers right now, and I have gajillions!"
4.0,Wouldn't actually use it for anything else.
4.0,I love the ring it was very good quality and it fit perfectly I just wish that it could have been packaged a little better
4.0,very nice quality but smaller than described. oh well.
4.0,Decent quality but this was a little high priced to me but I needed for a gift.
4.0,"I was looking for a replacement bottle insulator not for an eco-friendly bpa-free stainless steel jug, but for my 20oz Diet Mountain Dew and 20oz water bottles. (I know, I'm bad...)<br /><br />It fits various shapes comfortably, it appears to be well-made. I wish that it came in colors other than black to keep beverages cooler. I'm heading to the beach and a black bottle insulator is sort of self-defeating to keep things cool.<br /><br />I like the plastic hook to attach to a purse or other bag. The holes at the top of the tote are not very practical for me, but that's strictly a personal preference."
4.0,my son like it.
4.0,"I'm 5'5 129lbs, M fits just right, it would be better if it's slightly bigger. But I'm still satisfied with it. The color is pretty pure white, not see-through."
4.0,This would have been a great buy if the dress was shorter in length and the ruffles were a bit more detailed as shown in picture. I‚Äôm still going to wear it but I would have to give it some assist with a thicker belt to create a more forming shape to it.
4.0,it is for my husband looks good on him
4.0,"We got these for throwing our dogs their birthday party. They stayed on our dogs heads (supervised of course!) and our four children enjoyed them just as much as my husband and I did. They were very durable and were able to withstand four children running around with them and tugging on them, ect. The only thing I didn't like about it is the pom poms on top really had no way of staying on there easily and so those actually fell off pretty quickly."
4.0,Looks like candy on your tongue!
4.0,good product fit for my size
4.0,I don‚Äôt particularly like how they look but I like how they feel. Sleeps great.
4.0,"A little baggy under the arms, but still really adorable. Love this dress, and I always get a lot of compliments when I wear it."
4.0,**update** bought a pair In black and had to return them as they were see through. They do say that they are not squat proof but even bending over you can see EVERYTHING through them. The green color were great but black not so much. I did size down to an XS in the black and they did fit perfect other than you could see through them. I will probably order another pair in a different color though as I am pleased with the green ones.<br /><br />These are great for working out. I did full cardio and you could barely see any sweat through the leggings. The only thing is that they are a little large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äô and 120lbs and the smalls are large around my butt and crotch and bunch a little. Based on reviews I sized up to a small but I think an XS would fit better. If I‚Äôm between sizes I would size down. They are compressive but not too tight.
4.0,It‚Äôs greatly made ! Just really big and bulky also heavy.
4.0,Fairly decent waist lighting solution.  Comfortable to wear and the adjustability of the light is adequate.  The broad beam is decent for slower actvities and the narrow beam for faster ones.<br /><br />I would like the beam mode to be a dash brighter but it works well for most activities.  The main improvement I would like to see is to have a third mode with both lights on that would be ideal for trail running where it pays to see whats in the distance and a broad path just before you.
4.0,"Firstly, caution about ordering your size.  DO NOT order your regular size, these skorts are cut to suit the smaller asian builds but the product info did not mention this clearly enough.  I am a small so usually that's what I order, waaaaayyyy too tight.  Ordered the Medium instead and it fits as if it were a small size.  I am 4'11"" and the length of skirt hits right at the top of the knee which is what I preferred.  I have the green patterned skort which is a lovely rich deep teal green and would be suitable enough to even wear to the office.  Shorts underneath are black and very comfy, not too tight.  Highly recommend."
4.0,"Items are great. Small mix up by the seller though. I just looked at it as xxxx happens. I ordered two pairs of purple and blue, but both pairs were blue. They look good anyway and they're a nice light weight too."
4.0,"I'd probably rate this a 5 star if it had a little stretch or maybe slightly more room in the shoulder, but otherwise the fit is fine and it satisfied my desire for a neutral polka-dot to go with a bright solid skirt. Husband loves it, so it passes that test and it was inexpensive.  A little sheer, but hardly noticeable with a completer piece.  Probably won't buy it in other colors, although I considered it."
4.0,This product fit just as expected.
4.0,"I'm using this band on an older 42mm Series 3 ceramic watch and the pieces lock into place very well on the watch. The magnets for the band are strong but you have to put it on the right way or it won't hold at all. It took me a minute to figure that out but now I know that the top strap goes over the lower one and it holds very well.<br /><br />There's a decent amount of adjustment but the magnets do ""lock"" into place in intervals, it's not infinitely adjustable. Overall, the quality of the straps is good and the synthetic leather material looks nice and is easy to wipe clean when needed."
4.0,"Nice quality suede, attractive design, three points of adjustability. Comfy footbed. I normally wear between a 9 and a 9.5 medium; these are a 9 and fit great. They are very lightweight. Overall, I'm very pleased with these sandals."
4.0,"Comfortable leggings. I have to keep hiking them up, or I'd give them 5 stars. But, I like them otherwise."
4.0,"A little bit smaller than I thought it would be but I'm completely fine with that! My old purse broke a few months ago so I had been using an over the shoulder bag. It was too long and didn't have pockets so it was annoying for everyday use. I'm picky when it comes to bags. Finally decided on this purse because of the purple color and pockets and I love it!<br /><br />Lots of pockets to organize, adjustable shoulder strap, good material. A great buy!<br /><br />Edit: I've been using it daily for over a month now. Still love it but the main zipper gets caught on the inside cloth quite often, super annoying. Had to remove a star for that as it happens a lot."
4.0,Item delivered was item as described. Quick delivery! Great packaging! Very happy! Thanks!
4.0,"These monster gloves are witch or frankenstien green not as pale as in picture.  Over all nice hands for a grown man, kind of on the large side. I had purchased these for a very pale vampire costume, will not work for this, so I will find another use for them."
4.0,"Carabiner just a little small, tough finish."
4.0,Really good value for the price. Some of the metal looks a little cheap but for less then a dollar a pair I can deal with that. Otherwise very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"So comfortable! They come up nice and high, hiding my mom bod. They're a little big in the waist, though."
4.0,This dress is as described and the fit was as expected. It is not a fitted dress so the only concern is if the sleeves are large enough. I usually wear a medium and the medium sleeves were a little snug but still fit. It is a beautiful dress if you want a comfortable dress.
4.0,Great gift for kids
4.0,"Great hat. Wife tolerates it well. Bendable rim, breathable, and a strap for wind. Just don't expect it to last too long, the straw material is not exactly the most durable."
4.0,Used this to put my baby‚Äôs toys .. i thought at first is big but its not .. all is good tho
4.0,Runs small order at least a size up
4.0,I love how they come with multiple different sizes. Good purchase but I have noticed to be careful and watch because the backs down like staying on well. But other than that it was worth the money.
4.0,These were perfect for my mermaid Halloween costume! I am 5'2&#34; and 115 pounds with big hips/butt so I ordered a medium & they fit perfectly. I normally wear small bottoms but i decided to go up a size and glad that I did. Perfect length - a little loose in the crotch area but otherwise very comfortable and got lots of compliments!
4.0,"Good product for $11 but too small for my 7-3/8‚Äù hat size. I didn‚Äôt expect high end designer frames or comfort, but these frames were constructed of a sturdy plastic that seemed comfortable for the 3 minutes I had them on. I would recommend these frames to an individual with a smaller hat size than 7-3/8‚Äù."
4.0,Runs a  Little bit small . I would recommend  sizing up!
4.0,Wish it had a built in bra
4.0,"If you are expecting blk. lenses you will be disappointed; they are the color in the photo, which is not what I call blk., and fine by me.  I am completely satisfied."
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and about 170lbs. I wasn't sure if I should order an XXL or an XXXL. So, I guestimated after looking at other customer reviews. The hood is HUGE btw... no way I'll be able to wear it and see where I am going. The shoulders are a bit tight... I won't be wearing a sweater underneath this, that's for sure. I'd have to wear fabric that is a bit more thin or it wouldn't get on. And the breast area, as always, does not fit well. My breasts are pretty large. So if you are busty, be forewarned. But had I ordered a size bigger I think it would have been swimming on me in all other areas. So I may be a tough fit for this particular coat. However, it is nice looking, arrived in great condition, and is def warm. I'd suggest maybe moving the buttons a little more inward for us busty gals. Maybe adding one so we aren't squeezing them in so hard? But yeah, it's a good coat for it's price."
4.0,Very cute outfit. I‚Äôll order more color if it‚Äôs available.
4.0,"This is a really substantial, quality belt- and a great buy. It has a large buckle and take note of the width, it took up my entire belt loop, leaving no room to tuck in the 'tail'."
4.0,"Summary: Great quality and thickness, clear text/pictures, a high quality t-shirt. But undersized (read on).<br /><br />I am a petite woman (5'1"") and I ordered a men's size Medium. Most men's size medium t-shirts fit me well because the arms are roomy, the fabric is thicker/warmer than women's t-shirts and there is ample room in the chest (I am chesty). I also prefer men's t-shirts over women's t-shirts because the neckline (even if crewneck) tends to be wider / looser. I hate shirts that are tight around the neckline.<br /><br />When I first opened this, I thought it was a child's t-shirt, that's how small of an opening the neck hole has! I just know I'm going to wear it and feel that 'I am being choked' feeling. If I had bought a size large it would have been comically big-looking on me, but at least the neck hole probably would have been larger."
4.0,take care when putting them on.  I am concerned they will bend.
4.0,"The belt fits great and is of good quality. My issue is with the description. The reversible belt is listed as being black on one side and white on the other. However, the white isn't really white. It's more like a light grey. I still like it, but the product description needs to be more accurate. Other than that, it's a great belt."
4.0,"Nice sweater. It‚Äôs warm, but the material balls up quickly. Still consider it to be a good purchase for the price!"
4.0,My son wears a toddler 3 and these fit perfectly.  He has a very chunky foot and these shoes were still able to velcro and fit. They get dirty easily but wash well!
4.0,I sent this to my 11 year old granddaughter who loves One Direction.  She liked them very much. It was part of a birthday package.
4.0,Kinda cheap material . Works good enough with filter to slay me some dirty horde scum. For the alliance
4.0,"Use this for Mardi Gras, didn't read until afterwards that the tights was for shorter women. I'm 5' 8"" so I had to cut my feet out the toe to make longer. But apart from that they where great."
4.0,"A great deal for the price.  This 4-pack allows you to pick the right band for the watch and the outfit.  The hardware is a bit on the cheap side (thin metal) but seems strong enough.  The substitution of a fabric loop for the customary two metal loops to retain the extra length of the strap seems like a cost savings measure, but I find I prefer it over the metal loops."
4.0,NOT AS NICE AS SHOWN IN PICTURE.
4.0,"soft fabric, soft color! Instead of a large, I could have worn medium."
4.0,"This dress is adorable, especially if you have a very long torso, (which is why I only rated it with 4 stars)... It almost seems as if several inches of the top portion were accidentally sewn on, therefore causing it to bunch up in a VERY unflattering way directly underneath my ribcage. After extensive research (reading reviews) I ended up buying a medium, as I am 5'7&#34; and 135 lbs... (and apparently I have a rather short torso!)... Other than that, the fabric and overall quality of this dress is fantastic."
4.0,"Cute and simple, not too long for my height."
4.0,"The dress fits exactly as you see in the picture--and I love it! The pockets are a really useful addition for small items you might want to carry with you. The only thing that mildly disappointed me was that the top part of the dress was somewhat tight. So if you're a person that has a pretty large bust or wide-set shoulders, the top will be quite fitted. I received lots of compliments on the dress and was overall pleased with it!"
4.0,Glasses really set off the whoe outfit. So glad I got them.
4.0,Nice quality and fabric but 3x ran small.
4.0,Good strong hold. Fits as expected.
4.0,Thought I was getting the magnetized ones.  These are pins.  Heavy quality product though.
4.0,"This outfit is super cute! But the material is not very stretchy so it fit kind of tight and was a little bit short for my liking. I could not wear underwear with it. I am 5'7"" and 140 lbs and ordered a medium."
4.0,"Soft and stretchy, not too fitting!.  My only complaint would be that the cowl's edge is not really finished- there is an overcast stitch, but it would look more finished with a regular hem."
4.0,"These are thicker than your typical legging, but they aren't really fleece lined. They have a thicker material, but aren't super warm. They are also a little shiny--just slightly. Overall, great purchase for the price!"
4.0,This band is really comfortable and easy to use. I would have given 5 stars but the band has a tendency to loosen and you need to readjust it frequently.
4.0,They were as described and super cute!
4.0,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of fashion coords with satin skirts lately and wanted to try the style before investing 60+$ into a piece. The material is very light, and reminds me of satin lining fabric or costume satin. I‚Äôve washed it and it held up very well, with air drying. Exactly what was expected for the price and suits my needs just fine. Following the size chart the sizing is accurate. Good deal to try a new style"
4.0,I use this head band to plop my wet hair at night. Fits perfectly stays in place.
4.0,It‚Äôs fits
4.0,"At this price point I highly recommend. The construction is done fairly well. I like that it is a true wrap dress and is adjustable rather than a faux wrap w/an elastic waist. The length is good and the skirt is full. The material has a slight sheen and is medium weight. i would‚Äôve liked it more if it was a natural material, but not a deal breaker. What I don‚Äôt like is that the ties are a little too high. It would‚Äôve been more flattering if those sat at the smallest part of the natural waist. But again, at this price point it is a worthwhile buy."
4.0,These are a very pretty color.  I ordered them because of the saying.  They certainly are not top quality but for the price I am pleased.
4.0,"Everyone loves this shirt,  me too."
4.0,Great fit just smelled weird had to deep wash but it's all good
4.0,Love that there is a matching adult size so my two boys can match and the baby can look like a mini me of his dad. It's a little hard to adjust and keep taught though.
4.0,Not much to write - it came in a nice box that looked gift wrapped.  The bracelet looked just like the picture.
4.0,Pretty design and color but the material of the leaf is a bit cheap.
4.0,Fun.  Cheap. Buy for fun. Not really quality.
4.0,"This is a very pretty watch, but the fit is a little smaller than standard. It fit me, (I have an average size wrist, 6 3/8&#34;), but I didn't care for how snug it felt. I gave it to my daughter who is quite petite, and she is pleased with it."
4.0,My boyfriend normall wears XL so i got him 2XL and it almost didnt zip up. Order 1-2 sizes up. Nice quality seems comfy. The images are a little blurry tho.
4.0,"Flattering & fit as expected.  I'm 5'8&#34; 170lbs ordered a size 12.  Only downside,  the darker color towards the top is velvet making this dress (for me) only wearable in winter/ holidays."
4.0,"I bought this dress to have a fall maxi dress option, since most of my maxi dresses are bright, floral and sleeveless. I ordered both the 3/4 length and short sleeves because I was afraid it would be too tight on my arms. I was also prepared to hem it since most reviewers were saying how long the dress was. I ordered a medium; I'm 5' 2&#34;, and I honestly avoid knowing how much I weigh, but I have some serious thighs (at least a 10 in jeggings), a tummy, and carry a lot of fat in my upper arms, which often stops me from fitting into things with longer sleeves. I was very pleasantly surprised, though, to find it was a good length, a little long when standing but not a tripping hazard, and the sleeves were very comfortable. I definitely preferred the 3/4 length because the short sleeves looked more like a long t-shirt dress, and was for sending reason longer. No, the stripes don't match perfectly on the sides but I figure with the flowy-ness of the skirt and my arms covering the side it won't be terribly noticible. It is also a little itchy but from other reviews I'm hoping that will go away after washing."
4.0,great for the dog lover!  I wish that there was a better quality one available like 14k white gold...
4.0,Nice looking.  Smaller than I expected though.
4.0,The swimsuit is beautiful but the top has no support for larger busts.
4.0,"The fit on these are nice. I like that they are rimless sunglasses. The look and feel of them are great. The color I got seems to be a little difficult to see through clearly which is why I gave it 4 stars as compared to my expensive polarized sunglasses. You get used to the color after wearing for a while just a different look than I‚Äôm used to. Overall, great sunglasses."
4.0,"130lbs 34B Size 28 in jeans. Ordered a small for bust and the top fit great! The bottoms were very tight for my liking, but so cute! They had decent coverage too. Kept the top and gave bottoms to a friend. Will probably order a large for the bottoms and get rid of the top. Overall very happy with the quality and sizing was what I expected. Can't beat the price."
4.0,I love the color and animal print.  Product looks just like the picture.  Will be sporting these on every sunny day
4.0,These are very light weight sunglasses. The polarization works nicely. The frames are a bit large for my face.
4.0,Es hermoso. Lo √∫nico que viene un poco peque√±o del busto. Soy talla L pero ped√≠ XL y a√∫n as√≠ me quedo un poco ajustado del busto . La tela es de buena calidad y muy lindo dise√±o .
4.0,This is a really nice person it's a little smaller than I thought but I bought it for my daughter-in-law for Christmas and she loves green so I guess I'll see how she likes it but it is a little small
4.0,I don't understand how geniuian leather jeans it is fake leather its fake
4.0,"I ordered this particular color/print (black/leopard) because I had previously ordered the blue/plaid set and loved how soft and comfortable they were.  This pair...not so much.  Not uncomfortable, but by no means as comfortable as the other pair.  Also, size seemed just a tiny bit smaller..again, don't know if this was because of the material or not.  Still a good bargain and they ARE comfortable."
4.0,"For the price, these rings hold their shape and look decent."
4.0,very comfortable and stylish....loved it...too cute...a little large than my size but I guess good to be layered then.
4.0,"Very pretty, fit my 13 year old perfect!"
4.0,"This is a nice looking cuff, the metal is a bit thin so you can press the edges of this to close more firmly on your wrist when wearing.  Its nice but I don't know if that will effect the overall integrity of the metal allowing it to break /crack after minimal use.  I have had no tarnish marks or skin irritations while wearing.  Its comfortable on my wrist.  Price point is decent for what you get.  Presentation packaging is super cute if planning on giving as a gift."
4.0,Run small.  I brought  two size bigger.  I recommend these socks when traveling.
4.0,"After reading the reviews ordered it in a larger sizes, to giving me more room in tummy area. Received many compliments."
4.0,"Love it!! it was exactly as described! fits very nicely, I am 5'7&#34;  at 195 lbs and I got a large. I have a little belly but it still fits!"
4.0,"Very spacious inside and easy to clean. It seems durable however it is very bland. Almost wish I had gotten a different color but overall a very good, durable purse."
4.0,Too cute! This would make an adorable gift. I love the pockets and the colors.
4.0,It was a little to long for me. I‚Äôm a little on the short side (5ft) üòÇ but it‚Äôs ok! It really doesn‚Äôt fall off the shoulder too much but it‚Äôs perfect for a normal day! Ty
4.0,Right on the package it stated that it's not squat proof. It feels like an okay type of material. I'll update when I wear for one of my work outs.
4.0,Nice and solid. But the lock gets unlocked and falls
4.0,"The dress fit well, and the color was accurate with the picture shown. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and around 155 lbs and ordered a medium. (I ordered the olive green). As with a lot of dresses from Amazon, not amazing quality but what you‚Äôd expect for such an affordable price. Works well with leggings, too. All in all, a good purchase."
4.0,"very cute, wife is happy"
4.0,"Fit well, super comfortable."
4.0,I bought this dress for my trip. It fits great! I bought a small. I'm 5'1 and 129 lbs. It is rayon so I'm making sure NOT to throw it in the dryer.
4.0,Kinda small. It‚Äôs cute.
4.0,Love this top!  It's sweet and feminine and looks great w/ leggings.  I have it in red and yellow!
4.0,fits great around the head and stays on (even if you have a lot of hair). the picture makes it look slouchy but its not it fits pretty snug like a sock hat
4.0,Bra is super comfy. Love it so much. However it pulls so much even if I air dry it. Wish it didn‚Äôt pill.
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34;, ordered the medium and this is pretty short on me. It fits well otherwise, and good material."
4.0,Exactly as pictures but it is conspicuous with the large brim.
4.0,"I really wanted to love this jumpsuit, but it was too small. I typically wear a medium or 7/9 in bottoms. For reference I am 5‚Äô3. This jumpsuit fit in size, but not length. I‚Äôm not a very tall person, and this was uncomfortable on me. The straps are adjustable, which is nice, but even with them being adjustable the bottom was uncomfortable. The problem that I had was that the crotch area was too high, so for someone taller this would not work either. It would fit someone with a shorter torso I guess, although I do not have a long torso only being 5‚Äô3.<br />I‚Äôm still giving this a 4/5 because the quality of the jumpsuit seemed really nice. It wasn‚Äôt see through, had adjustable straps, and the fabric was a nice quality."
4.0,Very nice.  I would have like just a little larger but they did the trick for a Christmas party.
4.0,I purchased this charm for my endless bracelet. It's a nice addition! Very like the image shown.
4.0,"Great quality. Feels good in the hand. Magnet is very strong. Window gives a good view of my classically handsome mug. Only drawback, slightly wider than I would have liked. They could have shaved a few millimeters, and made a huge impact."
4.0,Really cute slippers.  Ran a bit small.
4.0,Very nice looking shirt I bought for my husband. Quality seems nice and fits as expected.
4.0,I bought these a bit large so as to easily get them on while wearing my shoes.  They work great and are easy to get on and off.
4.0,"This is a very well made boys shoe.  It looks very cool in the picture, however, once on the foot the laces are a little awkward.  The velcro strap over the laces is a neat style feature, but then when you tie the laces, the laces hang sloppily over the velcro.  What I ended up doing was curling up each lace end and made a little knot, like was the cool way to tie Bass loafers back in the 80's.  This way, tied laces are not flopping over the shoe and ruining the look of the velcro strap.  My son's pant hem covers the curled up laces, thankfully, but he also thinks the curly-q laces are kinda neat.  He says they look like antennae."
4.0,"At the time of purchase this dress is available through several sellers: Elesol and Zeagoo.<br /><br />It is an OK cotton (t-shirt type of fabric) material.<br />It is not see-through, it is not too thin.<br />It feels like a good quality.<br />It is cute, summery, girly and playful.<br /><br />However the sizing of this dress is way off at least one size.<br /><br />I am 5'5'' 144 lb, 36DD/E. My measurements are 39.8 (101cm)/ 34 (87cm)/ 39.8 (101cm)<br />I ordered size S and it is just huge.<br />I can not even imagine how someone with the smaller bust will look in it!<br /><br />After ordering from Elesol I tried Zeagoo hoping that their sizing will be better and it was not the case.<br />So the whole review describes both of my orders.<br />Both came in Meaneor brand bag :)<br />White dress is from Elesol, burgundy one is from Zeagoo.<br /><br />I really liked the look and the feel of the dress.<br />Super light and comfy.<br />I would have definitely exchanged if smaller size was available."
4.0,Dress fits as expected. Comfortable and cute.
4.0,"Excellent value.  The product looks very good, fit the watch perfectly, and was offered at a very reasonable price - a great deal."
4.0,Fits great I‚Äôm 197 and in a Large. Not totally sure if their squat proof especially if you have a larger butt and hips.
4.0,Great for the price. You can't fold brim. I like to fold up in front. Still like it. It is true to picture.
4.0,good for camping in winter
4.0,"Reversible belts are so handy! One belt, two looks - especially great for traveling. This belt is somewhere between average and high quality. It's better than a lot of the cheaper belts my husband has gotten at the local discount store, but it's not quite as nice as the high end belt that his mother got him for Christmas one year. I would say it's probably comparable to what you would get at a department store. It has been very simple to switch the primary color of the belt. My husband has not had any problems with the buckle coming off when in use. The leather looks nice and real - not  synthetic. My husband has been very pleased with this for his everyday attire.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own."
4.0,Decent headband.  Not as high quality as Junk brand but for the price they are great
4.0,"These shirts are comfortable and look nice, however, you should plan to use a fabric shaver after every wear because these shirts are very prone to pilling."
4.0,"GREAT PIECE, I LOVE IT."
4.0,I‚Äôm a size 8 and the large fit me.
4.0,A little too big on me
4.0,"Great product just fit a bit tight around my calves so I decided to return. But Seller was great, product arrived on time and truly made well! It just didn't work for me but very nice SPF pants"
4.0,"Great case to store the remote key fob. I wish the sides were hardened and it did not squished down. The reason I got it was to keep the remote buttons from getting pressed in my pocket but since it is a soft case they can still get pressed easily.  So I found pieces of metal and bent it to support the inside of the case and make a inner shell and works better now.<br />  There also was no way to remove the huge buckle on the side so I had to cut it off which was a shame since there is no way to just temporarily remove/unclip it.<br /><br />Been using it for a few months now and works great, very durable."
4.0,"I loved the Sumikko Gurashi character concepts for the keys, but they got dirty easily and torn.  I've had it for a little over a month now. Tokage (the blue dino) is about to fall off. I did attach him to a key ring because I didn't feel comfortable leaving him on the bead chain it came with. I almost lost a different key because of that reason. The little holding loops couldn't withstand the everyday use. Also, if you live in the U.S., like me, our house keys are smaller than the key holders, so although it won't slip out of the bottom, it will keep slipping back into the sleeve unless you glue it (which I did). I still love it and will keep using it.<br /><br />(Neko (the cat) looks like its been living on the streets abandoned!)"
4.0,Took forever to arrive from China. They are cool. Will see how they hold up.
4.0,Fits perfect. There were antiperspirant stains on the dress. I‚Äôm sure it was returned and not washed. Not a huge deal.
4.0,"I like it, I purchased to replace another and was exactly what I expected.  Item did smell awful but I filled a large bowl with cold water added my favorite liquid laundry/fabric softener let it soak for about 15-20min then lightly rinsed (clean cold water), did not ring-out, just hung to drip-air dry (placed on clothes hanger and hung on bathroom showerhead til' dry). It worked for me but try your own experiment then share with us buyers.  Seller's description of product is exact."
4.0,Super cute cheap frames for fun.
4.0,The product was as described but they are loose and the drawstring doesn't go all the way around the shorts. Delivery and services rendered were great!
4.0,It ws different to what I saw on line but it is ok.
4.0,"While it's very pretty, it's a bit large, chunky, if you will.  I would have like an instruction card to better utilize the mysteries.  Other than that, I think it's lovely and would recommend it for someone like me who is getting to know the Rosary."
4.0,Very nice shirt.  Does feel like it shrunk a little bit after the first washing.
4.0,My favorite little wiggle dress for showing off the hips ;)
4.0,The paint chipped off one of my blue pairs but they are still cute and very comfortable to wear.
4.0,Bought as a gift for my Mom. She loves it!
4.0,"Wish the sewn on piece in the palms was a little more ""grippy"". Otherwise perfect."
4.0,Love it! material is ok.
4.0,I used this for my uggs boots and it did clean them it‚Äôs just u have to do so much scrubbing maybe it‚Äôs not ment for uggs or boots lol
4.0,Was very simple and pretty although it's way too long for a petite girl.
4.0,Cute and well-being made but the bust area is way too big for me ( 34C cup).
4.0,"Good news and bad news.<br />First the bad news. I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift, it was one of the few items in his wishlist, upon putting it on his wrist we noticed how tiny it looked in comparison to his hand, it wasn‚Äôt really a good look.<br /><br />Good news, I now have a cool watch that tells me the day of the week and the date, so in case I ever lose track of time completely I‚Äôll be good until my battery dies.<br /><br />I love this watch, but they should probably change it to women‚Äôs*"
4.0,"LIKES: I am 5'7&#34; and the length hits right at the knee. I don't even need the side zipper as it fits nicely around the torso and I can get it on and off with the buttons. Color is as pictured - a deep gold. Fabric is not see-through ISSUES: Not crazy about little cap sleeves, but given that the rest fits very well, I can live with the sleeves. I washed this as directed, before wearing, so I might get the wrinkles out. Cold water, delicate cycle, line dry. Still crumpled. Sorry, I'm fussy. So I ironed it, and needed loads of steam. I used a light touch with my iron (so I wouldn't burn the fabric), but wonder if I should just get a steamer instead.  Or can I dry-clean it? I purchased this dress because I needed something a little retro for an event."
4.0,I really loved this . The only problem I had was it wasn't small enough for my wrist. I have a skinny wrist and have a problem usually finding the right fit. Most people should have no problem. I love the color (blues & pink) and  very comfortable. I would give it a five star if it was snug on my wrist.
4.0,"Very comfortable, hooks and zipper!"
4.0,I was worried it  would come and  be that bright red and surprisingly  its the actual color which i love! Romwe seems to like that bathing  suit material  for their tops  and it do keep me cool  in  the summer  . I got a XL and  i m 186 and 5'6 perfect  fit.
4.0,"The color is more grayish, but it's a cute tracksuit! However I do want to mention the material feels like cooling material so it's not warm."
4.0,"I have only tried these on, but I will definitely be wearing them soon. They are beyond comfortable & flattering. They will be perfect for work. Seriously, I think I found the ideal teacher pants! The only reason I took off a star is because they are a bit snug through the hips but otherwise they fit like a dream."
4.0,My daughter loved her shirt. The colors were not as bright as I thought they would be but it is still very cute.
4.0,Very nice for the price! My daughter is getting baptized in it Sunday !
4.0,"This was great for my toddler for a photo shoot with my newborn. It fit great and was decent quality. The little bow on the front frayed and halfway fell off after the first wash, so I ended up cutting it off. Absolutely loved the color."
4.0,Love the look. Only downside: the band wears over time (I‚Äôve had it for about a month) though slower than most other watches. The design of the bands conceals it.
4.0,FITS PERFECT!!!
4.0,Looks just like the image and it was super cute but a little more towards the 18 month side.
4.0,"It's cute and comfortable--a simple sweater that is not itchy.  It is not worth $30, but it's nice!"
4.0,"Bought them for my mom , she loves them"
4.0,"Item: Calhoun NHL Mens Short Sleeve Rash Guard Wicking T-Shirt<br /><br />Price (at time of review *): $29.95<br />(* Note that I receive some items at discounted or zero cost through Amazon Vine participation.  The price indicated is the purchase price, with or without discounts, as advertised on the product page at the time this review is posted)<br /><br />Pros: Shirt fits well to size and the material is typical of a moisture wicking t-shirt, which is to say it is lightweight and feels almost silky against the skin.  It is comfortable and cool, so should be useful in warmer weather.  The team logo and design has a nice appearance and the shirt is licensed by the NHL.<br /><br />Cons:  The arms are a bit short and the gaps are oversized, such that your armpits will show when your arms are raised.  Not a major issue, but I tend to prefer slightly longer sleeves without that amount of space.  At roughly thirty dollars, these are currently overpriced.<br /><br />Ratings (1-10 scale; 0 = Very poor, 5 = Average, 10 = Exceptional)<br />Quality: 7<br />Value (based on purchase price of $29.95): 4.5<br />Utility: 7<br />Overall: 6.5<br /><br />Hopefully you found this review helpful in identifying the best product to meet your needs."
4.0,"The quality was very nice on these bras but I thought they ran slightly small, and I runneth over, which was not comfortable for me. I did try another brand that worked out better."
4.0,"The bags are cute but a little smaller than I was hoping for. Also it would be nice to have the option to buy a few extra bags, since the lots come in 7 or 12. We might have 13 or 14 people so that makes it tough.<br /><br />Bags came quickly and appear as advertised. Canvas bag quality looks good."
4.0,"The small fit more like a medium, more like tunic length if that's what youre looking for. Otherwise nice top. Good quality."
4.0,This dress is perfect!! ‚ÄúElegant & Sexy‚Äù!!!
4.0,"it was a bit smaller than expected--especially once my pet was inside the pocket--so depending on your pet's size, you may want to go up a size."
4.0,Quality is good but if your foot is for the upper end of the size you may want to consider going up a size in the slipper.
4.0,Was too small and didn‚Äôt stay on well.
4.0,The dress is super cute and the material is nice but it runs large. I weigh 130lbs so I got a small and it was too loose in the stomach/hip area. Really wish there was a xsmall size.
4.0,"Still very cute although the sleeves are not like they are pictured. Sleeves are shorter, a bit larger than I thought it would be. Will definitely be wearing a bralette underneath bc I can‚Äôt lean over at all. After reading other reviews I don‚Äôt think I will be washing or drying it either. I will just dry clean it, still a super cute piece to style for Fall! Ordered a small, 5‚Äô4 and125 lbs, still very loose with lots of room. Size down!"
4.0,Smaller then thought
4.0,"Great value,  beautiful color blue, knit thin fabric,  very good quality."
4.0,"Crap crap crap. It looks lovely, however, the chain layer kept pulling and the pendant falling off. They did not spend the time to ensure that the link that hold the layers together at each end are close properly.<br />Update:- after my review I was contacted by the seller. I got a replacement necklace which was way better than the first. Great customer service I wouldn't hesitate to buy something else from this seller."
4.0,I love this dress! Conservative enough to wear to work but casual enough to wear out. The material is stretchy and very flattering. You can dress it up with heels or down with boots. I will definitely be buying this item again in other colors.
4.0,It was just as pictured. My granddaughter loved opening it and seeing what pearl was inside. A huge hit!
4.0,This rain poncho is greag for hiking on rainy days specially if carrying a book bag. I think it is too thin but I guess that is a plus for really hot and humid days so the poncho dont add extra heat. Also in the front pic it gives the impression that it comes with a  storage bag but it really comes folded inside his own pocket. No extra storage bag.
4.0,"The wording (compassion) is placed too low. It sits directly under my boobs, where it's not easy to read, thereby making people look like they are staring at my girls for the wrong reason. I'd gladly give it five stars if the writing were placed  higher.<br />Otherwise, super soft, comfy, and nicely made."
4.0,Good for one time use during costume party.
4.0,This is okay except I will have to put cotton or something under the bridge of the nose to make it sit away from the face just a little.  Its very hard and rough so it wouldn't take much for your face to have an abrasion.
4.0,"This pearl necklace is pretty, with uniformly round, evenly-sized, heavy, grey-colored pearls. The pearls have very slight peacock tones, but no way would I call the pearls ""black."" Dove-grey would be an accurate description of the ones I received. However, for the price, this is a very nice necklace, and I like the closure device. For $15, as long as you really don't want black pearls, you can't go wrong with this one."
4.0,Only issue I‚Äôm having is the strap keep coming a loose‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a little annoying.  Other than that is a cute purse.
4.0,Arms and top part fit great but its long
4.0,Este tiene la media bien gruesa.
4.0,Nice pendant but chain was too short in length.
4.0,Product is comfortable and a good fit.
4.0,"Muchas gracias, excelente producto"
4.0,"I love the material. High quality, soft knitting. However the sleeves were a bit short. May order a size up from what you would expect."
4.0,This is a &#34;boyfriend&#34; blouse.  Maybe I missed that in the reviews.  It's very loose but very pretty.  When it's warm enough to wear this it might look good w/my jeggings.  Hopefully.  It is sheer & light.  Some said it was too warm; I think it will be great for 75 degrees & above (for me).
4.0,"I ordered this to wear at my office for halloween and to answer the door for the kids. What a hit it was! Everyone thought it was amazing! Warning, however. The sizes are not at all what you would think. Fortunately I figured this out before ordering because it stated that the XL was a US Size 8. Oh my, wouldn't all the size 8 women be devastated to think they are an XL! I am a real US XL (approx. size 16/18) and therefore ordered the XXXL and it truly fit perfect!"
4.0,I will give it to my husbands mother as it is like a boat on me. Otherwise in the right size it would have been lovely.
4.0,"It really perfect with one acception, which I knew before I purchased it. I wish it were a real coin. LOL"
4.0,"I love this dress, but it  runs somewhat small in the top if you order according to the size chart.  Otherwise, I really do love it.  Dress has pockets and if you are average height or a bit tall, it will actually be long enough!"
4.0,Good Band.  Would be better if they included a little screwdriver to get the pins out with.
4.0,The shirt runs narrow and slim. It‚Äôs very snug. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm wearing  it with a jean duster to cover my muffin topüòú it‚Äôs beautiful. Love the rich colors. Wish  it wasn‚Äôt so snug. üò≥üò´fits like a small- I ordered a medium as usual
4.0,"The price was 9.99 when I bought several of these dresses. I like to wear maxis dresses in the winter. Material is thin but lounging at home with a sweater, perfect."
4.0,Very comfortable. An excellent purchase.
4.0,"I bought the lemon print dress. Originally I ordered the medium but it was too big so I exchanged it for the small. The small is still a bit loose in the waist, but I'm scared to exchange for the extra small, so I'll make do. My only complaint is the belt is missing. I really need that belt since it is a bit loose in the waist. The dress itself is super cute, though, and will be perfect for the summer wedding I'm planning to wear it to. For reference I am 5'7 about 145 lbs and wear a 36B."
4.0,I found these to just a little smaller than the typical large my wife wears. Otherwise these are a nice pair of workout leggings. With breathability and stretch it makes for a comfortable wear. The fabric doesn't bunch up. The thick waist band holds you in. So far is washes nicely too.
4.0,They look to be good quality and I like that they are polarized. The storage bag is also nice to have to minimize damage when not in use. Only negative for us is that they are a bit big on our 4 year old son‚Äôs face and fall off rather easily.
4.0,"Always a good purchase for kids. Useful for Halloween or night time fun for kids. Unlike glow sticks, these last longer, cheaper and come with on/off switch. Only draw back is, it's only 4 colors...one of which is white!"
4.0,"It was very pretty, but was brown."
4.0,"I really like this shirt - though for someone shorter than 5'5 or so, this could be worn as a dress. The material is thin, but I expected that and planned to wear it with a cami underneath. Goes great with leggings and skirts. I'll probably order another in a different color. Not a bad shirt for the price."
4.0,Cape is great. Dress is a bit thin. I will definitely need to wear long sleeve shirt and pants under when I go trick or treating with the kids.
4.0,Beautifulüòç
4.0,Clearly not going to last forever but for some inexpensive play shoes they're fine.
4.0,My twelve year old loves this case!  We loved how the initials were made on it.  I would have preferred the case wrap around the corners completely.  This is the reason for the ding on the star.
4.0,This product is overall comfortable. I like the color and design. I would liked to have the inner lining of the cup to be designed better aligning with the size of the pocket. Larger in size.
4.0,Very cute shoes. Not padded like Mini Melissa's but she likes them.
4.0,"got them for my wife, she said they are a good product"
4.0,"The dress is beautiful but not asymmetrical like the picture. Has 15 layers of ruffles, looked great after being steamed."
4.0,"This product fits the bill, no pun intended."
4.0,A little thinner than I expected. Nice feel and quality.
4.0,"Directions were pretty simple to follow and it is quite a nice belt with a unique-ish design. Only problem is that when wearing, the mechanism to unclasp the belt is on the underside of the buckle which is really awkward to try to manuever. It‚Äôs either that or wear the belt the opposite direction whicb is also awkward..."
4.0,Super soft chenille material in a light tan color. Medium fits slightly larger than normal. Unfortunately does not wash well and threads pulled out making it look like it‚Äôs many years old. I have other chenille sweaters and this hasn‚Äôt happened after washing them.
4.0,Better than expected. Very nice. Don't need the necklace but it's silver toned not gold like the tiara.
4.0,"Love the design, expected quality for price, but even too small for me and I'm 97 pounds üòä"
4.0,A bit long but fits well
4.0,They are made of good quality cotton that fits snugly to child's body. They are quite stretchy and show not shrink. I have washed them twice and they seem fine. The traffics are cute and they are proportioned well. The price is somewhat expensive though.
4.0,"I like the cloth, it has a satiny feel to it, but I felt like I was putting on pantyhose, they are tight! However they are comfortable and feel good when I wear them."
4.0,"I love this bag because of the detachable shoulder strap, I purposefully chose this one because I‚Äôd hoped the bottom would hold the bag off the ground and I wouldn‚Äôt get holes.  Well the straps across the bottom just wick up any rain and everything in my bag gets wet sitting on the stadium floor.  I have to pack my bag with things in ziploc bags to keep them dry.  Some make a seamless bottomed bag so those of us in open stadiums can keep our belongings dry!"
4.0,it's so soft and comfy! The light color is sort of transparent though
4.0,"Really cute, just big in the midsection"
4.0,"Material is pretty thin, but style is just like the picture"
4.0,"durable, works fine."
4.0,the length was perfect
4.0,I was looking around for a pretty cool pendant and I found this one. I thought it was a full skull but its not still dope though
4.0,I got this hat because of the cheap price but I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be all bald up in the Pkg so now it‚Äôs damage but what the heck It only cost me a few pennies
4.0,"So bright, summer colors, love the feel of this cover up. Looks just like the model is wearing in ad."
4.0,Great little wattle. A little difficult when I get a wad of bills but otherwise very nice to use. Love the color.
4.0,Very Very nice.
4.0,Great little key chain- cute and light
4.0,I like my feet are warm
4.0,"Good shirt, but unfortunately arrived with a large stain and it was too late to take it back. Good quality and design, just something to watch out for."
4.0,"The only reason I knew the polka dots were blue was because I looked at the picture with the magnifying glass feature. The skirt of the suit was shorter than I expected. The skirt also had a somewhat crude cut, but not enough to notice unless examined on closer look. I thought the cut might be a bit low, and it was. Overall, it mostly matched my expectations. It would be good if it was seen on a model for more perspective on the depth of the cut and the length of the skirt. I also would prefer an underwire, but I was aware that this suit did not have one before I bought it. Delivery was the next day."
4.0,"I bought the dress in pink. Its a beautiful dress, the material is alright, and it fit as expected. Reason for 4 star rating is because I had to sew the top back together because it was falling apart when i took it out of the bag. It was just a small area on top, near the buttons. No biggy, but when you buy something new, you dont expect to put in any work thats why i took off a star. Another downside is that the material outlines everything under the dress. In my case, it hella outlined my cellulite, but its nothing a good pair of spanx can't fix. üòâ"
4.0,Used on Christmas day to shovel show.  Kept my hands warm as promised.  Loved the pull on base of glove to help pull gloves on.  Buy one size bigger.
4.0,Great feel and light weight. Stretches a bit too easy
4.0,I love it I can‚Äôt wait to wear at my work place
4.0,I like these a lot. Wish the hook and eye area was wider. It is about 1 inch.  Love the colors.
4.0,"Fit as expected, I am 5'6&#34; and this dress just brushes on the floor in bare feet.  I wear a size 6/8 so I purchased a medium and it fits good although it could be a little smaller on the top, however, I am small up top so this would probably be perfect for who is a little more endowed.  Nice material and very comfortable."
4.0,Like the band. It looks nice and compliments my chosen watch face well.  It does loosen easily and starts to roll around on my wrist.
4.0,Very cool but you can c the spots of the design when you wear them.
4.0,"A little big, but still nice."
4.0,"This was a gift for my friend and she absolutely LOVED it! The product looked classy and worth more than I paid. Not sure how long it'll hold up esp. with other reviews complaining about my friend has yet to say anything bad about it. The only thing I was expecting and did not get (much to my disappointment) was some sort of small box or jewellery box for it to come in. When it delivers, all you get is the necklace on the paper depicted in the picture."
4.0,"I love it , it‚Äôs very comfortable my only complaint is that the inscription is hard to read. I purchased the silver ring."
4.0,"ACEPTABLE, PERO ESPERABA ALGO MEJOR EN CALIDAD"
4.0,I thought it be bugger for an extra large. It fits. Depends on how you want it to fit go up a size. Its comfortable material
4.0,good littile smaller face than i wanted but not bad
4.0,This necklace is just as described and shipped quicker than I anticipated.  The only thing I would change about it (and the reason I gave the product 4 stars) is the chain is very generic so I would suggest getting a better chain.
4.0,"I wish the skirt part was a little longer and I had to clip the bow to the headband, but it‚Äôs still cute and looks like the picture."
4.0,"In my opinion, the instruction booklets should be larger, with stronger print, and perhaps a little editing of the contents."
4.0,"The top part is very form fitting. But, the dress is comfortable and does not wrinkle or ride up. I am happy with it."
4.0,Love! Love! Love!!!!
4.0,"These are super small (length wise) and I'm 5' tall. I wouldn't wear these out, maybe as a costume or with leggings/stockings underneath. They are very cute though just tiny. I do love that it's elastic, goes on easy."
4.0,I ordered one size bigger (usually wear a Med but ordered a Large) because of other reviews.  The thing I didn‚Äôt expect is how short they are.  I‚Äôm tall so I like my shirts a little longer but these barely come to the waistline.  Otherwise decent quality.
4.0,Beautiful but the plastic backs were a disappointment
4.0,"My fit bit fits loosely in the band. I am actually kind of afraid of it falling out. If I tap the face of the fit bit, it comes out of the band."
4.0,Good but not coming with cover.
4.0,They are a bit bigger than she thought but they have been admired by her co workers. Vey pretty and fashionable and go with any style.
4.0,The bodice in this size was just too tight for a sort person.  I ordered this for a Christmas wedding in which I was asked to wear green.  Material was beautiful and perfect for occasion.
4.0,Cute and the price was right! Very hip for the fraction of the cost of expensive name brand.
4.0,Cute just too big
4.0,The fabric tears easily but I'm not using it as a normal shirt do it works fine as it is but if I wasn't I'd be very concerned.
4.0,"This is very well made with a beautiful, silky fabric"
4.0,I bought three more hats but in different colors and I like how the fit in your head.
4.0,I love these. Mainly because I prefer underwear without writing. The material is great and they fit so nice. The only downside is that they do roll up the thigh.
4.0,"This runs a little small, so order one a size larger.  Also, it has shoulder pads.. but they are totally removable.  I haven't removed my yet, so I am not sure if the shoulders are going to set right when I do.  However, the fabric is nice, and the design is clean and unique.  I like this, but probably wont wear it until I loose about 10lbs, which is a little disappointing."
4.0,Love the color and the magnetic band . . . and the price!!!
4.0,It was great! Not super heavy but worked for what I needed.
4.0,I love how soft the material is. It is good quality. The pants fit but the shirt is pretty snug.
4.0,"I was disappointed to see that this cool style was only available in one size, S-L. Since I take an XL in most clothing lines, I assumed this cute jumpsuit would not fit me. Reading an earlier reviewer's comment that the overalls run large, I decided to risk ordering them. To my surprise, they fit perfectly, despite my being a US size 14 and being 5'6&#34;. Also, there is quite a bit of spandex in them which gives the wearer some flexibility. I love the color, the hood, the zipper, and the pockets - all very fashionable. I am not a huge fan of the carefully constructed holes that are supposed to give the garment a distressed look. As another reviewer pointed out, this &#34;feature&#34; actually takes away from the overall quality of the garment (the holes are not readily apparent in the online photo, so finding them was sort of an unexpected shock.) I would give this five stars if the overalls didn't have these ridiculous looking holes (no matter how well tailored they might be.) Also, if a woman is very short and slim (a regular size small), these are going to be way too large. But, since they fit me and I like most of the features, this garment gets four stars."
4.0,"Lightweight clear, comparable to Maui Jim‚Äôs at a tremendous fraction of the price.  The lens‚Äô are a little small for my face, but I took a chance when ordering.  Will see how they hold up"
4.0,Needed the colors to accessorize a suit. It matched perfectly although not the best quality. It served the purpose and I'm grateful. I'm satisfied overall.
4.0,I like the fit for me. Way too small for my husband. Too hot for the summer even without a filter. I think it will be ok for winter. Really needs the metal nose part. A little pricey.
4.0,as above a little tight below the knee
4.0,So far so good. I did buy a size 10 normally a 8.5<br />Other than that very cute and comfy
4.0,I really like the color on this cardigan. The material is like spandex so if u don't like that then probably don't buy. I got it a 2xl and it's alittle smaller around the waist.
4.0,I would give them five stars but the stitching at the wrist is coming undone.
4.0,Very cute. Shipped very quick. Made in China which I would have preferred American made.  Bright color blue.  Quality is medium in my opinion. Not super cheap feeling but not high quality either.
4.0,"Cute dress, not flattering on my body type so unfortunately sent it back."
4.0,I wish that the band was longer in length.
4.0,Style/design is amazing got a lot of compliments. Fit was okay.  A little tight definitely recommend ordering one size larger than usual size
4.0,Fit well but too long.
4.0,"A little thicker than I thought they would be, different in the knee socks. The knee socks are thick but not too thick, these make my shoes feel tight. I won‚Äôt be buying these again"
4.0,It has a small knit other then that it fits prefect!
4.0,Cute charm but it changes color
4.0,But I loved the FABRIC
4.0,"Have not used it yet, but will on my upcoming trip. I would give it a five star, but I thought it had sleeves for Credit cards. It does not.<br />Will keep it though as I do like the overall size."
4.0,"Or looks as amazing in life as it does in the picture. It has plenty of string.  I'm a 2x and overall,  it fits great.  The black backing under the string isn't wide enough though. I'm getting some black fabric to glue on, but an exact match might be hard."
4.0,"This is a mid length dress and it has very stretchy fabric. I was worried that it might be too small because there were other reviews saying it fit small, but I had no issues with mine!"
4.0,Defiantly order a Size larger than you think. I have a bust and the dress fits but I have to have someone help me out of it. The fabric is nice and the Socks were a great touch.
4.0,Very comfortable and can dress it up or down.
4.0,We got this for my son for college. After sending a different one back on amazon we found this one. It's large and even thought the canvas is soft its thick and seems durable. All the straps seens well(and neatly) stitched He's only had it for a short amount of time but seems very happy with it. His only complaint is that the laptop sleeve is not separate from the backpack and is just a pocket.
4.0,Nice material and an overall good quality tank top. Only problem is they DO run small. I wear a medium but they fit too tightly. I'm afraid that after the first wash they will shrink to the point in which they won't fit anymore. I would recommend ordering a size up
4.0,"The top is short and tight, and the pants were so long I had to take them up. I am 5'7&#34; and usually like things longer, but these are too long."
4.0,Perfect except the waist band. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 115 and the waist band was very tight
4.0,Nice earrings. Just smaller than I thought.
4.0,rather large to carry in your purse but this size needed in order to use for the HD bifocal sunglasses
4.0,"Fun socks, just know they‚Äôre a little thin."
4.0,Beautiful shawl - using for a belly dance Spanish shawl fusion dance.  Love the color!
4.0,Nice quality but runs small.  Bought an XXL which fit like an XL.  Returned to merchant for refund.
4.0,"It‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful dress, but will be returning for a bigger size. I‚Äôm a 34C, 5ft, 130lbs athletic build. There‚Äôs no wiggle room and I‚Äôd like it to fit a little more loosely."
4.0,Loveeeeeeee these!!!! My husband is very pleased and bought me another pair in black. Only downfall is they run a good half size small but i normally wear a 9 and ordered a 9 but it's doable without looking crazy.
4.0,It's seams to be good quality and looks just like in the picture. I'm 5'7 100 lbs and it's a little to large for me.
4.0,The mans shirt was wider than expected but I like both tees. The mustaches is very visible and not washed out like I have seen on some shirts.
4.0,These are very tiny and delicate. Really beautiful!
4.0,I could not find Wraparounds locally that would fit.  I use these and like them a lot.
4.0,I love this dress I am 5‚Äô3 160 and have 34 DD boobs so I was concerned about the buttons. I ordered a large and it didn‚Äôt have and problems with the buttons and believe I could have gotten a medium even.
4.0,This is a pretty layered necklace! I like the star and moon design and the small stars on the smaller part of the necklace layer. Would make a nice gift because it comes in a pretty box and drawstring bag. It does look a little cheap and juvenile but it is still pretty. May be nice for a teenager or someone in their 20s.
4.0,Hat is way to big for my 3 yr old grand son but seems of good quality
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 135lbs. I usually wear a small. Because of reviews I order the M (Asia L) and they fit perfect. Snug, but not too tight. Very lightweight and comfortable. The quality seems good, I am just hoping they are durable."
4.0,Got these cuff links for my husband for my husband's birthday. They are perfect for his quirky personality! They came in a great box that presents them  beautifully while keeping them from scratching.  They are very sharp looking and the bar that turns to attach them to his shirts moves very smoothly making then easy to put on one handed. He absolutely loves them!  They make a great gift.  Pictures don't do then justice!.
4.0,Super cute sheer dress for pool or beach. I am very happy with my purchase.
4.0,It feels substantial and looks good while being a good value.
4.0,"Getting the garment on was not so difficult, and friends did compliment my posture during the day. However, removing the garment at night was very difficult as i currently have a frozen shoulder. Unfortunately I will have to wait till it gets better before using the garment again."
4.0,"The watch is very pretty...I would have loved it except that it was made for a BIG wrist.  I have a 6"" wrist and so it literally fell upside down on my arm due to the weight of the face of watch.  I returned it."
4.0,"My daughter wanted this and it is great for the price! She thinks it's a little big, since she is petite, but very nice quality!"
4.0,I am tall and prefer my tops to go at least to my hips. This is a nice top for an average height or shorter woman.
4.0,Very nice. My grand daughter loves them. Same Ariel as in Emoj game.
4.0,"As others have stated, I am not exactly sure of the brand; however, I will say, they appear to be decent shorts for the price. They seem to be made of decent materials and have decent stitching (I have not washed them yet).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I put them on is how comfortable they are! They really do feel as if you‚Äôre wearing a pair of lounge pants. The second thing I noticed is that the length and the fit were just right; they were not too long nor were they too lose. I‚Äôm a shorter guy (5‚Äô9‚Äù) on the stocky side (upper 200‚Äôs lbs), by the way.<br /><br />I tried them on with a couple of different shirts and a couple of pairs of shoes and, I will say, they seem to be somewhat versatile depending on what you pair them with. Overall, I feel as if they are great shorts for the summer."
4.0,Overall I love this jacket! The green is a very nice olive color. The style is great too. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because there is a very strong odor. I hope washing it will take the smell away.
4.0,"First Id like to say the Ring is pretty the design is nice but the copper on the inside of the ring isn't real and you can tell that by the green stain you get on your finger when it gets wet, the bag looked nothing like the one in the picture but more like a cheap little see through bag with an elephant on it not the bag in the description the ring is painted copper."
4.0,Fits nice and doesn‚Äôt turn color
4.0,I like it. Very Chic.
4.0,"Really like everything about this except that it's a little large. I'm 5 6 and 140lbs. The midsection is huge! But, it's comfortable and cute!"
4.0,"I like the Velcro, stays attached to your bra, wish they were a little less thick, but I‚Äôm enjoying"
4.0,The product was overall good. Material was soft.  Just didn't add much length though.
4.0,pretty and affordable
4.0,Comfortable yet sexy. Glad I purchased it. I would have gotten a small next time.
4.0,It was a little shorter then I would have thought. Other then that it was a nice costume.
4.0,"Nice thick socks , but its a workout to get them on , way to snug on the calf and the feet."
4.0,I returned this item.  Very nice dress but the small fit like a large.  Loved that it had pockets wish I could have kept it
4.0,Love the material is very sexy gave it away might get another one bigger size may be 2 size up recommend
4.0,"As I am writing this review, there are only two current reviews on these sunglasses. One reviewer gave the product 5 stars and the other reviewer gave the product 3 stars. I am in the middle with 4 stars. I want to make a comment about something that the 3-star reviewer said. Karsten commented, ""What I don't like about these glasses is the small inner frame which restricts your sideways view. I don't know the purpose of it, but it annoys the crap out of me and is the reason I deducted stars in this review. The inner frame also gets in the way when you want to clean the glasses from the inside."" Also stated was the fact the manufacturer needed to supply instructions with the product. There is also a lack of information on the Amazon website. However, after looking at ads for similar products, I realized that one can install prescription lenses into the inner frame. The website describes how the color lenses can be replace, but not how the inner frame can be removed. However, it can be removed by rotating it upward and pulling it away from the main frame. I was a little hesitant at first because it does take some force, but I did remove it successfully without breaking it. The colored lenses are quick and easy to remove and install.<br /><br />I had obtained 3 pairs of sunglasses from different sellers to see which one I would like best to wear while skiing, when I wasn't wearing ski goggles. Of the three, these sunglasses fit the best under my helmet. I have already tested and reviewed the other pairs of sunglasses. Although these sunglasses are the most comfortable and very stylish, I feel that they are a little too flimsy to use under my ski helmet. So I will same them for the summer and use them while bike riding.<br /><br />One additional comment - I found that sellers of very similar sunglasses provided information on the different lenses. I didn't find any such information from this seller."
4.0,Keeps my fingers from burning
4.0,"Very good shoes, and light to boot."
4.0,El material es muy sensible
4.0,This shirt is super cute! Material is soft and the colors are true to what you see online!
4.0,"These are such cute, dainty earrings. Perfect for every day running around.<br /><br /> They are smaller than I thought, but the stone are also clearer than I thought. The stud portion is A silver Metal, but the cup that holds the stone is gold. My ears are a little sensitive so I can only wear earrings for a few hours. These are no exceptions, I do have to take them out after an afternoon of wearing. They came with a second pair of backs too."
4.0,It was great until I decided I was a hair stylist and cut it. It was a botch job. Wish they had a nice short white wig. Cause there was no fixing that.
4.0,Often times these ear cuffs are too small and don't fit right. This was perfect for the price and is easily adjustable.
4.0,really like the shirt for going out when its cold but I would size up one if you want the flow look
4.0,These are super cute. For the price they‚Äôre GREAT. They‚Äôre a little heavy and seem pretty sturdy.
4.0,It's a beautiful dress. The sequins are glued on well and the dress is very soft. It is long so I'll have to hem it but I am short. üòä However it smells really bad. It probably is because of the glue but it isn't something that airing out won't fix.
4.0,"This coat arrived on time and was exactly as described. The fit was true to size and it appears to be well stitched. The fabric does appear to wrinkle easily, though, if not properly folded or hung up carefully. I like the style and color and it‚Äôs is a nice jacket for moderate winter weather. It might be a bit light for the really cold snaps like we have experienced lately, but this type of severe cold weather is unusual.  It would also serve well in late fall and early spring as well."
4.0,Cheap but what more would you expect for that price.  I'm in my 30s and still wear this. It may be time to reevaluate my life choices.
4.0,Cute and well made but would be nice if sleeves had elastic around the wrists and the bottom had a drawstring cord.
4.0,"Pretty shirt, good quality. Didn't look great on me but looks exactly as pictured."
4.0,"Listen up, I'm on the chubby-tall side. 5'8<br />And this cosplay BARELY fit me. If you're a US size in 14-16, expect it to fit. However, I wouldn't encourage my plus sized friends to try if your bust is bigger than 50cm.<br />My friend also bought it and sadly, they couldn't get the shirt in.<br />Pros: this is a great fast convenient way to cosplay any of your genshin impact mains. ‚ô° I love it. I JUST WISH THEY HAD SOME BIGGER SIZES FOR ALL THE FANS.<br />But this cosplay is a hit!!! I'll be looking forward to shop again. Shipping was FAST."
4.0,"Cute, but too small!"
4.0,Great hat for the cold. Though it is a pretty tight fit even after wearing it for a few months.
4.0,"The costume looked amazing, my<br />Daughter loved it.  Back end near zipper tire easily and I had to hand stitch it closed again after one wear."
4.0,It fit just fine.  Good quality piece.
4.0,Fits like an over sized baggy dress. Top half fits nicely like similar top I have but waist down I'd shapeless and baggy I am trying to get it tapered. It's shapeless
4.0,"I loved the original Levis 505. I was one of those extremely upset when Levi's changed the cut while retaining the original name. I've since switched to Wrangler regular fit, straight, which is the closest thing I've found to the original 505. Just a little background on what kind of jeans I like to wear.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant when I unpacked this pair of jeans. The legs are skinnier and slightly stretchy, and I wasn't sure how it would feel. When I put it on, however, I was surprised by how comfortable they felt. It feels soft and comfortable, and it stretches easily. Another reviewer said it looks like jeans but feels like sweat pants. I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but it does give an idea of what it's like.<br /><br />While this has a regular rise, the waist seems looser than what the size indicates, probably because of the elasticity. If you're not a fan of low hanging jeans, I highly recommend a belt.<br /><br />I can't rate this regarding long term wear yet, obviously. But by its nature, it won't be as rugged as denim. But they don't look fragile by any means. Stitching looks decently done, and by weight they feel almost the same weight as a pair of denim jeans.<br /><br />Amazon has not listed the price yet, so I'm unable to rate this fairly. After wearing it a couple of times, I really like them, but whether they will get a 5 star rating from me ultimately depends on the price. If it's reasonable, I will most likely buy 1 or 2 more pairs."
4.0,"I bought these to wear with a couple pair of my Pleaser shoes that are slip on. Sometimes, like if going dancing, having your feet more secure in the shoe is desirable.  These are perfect, and what a fabulous idea!"
4.0,"I used this for a Rapunzel disneybound, and it looks awesome! It‚Äôs so much nicer looking than I expected for the price. I got compliments on it! I‚Äôm only deducting a star because at the end of the day, I had green marks on my neck from the allergic reaction to the alloy."
4.0,It worth the price
4.0,"It's a little difficult to put on and get it on perfectly but it does the job and didn't fall off once. I wore it at my bachelorette party and despite my sweaty drunkenness, it stayed on all night!"
4.0,"Nice looking jacket, but I expected it to be a synthetic fabric, not cotton &#34;sweatshirt&#34; fabric. I worry about it fading in the wash. If the website posted the type of fabric it was made of, I did not see it."
4.0,Very pleased with the fit and the price.
4.0,Looks ok.  But the emblem is just vinyl.
4.0,Decent dress. Looks good.
4.0,"These are nice for the price,  they haven't broken yet"
4.0,"Absolutely love this purse!  It did have a very funky smell when it first arrived, but that left within a week.  The pockets are roomy and it looks very  high end for the price I paid for it.  I get complimented on it every day!"
4.0,Great quality Angel wings.
4.0,It was actually more off-white
4.0,was a little bigger in the waste but overall great dress
4.0,Its cute i like it
4.0,It's for a Halloween costume.
4.0,This is perfect for carry on travel.  Good quality.
4.0,Love it just arrived super wrinkled. Got it for a cactus theme wedding that we are going to. You will love it!!
4.0,"This hat is petite and adorable. I noticed that the feather does not stand up, as it appears to be on the photo.  I will need to tweak that, but other than that minor problem, this hat is a winner."
4.0,Excellent shirt and is what I expected
4.0,"I love these pants but being a shorter person with bigger hips (5'1'', 37'') I got a small and the leggings come down to just above my ankles. The length issue is something I have with almost all 'capri' length leggings so it's not just this brand, but this cut is wider at the bottom so they kind of float an inch or so off of my ankle at it looks a little odd. So I just fold it up to just under the knee and it's fine. The fabric quality is thick and never see through and it's high on the waist which I like. As pictured the waist really does come up to your belly button."
4.0,A little jumbled up and you need someone else to put it on but it's groovy.
4.0,A little small but I'm satisfied
4.0,bought for my teen granddaughter who plays the cello.  She was pleased.
4.0,Of course I wanted to Marc Jacobs but we are in a budget and it pulls off well. The strap has metal and is adjustable. It looks small but holds everything I need. It's awesome
4.0,"They are a little shiny. They are like thick panty hose, which was disappointing. I ordered some (printed) leggings from the same vendor in the fall and they are super soft, like a stretchy cotton spandex blend. That's what I was expecting. These are like a nylon spandex blend. There is a noticeable sheen to them, so I think that will limit where I wear them."
4.0,Good product quality for the price. Very nice looks. Not for everyday use but as part of a collection to wear a piece that looks good every once in a while
4.0,"I liked that it fit so great on me, im 5‚Äô3‚Äù..though I expected it to be near my mid thigh, not knee. More for professional use"
4.0,"This shows alot of cleavage, your bra will probably be partially in view. Strangers passing me even said ""cute dress"" and ""you look so pretty"". I'm 5'7"" and about 220 and XXL is comfy. Probably be better fit with XL<br />Good deal so far"
4.0,"Nice pair of shorts. They are sized right for my XXL frame, are very comfortable and suitable for most of my outdoor recreation activities."
4.0,Identical to original but expensive for what it is. I  would have bought alternative but I couldn't find one I was sure would fit.
4.0,Absolutely love this dress and will buy again.  Just be aware that the dress runs small so buy the next size up.
4.0,Well made but wish it was a wee smaller.
4.0,i had to return it cause it runs super small but its good quality and nice
4.0,Good quality just got up a size for more room
4.0,"My kids really enjoy these slugs, but within the first 10 minutes of them having them all of the eyes were gone. Other than the eyes, they are fun to stick to windows, bend them in half and stick the suction cups together, or just holding them and ""popping"" them."
4.0,"Like, but runs a little small - my granddaughter is two but she wears a size 4-5. Purchased 4-5 bottom fits fine but top is a little small."
4.0,it's OK as a work watch when your doing physical work. You won't care if it breaks.
4.0,Fun mask. I little hard to breath but OK for short wear.
4.0,Grand son loves his shirt
4.0,"Nice and comfy, though they pill badly.  I just use a sweater shaver on them because they are cute and feel great."
4.0,"I love the fact it‚Äôs an iconic watch for under 10 dollars. It‚Äôs fairly simple to set the watch, this is my first digital watch I bought as a ‚Äúbeater‚Äù and I‚Äôve always avoided them for some reason but I‚Äôm glad I pulled the trigger on it. It is a tad small for my liking but I think that adds to the charm of it. Band is very comfortable and watch is very lightweight. You can‚Äôt go wrong. I would have given 5 stars had the light been a bit brighter but hey, again, $10"
4.0,"These are great, they sit a little lower than I thought and touch my cheeks, but I can fix that."
4.0,Good Value for money.  Bought it for my teenage son.
4.0,A great corset. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs more turquoise than royal blue as pictured. A great buy for the price though.
4.0,"This robe is extremely soft and comfy, but I do believe the sizing is written incorrectly on the item description.  I initially ordered an L(7-9), but it arrived extremely big for my size 8 daughter.  So I returned it and got a M(4-6) and it's what I would expect for her size, but she certainly wouldn't normally fit in a 4-6 size anything.  The reviews were mixed but from my personal experience it's clear the sizing should instead be a M(7-9) and a L(10-12).  My daughter has never had an L in anything so I honestly think the description is just misstated (the tags on the robes only state M or L).  But we do love the robe, it's so very soft and comfy, so if it fits I do recommend it!"
4.0,"Very cute.  A little on the small side.  My 16 mos old, who is about at the 25% in growth will probably be too big for these pajamas before he hits 18 mos.  they are supposed to fit snug, but not so snug that they are constricting, so they're okay now, but probably not for much longer."
4.0,They don't come with backs to them but otherwise very cute.
4.0,"I‚Äôm a size 14-16, and got the XL, which does fit fine, but i have to wear a tank underneath, as it‚Äôs kind of cropped, and my belly would stick out unattractively.<br /><br />I should have known honestly. Things with ribbons are a nightmare, so these will have to be modified. I intend to replace them with black shoelaces. The body ribbons that i tied bows into, kept coming open. The arms are WAY too long for me, so i had to fold the sleeves up out of the way, and I‚Äôm not sure how to modify the ends of the sleeves, to keep the points, but i will definitely be removing the ribbons, and possibly sewing the pointed ends together. Even without the ribbons, the points hang over the ends of my fingers.<br /><br />The material is very lightweight - I‚Äôd expected a lightweight sweatshirt type of material, but this is thin, polyester material. It does look good on though, and I‚Äôm a fan of the ribbony tied parts, just not the actual ribbons themselves - and I envision them getting tangled up in the wash anyway. It‚Äôs definitely very pretty, just not that practical, but I‚Äôm not willing to give up on it yet, because i like how it looks on my body.<br /><br />It could be improved on, with a couple of tweaks (materials used) and if that were the case, I‚Äôd get the other colours too."
4.0,The first pair of Discovery Capri Size 8 I purchased fit great so I decided to order another pair.  This new pair is the same size but it is somewhat smaller.  I think the company has cut the size smaller because it does not fit as well.
4.0,Love this band but be careful because the screws come loose.
4.0,"These sunglasses look great! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I can't tell how great the Polarized lenses is, like I'm looking at my phone screen right now and normally when you have polarized lenses on you can barely look at your screen but I'm having no issues right now.  These sunglasses are a little smaller than I thought compared to the other reviews but they're really similar to the ray ban club masters size. Overall for the price these are good sunglasses, I wasn't anticipated high quality, I feel like these might break in a month or two but I'll get my money worth.<br /><br />I got these at a discount for my unbias, honest review."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! I‚Äôm a bigger girl, so I ordered an XL. The top part of the dress fits well but the bottom of the dress was a little tight and wasn‚Äôt very giving/stretchy. Gorgeous dress, but I have to return because I want a little more comfort with my thighs/stomach area."
4.0,Classy and conservative!
4.0,I would give it five stars for value and cuteness factor - perfect for its' intended recipient - but received much more slowly than I had anticipated.
4.0,"I thought it was for kids with a locking back/screw in back, but it isn't. So it'll be a whole before she can wear it. It is very pretty though!"
4.0,These are comfortable and fit nice. They have a real nice elastic waistband. It is wide enough that it does not cut into your hips like some styles do.
4.0,"Not perfect but I am keeping these boots.  They are cut pretty narrow so don't suggest if you have a wider foot, and they are a bit peculiar in the shaft height - they hit high enough on the ankle that flexing the foot to drive and walk creates a bit of friction.  I'll choose socks carefully to avoid rubbing.  On the plus side, the heel is really nicely shaped and these look great with flares and boot cut pants."
4.0,I love the look of the glasses! My only complaint is the magnified area is VERY small in the lens so I really have to look down awkwardly to see out of it.
4.0,"I loved this. The only thing that annoys me is that there is ""I love you mom"" on the back. Which, this wouldn't be a problem if it's for your mom, but I don't think your girlfriend would appreciate it too much."
4.0,I measured my son's foot and used the sizing chart but they still fit too snug. Had to return and get the next size up.
4.0,Daughter loves these warm and soft gloves!
4.0,Comfortable has a side pocket
4.0,"Only paid $5.00 for these and I wear them often.  Because I am short, the pant legs fall down over the cuffs. Not a problem.  There is no label in the waist, so you have to eyeball the waist panel to see which is front and which is the back. Not any big deal.<br /><br />The pants are comfy and wash well.  Nice to wear around the house."
4.0,this is a lovely dress I have been losing weight lately and it fits just great. I decided to keep this one.
4.0,Very nice mask. Looking forward to wearing.
4.0,For what I paid not bad. I've gotten a lot of complements. Like it a lot.  I hope it doesn't tarnish.
4.0,very comfortable and I can wear for interviews with my Dansko clogs.<br />The seem at the toe is thicker than other brands.
4.0,Decent sunglasses at a very competitive price.  Delivered on time and exactly as described by provider.
4.0,I work outdoors and wanted to keep the sun off my arms. These are nice but wish they were a little looser.
4.0,Beautiful color and fiit
4.0,"Shipped in about 6 days (from Tel Aviv).  Almost a pound in weight, but doesn't feel like it.  Looks more expensive than $329, but is sporty as well.  Rugged and well put together.  Sapphire face doesn't scratch easily.  Crown buttons and band are durable.  Clasp is pretty basic, but functional.  Chrono function works good, day and date are accurate, if not the easiest to read.  Manual is a bit vague, but what you need is in there.<br /><br />Had a single link removed for sizing @ local jewelery store, no problem.<br /><br />Not as blue as the picture shows (both here & on Sector's site), more of a darker (though still glossy) blue under the crystal.<br /><br />Would buy from Amazon/WWRETAILERS LTD again."
4.0,Its very light... But the band is very thin . the watch face is beautiful thou
4.0,"I really like the texture, it feels like it won't slide on a table easily. It fits my S4 nicely. Very slim fit and comfortable in my hand."
4.0,It is a very good dress for the price. The bows at the sleeves are only sewed on by a single stitch so I don‚Äôt expect them to stay on long. That the only complaint I have. Was a bit loose but didn‚Äôt look baggy so I say it fit well just runs a bit big.
4.0,"Very good deal. The band seems to be more pliable than the original band, but looks very similar.  I've had mine about six weeks and it still looks brand new!"
4.0,"I was expecting a much brighter green color, but it looks more like teal. Would have been perfect if the color looks like the pictures. Overall, the quality seems very good and I like the texture as well. I had to punch another hole since my wrist is tiny."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1618012719416bf0b5de96a0d66dfe17]]
4.0,The dress was beautiful but to big. I followed the sizing chart and bought the medium. After trying it on the strings on the back were to big.
4.0,"Very cute and inexpensive, but did not work, will have to try and get my own battery for it.  That's a little disappointing."
4.0,Looked exactly as described and fits comfortably will buy again.
4.0,This swimsuit is very cute! It fits as expected too... I actually ordered up and shouldn't have so I'm exchanging for my right size. The material is soft and looks great for the price.
4.0,"The quality of the pullover is good. Looks just like the picture. This pullover is available in one size only. It stretches well so no issues with the fit but lengthwise I think it will fit petites only. For reference,I am petite, 5'2 and 120lbs and it hit just 2-3inches below the navel. Steal for the price."
4.0,"Very cute. I‚Äôm 125 lb and got a size M. Fits perfect. It‚Äôs not made of heavy fabric, so don‚Äôt expect a ‚Äúreally dress.‚Äù It‚Äôs light fabric but sturdy enough to wear around during Halloween."
4.0,"Had a problem with the belt, seller replaced it. But the new one had the same problem. 4 stars for trying. Thanks"
4.0,"I was so excited to get this dress. As expected, it is ADORABLE. Absolutely satisfied with the look of the dress. HOWEVER, it's extremely short. I am 5'8' and there's no way I could bend over in this dress without shorts. I got a large and the fit around the arms, shoulders,  and bust are great. I love how flowy the dress is. Also, MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT THE SELLER BEFORE PURCHASING. Make sure it says the seller is Joteisy. There are fake sellers for some of the dress colors."
4.0,I can't seem ot get them to work well for me.
4.0,Very comfortable! I bought for a costume but I will definitely use as a regular dress. Good price.
4.0,Light almost cant tell i have it on
4.0,Nice socks.. Good quality ... My son loves them!
4.0,These are very comfortable slippers and great to wear around the house.
4.0,Nice and sturdy belt.  But you'll need to purchase extra keepers.  The one provided are sewn together and last a week of running a belt thru.
4.0,Bought it to replace the original leather band of my Braun watch. Happy with it.
4.0,"The purple color is lovely, but it was about a size too small (especially in the arms and waist). I looked at the size chart they specified, but should have gone a size up because the material isn't very stretchy. It is padded enough to wear without a bra."
4.0,This is a roomy kaftan that I can wear as a swimsuit cover or on its on. It is more than enough room for me. The bust area is 62 inches. That gives you an idea of how big it is. The print is colorful and it is also comfortable.
4.0,"These aren‚Äôt as flexible as the original band, but they do the job and are fairly comfortable. The main shortcoming is that the strap tends to come out of the keeper more often than with the stock strap."
4.0,very nice .  color of stone muted. Not the same as the pictured
4.0,Not as long as I'd expected and the fit is a tad tight. They work well for a variety of costumes.
4.0,"I like this, it is as expected."
4.0,I ordered these earrings for a very young child.  They worked out great.  The quality is superb..very dainty!  And they sparkle beautifully!
4.0,"My usual size is extra small, and the small is a bit too big in the waist and lot too big in the sleeves on me so I'm returning it.<br /><br />That said: the fabric is lovely and soft, and it was only a little wrinkled from being folded up in the package, which is a plus. I am 5'8&#34; and it comes to the bottom of my kneecaps.<br /><br />I got it in green and if I were to keep and wear it, I suspect I would feel like I was stealth-cosplaying Anna of Arendelle, for what it's worth."
4.0,Looks very nice and awesome<br />But the clip is not working properly.
4.0,"A friend bought this for me as a gift. The detail in the shirt is amazing, and it's very soft. However, I will say that I wear a medium, which is the size I got, and while the torso portion fits perfectly, the sleeves themselves are a little small. I'm female, and the sleeves feel tight around my bicepts (though the material is stretchy, so it isn't uncomfortable or anything). I'd suggest buying one size up, if you're buying this for a male.<br /><br />The only other critique I have is that there is actually a typo on the design. Around the ribcage there are these straps that are clearly meant to read &#34;Reaper&#34; except, whoever did the design typoed.. So it says &#34;Rearer&#34;.. Or just &#34;rear.&#34; Hilarious for a short laugh though I would advise the company fixes the typo, because it's on both sides of the design."
4.0,My daughter loves the color off the coat. The inside is nice and soft. Only thing she does not like is the zipper. Not such a good quality zipper. Feels like you can easily break it
4.0,Use this product as an undershirt or as a tank top. It fits really nice and isn‚Äôt uncomfortable at all.
4.0,Overall these were a good buy. I probably should have gotten a small over a medium but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Will probably get more colors.
4.0,good strong clip. I use mine for keys.
4.0,They are a little bigger and heavier than I expected.  Do have concerns they may drop off my ear.  Will need to be careful not to lose one.  They are well made and look great.
4.0,"OK im going to leave a review that I would like to read when I'm shopping here:<br />Height: 5' 2.5&#34;<br />Bust: 35&#34;<br />Waist: 27.5&#34;<br />Hips: 40&#34;<br />Weight: 140lbs<br />Size ordered: S<br />I'm very busty (32DDD or 34DD bra size) and more hippy than anything else down bottom. With that being, said I love this dress! I was a little resistant to order it because I am so busty and the off-the-shoulder thing concerned me. But you do have options in the placement of the straps. There is padding built into the bust area. But for some reason it works! I don't really have to wear a bra with it because the padding works so well with the dress.<br /><br />It's stretchy and comfortable. Intending on wearing it for a ball and think it'll be elegant but stylish enough for what I need. Highly suggest ordering this one!"
4.0,Loved the outfit! Fit great till I washed it. The shirt shrunk but the pants didn't. I gave 4 cause I can still wear my pants which I love. But I had to give my daughter the sweater.
4.0,it's a beautiful bracelet and fits great. the only concern i have is that beads are strung too tight and bracelet is rigid
4.0,A little see through. Thin material but really cute.
4.0,Liked the product. Little thin but very soft.
4.0,"I love to work out and still look cute!<br />I love this Sports bra, the design of the straps are different than usual and they make it so cute to wear. They go up and then down the middle of your back so its super cute with and off the shoulder shirt or scoop neck t-shirt. There are some different colors, I went with the classic black, because its always good to have black. I like the shape of the coverage as well, goes around the whole way and keeps everything in place. I would say the sizes ran a little small so I would plan that when buying yours.<br />Even though the straps are different and just a strap I felt fully supported when I was working out. The material(a kind of spandex) was nice as well, washed easily and was comfortable to wear. With the material is was stretchy so didn't feel like I couldn't breath but still supportive enough to work out in.<br />Overall I love my cute and comfy new sports bra."
4.0,love these pants needed desparately fast after unexpected accident so I kept even thouhh right leg had some wierd orangey-brown streaks which look like fron bleach better quality control please
4.0,This belt is too big for me.  I need to pin or sew it for it to fit better.  I have a smallish waist.  But it's a nice belt so I'll keep it.
4.0,The only thing that I thought it can close by zipper which is very disappointing
4.0,"Followed size chart, and it fit perfect. You'll have to order a lot bigger then you're used to buying in the US, so make sure you use a tape measure first before you order, and then use the size chart for exact size in this skirt. Can't go wrong then.<br />Good material. Arrived when expected. Can't complain. Don't know how it holds up in the long run yet since I haven't washed it a bunch yet, but everything else was great. :)"
4.0,Poles as expected. Lightweight and very strong. Don't have tent/shelter that uses trekking poles yet for setup but am confident these will work well. Locking mechanism very secure. Just be sure to check tension of quick locks when unpacking.
4.0,I shine my own shoes & find it relaxing.  Shine them up but without Sole & Heel polish job is not s little bottle goes a long way and makes shoes look great.  Just adds a wonderful finishing touch
4.0,Super cute. A little small.
4.0,"For the price I paid, these pants are pretty decent. They're a little loose and long on me (which I expected, since the smallest size available was medium), so I have to actually use the tie at the waist (which is not my preference). However, I wanted something cheap that was lighter and looser than my other indoor pants (black leggings) to wear around the house as the weather turns warm. Another reviewer compared the material to a t-shirt, and it's certainly thin, though more stretchy than the Ts I wear. In fact, these pants stretch and become even looser after I wear them for a few days, but they shrink back down in the wash. They're comfortable, cool enough for warm weather, and fit my budget. I wouldn't mind having another pair ‚Äî but that's not in the budget."
4.0,I love this sweatshirt but just be aware the collar is much higher than expected but is not a problem
4.0,"the dress is a tad long, but for the price it's cute"
4.0,I like that the cz stones do not go all the way around the back of the ring. This ring is very thin but definitely worth the money.
4.0,"Really cute, but the back is all lace and see thru."
4.0,"Good quality material and construction. Slim-Fit holds cards tightly and secure ... a little too tight. If it was 10% larger, fit would be perfect."
4.0,"Sent it back, not right for my 14 year old."
4.0,I like the style but found the material to be thinner than expected.
4.0,"Pretty, just a little bit small"
4.0,It's nice but runs small i had to give it away but the dress is really nice
4.0,I love the pants! My only complaint is the crotch area is very very baggy in a weird way.
4.0,"Fitted as expected, but  was way too long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 so if you are around this height it will need to be altered."
4.0,"Cool dress.  Bought it as part of a witch costume.  Runs a bit small, especially in the waist, in my opinion.  But its well made.  Had a blast in it and it lasted through a long Halloween party.  Could definitely wear for another occasion as a regular dress, with the right accessories.  Got a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"nice size, durable with lots of pockets"
4.0,Socks are so comfortable except at the top  of the leg is tight. So close to being 5 stars.
4.0,"I think this is a fun and funky summer skirt you can wear as a base for a wide range of casual summer outfits.<br />Another, older family member considers it too short and believes its quirky construction makes it look cheap and poorly made.<br /><br />Basically, if you like the look of this skirt in photos, you will probably be really happy with it.<br />The sizing feels spot on to me, the person who wears the skirt.<br />Also, despite the unfinished, uneven hems, purposefully created distress, and unusual details (example, back pockets are finished with mismatched rivets), the denim material and seams are all good quality.<br />The denim also has some stretch to it, which makes it very comfortable to move in.<br />Care is also standard for jeans, machine wash cold, tumble dry low; country of origin is China.<br /><br />Whether or not this is the right skirt for you all comes down to your own personal style.<br />If you do like the look of it, you will be getting something that is perfect for casual summer outfits (you could probably extend it into fall and spring by adding leggings), a little bit unique, comfortable, requires only basic care, decent quality, and easy to match to tops, as well as accessories."
4.0,"As a sweater it's great it genuinely does a good job of keeping you warm(and looking pretty cool while doing it) but it has the two issues I always have with sweaters. One the zipper gets stuck easily, but thankfully it's high quality enough so that I dont have to worry much about it getting permanently kinked or broken anytime soon. But the second and biggest complaint I have is that darn flexible bottom section it has that i always hate on sweaters because it always rides up so easily, I knew this would be an issue too that's why I bought it one size bigger( I'm xl). So If I did buy it my size that would mean the sweater would be basically unwearable.<br /><br />It's still a great sweater though, and if you're a small averaged size guy it would be no problem for you, I love the look of the sweater too very unique designs and it's quite the conversation starter. So, I recommend it f you want a nice looking warm sweater and dont mind being a bit uncomfortable. Unless of course again you're a smaller guy in which case it probably won't be an issue."
4.0,bought these for the kids for an air-show. should have gotten some adult ones for myself. These worked great. The sound dampening seemed to be enough that the kids were not even startled when an F/A-18 shot past us from behind.
4.0,Really like this.........will be great when I wear a tanktop.  Very thin material.......lightweight and will pack well for a trip
4.0,I got so many compliments on this over shirt. It is very soft and comfy enough to wear as a housecoat. I'm a big girl and was releaved that it fit. But the shoulders were a little tight while big everywhere else. Seems shoulders would be bigger since it'd be worn over another shirt.
4.0,Good quality but seems to be junior sizes.
4.0,It's definitely a cute swim suit but I was expecting it to fit a little looser like on the model in the pictures. I got a large and it's not super tight but it's form fitting for sure. I probably should've ordered an XL to achieve the loose fitting look. I'm a size 14 in bottoms and usually wear size large tops.
4.0,"My niece is an anime fan and watched Demon Slayer at the movies. She wanted to dress up as Nezuko for Halloween so this costume was ordered last minute. Like other reviewers stated, no keychain included. We ordered size 140 as the 130 was unavailable. It fits her just fine lengthwise, however, the belt was way too big even at the smallest setting and had to be adjusted with store bought Velcro strips. My niece is tiny due to radiation near her pituitary gland which affected her growth and is 4‚Äô5‚Äù and weighs about 65 pounds. We also bought her the wig to complete her outfit - Kamado Nezuko Cosplay Wig for Demon Slayer, Anime... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097MC4QSD/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glt_fabc_J5H6MPC6RT7TKNEBT9JS?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1. There are some unsightly strings sticking out and the bamboo mouth piece lacks depth, but for the price it‚Äôs worth it."
4.0,A bit more snug than anticipated but still fit okay. Used for running and working out primarily so they are a good deal.
4.0,Great look. Stays put for yoga without tugging.
4.0,"It runs because the fabric is poor in quality, I do not recommend it"
4.0,These are very pretty and warm.  Our 5 year old wants a pink pair too.  The only draw back is the ones we order had the decorative bead and it came off right away.  Not a big deal...unless you are 5. ;)
4.0,"Love how slim this watch is. This low profile fits under work gloves.<br />My work requires moving assorted boxes of varying weights and sometimes they are resting on my wrist, which means it is also resting on the watch. So far so good.<br />Con: The built in light can barely light the fist digit of the time. Good thing I don't really need this feature.<br />Pro: Great price"
4.0,"My grand daughters said they liked the comfort,thickness and stretch."
4.0,"These are lovely, comfy shorts but they run huge and are kind of long between the legs. I'm tall and they cover my butt, which is nice. And the material is soft like butter. I ordered a 2XL and could have gotten a large!"
4.0,5'4&#34; - 120 lbs - 32/34A and a small fit okay. Little tight in the tummy but still cute. Didn't get 5 stars because the seam was broken.. It's an easy fix but still made it so I couldn't wear the dress that night.
4.0,"Ordered these because I need to replace my exiting grey ones. Ordered the S, which is the size of my other ones but in another brand and it was to snug around the hips but fit great everywhere else. Returned as a size up was needed for me.  (5-6, 145lbs)"
4.0,Great lunch box.  Only wish it had a separate compartment for cold items
4.0,"Good shoes, but keep in mind that these shoes will stretch as you play.<br />Buy a size small that is tight fitting."
4.0,Good price and fit nicely but make note - these are leggings that feel more like tights than cotton leggings. Are almost see-through and very thin.
4.0,relatively easy to use for a quick and affordable merch idea!
4.0,Nice tee shirt.
4.0,"The finish on the case is very nice. The ""action"" of the lid as it opens and closes is fantastic, feels very solid. The interior felt lining is also very nice. I really only have one minor complaint: The case will only hold pens that are 6"" or less in length. My S&W Tactical is 6 1/4"" long and won't fit."
4.0,I LOVE the way this looks on....but the lace at the neckline is scratchy. I will only wear this when I know I won't be wearing it very long
4.0,"Great pack regardless of the price.  I thought that it was going to be bigger, but I am not disappointed.  It will serve my purposes well for weekend backpacking and day hiking. The materials seem to be of decent quality.  I am 6 ft 3 in and find it to be adjustable enough to be comfortable.  There are plenty of pockets for storing and organizing gear. So far I haven't carried it more than 3 miles and have not loaded it with more than 30 pounds, but it feels like it will hold up well to 40+  pounds of equipment and multiple days of hiking."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings. Long enough for me to thread through both my holes, looks really pretty. Silver is not super shiny, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure if it‚Äôs sterling. But they‚Äôre lovely anyway so I‚Äôm keeping them."
4.0,Sooooo soft and comfy!
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Arrived a day early.
4.0,"These socks fit well, launder well with only a small amount of shrinkage and no fading. The elastic top band doesn‚Äôt get too tight. They are a bit thinner than I would have liked. Recommend to anyone liking novelty socks."
4.0,I am not happy with the craftmanship of product<br />Looks cheap....
4.0,"Just got it and so far looks and feels good. Simple watch, battery and solar power which I love and was looking for but this one's the only one I've come across so far that was as cheaply priced as this one was. Taking into account several reviews made on it I've decided that cheap price isn't necessarily a bad thing and hence chose to give it a chance. Liking it right now. Light, not to big and simple enough to figure out the controls especially with a little reading in the guide paper that came with it. If it can actually be reused over and over by changing out the battery when it goes bad and I've not broken the watch during that time I'll truly love the watch."
4.0,"I'm 5'10"" and this dress is a great length, not too short at all! Super comfy, can either lounge around or dress it up with accessories."
4.0,Great headbands - fun colors
4.0,"Quality cotton turtleneck at bargain price. Neck is comfortable, color is true. I'm usually between sizes and took the advice to size down. It's fitted enough to go underneath something, but I wouldn't wear it alone."
4.0,"I love Penguins to begin with and this shirt has it all... comfort, warmth not to hot but not cold. Material is A1. I will definitely buy from the Lazy One company again and again."
4.0,I like the color it is what they say it is
4.0,"I got this for my girlfriend, she's a Harry Potter fanatic. The wings fell off within the first week and the time was hard to set but otherwise a good purchase."
4.0,"im a drummer so i wanted this for my son! lol. umm honestly to say i live it because of what it says and the drum sticks, and the only reason it didn't get a 5 starts is because its pretty thin materials, it doesn't feel so rugged so we don't use it much, but its a nice little accessory!"
4.0,"I bought these sandals for my granddaughter and I like them very much, but unfortunately they didn't fit her. So that's why I'm returning them. I plan on buying them again just a size bigger."
4.0,Fit is good. Decent shirt/quality for the money.
4.0,"Very cute, though I was hoping for a little less form fitting. I am 5'1 and 117lbs ordered 27in."
4.0,"Love the quality and detail. The fit is a little tight in the arms and chest. Not so much that I needed to return it. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase"
4.0,It‚Äôs ok but a little small for a medium size
4.0,Crisp nice summer shirt
4.0,Super cute-great for the Texas summer
4.0,This is not the first time I have bought this item.  I like the sleeves because I golf every day and they help to protct my arms from the sun and help me cooler.  The last sleeves I received are bigger and do not fit as tightly as the first.  I prefer the tighter fitting type.
4.0,Great for a costume item for a one night event where you need to dress up for a play or something. Serves its purpose.
4.0,got lots of compliments on this dress but it is tighter than i expected it to be!
4.0,"I use this finger-less sleeve over my beer bottle when I go out and I get sooooo many compliments on my beer cozy, and they all are shocked that it is a sleeve. I just love it it also keep the bottle cold and not drip liquid off. I also got several other colors . It is little long so I just fold it under and it fits fine"
4.0,"This is a great little dress for the price! Just make sure you have a strapless slip to go with it as the material is very thin and somewhat see-through. The material isn't very high quality but what do you expect for a $13 dress. I got a large and I am 5 6', it fits well."
4.0,"Nice tank, but much browner than pictured."
4.0,Love the pants. Wish there were zippers instead of buttons in some pockets
4.0,It fit as expected but it was slightly short at the bottom. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äô and ordered a medium (my usal size). I expected it to be slightly longer than what came.
4.0,Fits nicely when aroused.  It's got an area for your boys that seems to hang down excessively though.  Just kind of hangs there and doesn't look totally normal.
4.0,"Cute, took forever to come"
4.0,"I am a much smaller chested woman and felt like this exaggerated that fact. I wore it for a Halloween costume (tried other shirts, but this fit the theme the best) and felt self-conscious a lot of the time. On the other hand, everywhere else on my body, this was incredibly flattering. And the comfort level was surprising as this is the first time I have ever worn a body suit on a night out."
4.0,I bought one pair size 38 and they were too small so I bought a size 40 and they fit great. I usually wear size 8 1/2 in U.S. The shoes are so cute I bought four other pairs
4.0,"Bought a size S/M, fit as I thought. Washed it once already, seemed to have shrunk a little but still fits fine. No complaints. Color is what was shown, very cute on. Definitely recommend buying."
4.0,Cute but buy a size smaller runs big to me. Which will give u no shape in this dress
4.0,"These are lovely earrings. While I'm not crazy about gold-dipped, I knew what to expect, and I love the natural stones. Lightweight."
4.0,Love my tee shirt! It is soft and fits perfect!
4.0,Looks good over everything
4.0,I bought this in a large because I assumed it would fit small and I like them to be loose fitting  like pictured. I was right to purchase a size up because they do fit small. It is longer than I expected however. Made wig great quality. Really like the look and feel.
4.0,"my toddler loves to splash around in the yard, and we also have 2 ducks that like to nibble so these are great shoes for her to have. I like that they are unisex and easy to get on and off. They help keep her legs and feet dry and keep the ducks from nibbling at her feet. Plus she looks adorable with them! gave 4 stars for now, because i dont know how durable/ long they last yet!"
4.0,The compression and durability is great but they were too short for my long legs
4.0,Daugher in Law loves the beatles and loves the socks
4.0,Really like this belt.  It's nice and bright red.....it does slightly have an odor like everyone has mentioned but its really minor......not that heavy.
4.0,I love pj jeans.  So happy you have the bootcut style in tall sizes.  Please provide the tall sizes in the leggins style.
4.0,"Very nice pajamas.  They wash up nice, too.  I wash them inside out.  I was afraid they would come out of the dryer all wrinkled, but they don't. I just fold them and put them in the drawer."
4.0,I love these underwear.  Every since like 3 minths ago when i started using amazin for the first time my cart always has things in it.üòÄ
4.0,"These leggings are amazing, great quality for the price. They do run a tad larger than expected but overall good quality"
4.0,"Feels a little cheaply made but will do the job of giving my gown shape. Also, it comes shipped inside out. I tried it on twice before my mom informed me it was inside out. LOL"
4.0,"Little on the small side, but still comfortable"
4.0,Fits as expected. Comfortable and made with good material.
4.0,"*I hollowed the instructions and ordered it a size larger than I usually wear, but I still couldn't button the waistband.  However, I simply removed the  band and hemmed the skirt around the top.  Overall, I liked it well enough to order a second one, in a different color--and TWO sizes up."
4.0,Nice but the twisting buckle feels a bit cheap. Very cool idea though and as little as it will be used it‚Äôll be great.
4.0,"As per the description of Amazon, the socks do what they are described to do. However, I wear an 8 shoe size, and the large size runs too big. I decided to keep them, and gave them to my husband,"
4.0,They fit on my 16 g horseshoe septum ring but are too big compared to the rest of the ring.
4.0,"They are very cute, but my feet aren't perfectly straight; they are a little angled and so they don't quite have a snug fit on my foot."
4.0,"For the price, it's a very cute and flattering suit. The waist comes up quite high, which help hide belly fat, and the ruched front seams add a slimming line also. The quality is not great (of the stitching, lining, etc.), but was exactly as expected for the price paid. Overall a good addition to your summer swimwear collection, nice to have something to change it up sometimes. I also wear the pieces separately and mix n' match--found a pair of high-waisted red bottoms that looked great with this top."
4.0,"Wore this to a holiday party. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but I still love it."
4.0,Makes me look like I have a camel toe but other than that it‚Äôs good material. Nice and thick and my panties don‚Äôt show through them which is always a bonus.
4.0,Well made. I should have paid more attention to the lace detail though. Didn't realize the lace overlay was covered in deer. Still pretty for a holiday though I guess.
4.0,"I ordered a large, fit is good, its a loose fitting top. ties mid waist.  looks like it does in the picture."
4.0,"I think it's pretty cool looking. But the workmanship is not superb. You can easily notice the flaws around the edges. The leather string is nice, not classy, but nice."
4.0,"Given as gift, to replace pair that were lost. Didn't realize how small they are, but recipient seemed pleased."
4.0,Beautiful dress runs big buy one size down.
4.0,Nice design but Sizes are hard to match.
4.0,I really think that this swimsuit is a great deal for just around $20 bucks.<br /><br />The material is nice and stretchy and is soft to the touch. I didn't realize that this swimsuit is a once piece but actually looks like a two piece because of the faux tankini. You don't really see that in the photos or the description so that was a bit of surprise but the faux tankini looks alright. The swimsuit has a white shear panel underneath the printed material so its got extra coverage in case the tankini part comes up.<br /><br />I really liked the push up part of this swimsuit. It reminds me of a victoria secret bra built right into the swimsuit. Its got crazy good padding.<br /><br />They were out of the swimsuit in size 14-16 so I got a 12-14 and its a little small on me. It still works but it is just a bit too tight to be really comfortable. I think these swimsuits might run a little on the small side.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion of the seller's product.

I'm just a regular Amazon shopper who purchases most online items from Amazon and I enjoy sharing my experiences with other shoppers. I hope that my review might help others make an informative buying decision.
4.0,"This is a very nice bathing suit.  I thought I was ordering a top, but it is a one-piece bathing suit.  I also ordered bottoms to go with it but don't need them.  The suit had the floral print all over it."
4.0,"This an extremely high quality Apple Watch band.  The band is not quite as nice as the original band on my watch, but is extremely well made and seems like it will hold up well.  I have metal sensitivity to buckles on cheap watch bands and was initially concerned this band might irritate my skin, however the buckle is high quality and I have not had any problems with it."
4.0,"I love this dress on me, it was definitely a show stopper, I suppose it's one of those dresses that you wear just once because the material is really cheap, super thin, putting it on I was worried that I would poke holes in it."
4.0,"These sunglasses are HOT.  They have a very couture look to them.  I've worn them the past few days and have received several compliments on them.  The cut off look works great for my face and even sort of thins out my noseline. They balance and don't move very much while wearing them, even in the hot sun. The only complaint I have is that they arrived a little loose on the sides.  Was an easy fix, but I would've liked to have had them more secure.<br /><br />I'd like to thank the seller for allowing me to purchase these sunglasses at a reduced price so that I could share my honest review."
4.0,"Bought at Costco and wanted more, but they were gone. Do not put in the dryer and wash on cold! No matter what, they do shrink a bit in length, though no biggy. I'm 5'3"", 106, and bought a small. Fits tight and we'll."
4.0,"I really like the way this piece looks. However, even with the adjustable clasps in the back, the front chains hang pretty low on me. I do have a small head though. Another downside is it gets tangled very easily. But other then that it is a very quality accessory."
4.0,Bought these for my husband.  He liked the fit though they were a little bigger than expected.
4.0,Dress is beautiful and a great price but the small is too small and the medium too large.
4.0,"Great bathing suit, has a slimming effect, not padded."
4.0,"Cute,sturdy yet lightweight. Fit nicely. I've never worn nipple shields before so these are nice for beginners to try. I wore for three days two nights and had no pain or irritation since they are so lightweight I slept with them in. I did take them out because of lack of sensation. But that's nothing against these I don't think. Maybe all nipple shields do that (hence the name?). but I had inverted nipples for so long I wanted to keep feeling my nipples and sensations so I went back to straight barbells. Anyway these are nice and worth the money. I attached a pic with them in my palm."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, great with the zippers and fit well except a little on the long side but I wear them daily. Light weight and easy to pack for my travels to warmer climates."
4.0,"Good color and polarization, and they seem very resilient. Two small issues: the clip fingers WILL scratch your lenses even though they are plastic coated. It would be difficult to prevent scratches with any kind of clip that touches or moves across your lens surface. The other, very small idiosyncrasy is with the plastic case (which I appreciate them providing). Rather than opening bottom to top, it opens left to right like a book. For some reason I always open it upside down (maybe because I'm right-handed?). Certainly nit picking, but I thought you should know. Otherwise very happy with their sun-blocking ability."
4.0,Love the dress but l don't like sleeveless any more.
4.0,Nice necklace. Good quality.
4.0,They seem to be warm but just note the color isn't snow white it's more of an off white (light beige)
4.0,Pretty color and style.  Fits a bit small for me.
4.0,"It's a compression sports bra. If you want support, you got it. But I would not recommend wearing it all day. It compresses but can also mess with digestion and give you gas bc of how tight the band is.<br />I wear to the gym and that's it."
4.0,The shirts fit smaller than normal
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, fit true to size but super thin not recommend to wear in cold weather"
4.0,A little large for my face. Good customer support.
4.0,"Size:  order 1-2 sizes up<br />Fabric: perfect weight, stretchy enough  to accommodate size variation<br />Thought I was getting the lighter color though<br />Construction:  overall good, a little larger proportionally in the shoulders than needed. May need to alter this.<br />Shipping:  came in approximately 3 weeks, slightly sooner than projected."
4.0,"Love this, but I do have a complaint. the tiers slide off very easily. Looks great, but not very practical"
4.0,Liked the EGA design.  Showed up with only 2 filters.  But don't generally use them so it was ok.
4.0,These are amazing!  Soft as Lularoe and true to size.  Will buy from them again!
4.0,I really like it but should have ordered one size up.
4.0,Good. But...
4.0,"Beautiful little charm.  The necklace itself has some issues with twisting and is not of a good weight and I would suggest just tossing it out, but the charm is lovely."
4.0,"Nice.  I haven't worn it yet, but it is nice."
4.0,"Well, have to admit they do what they claim to do - they brighten your vision in low light, and they do help your vision when driving in the dark - I have poor night vision and these help immensely. Unfortunately for the price (I paid about $17) I expected a certain level of quality and these are pretty poor - they sit very crookedly on my face - one side hits my cheek and the other sits very high off of it, the plastic is too cheap to adjust - these are not even boxstore  level quality - more like &#34;DollarStore&#34; level quality frames. Still, considering they have helped my night driving so much, I am not willing to send them back and try another brand / type - I will keep these..."
4.0,Got this as a casual dress for dinners and I love it
4.0,Product is ok. Really for a young girl.
4.0,"I don't actually think the toe box is tight but there is a wire or something that hangs down inside the toebox. that is very uncomfortable. love the shoe but because of the wire I am afraid to order another pair and it is really too late to return them,,,my bad"
4.0,Very nice.  Suits my needs.  Wish it had more credit card slots and an external pocket for my phone.
4.0,These glasses fit my face and are very clear.
4.0,Don't stay up over knee but still love them!
4.0,"This is a very nice tote especially for the price.  Generous size, fits a thin laptop and normal office things.  Straps long enough to go over the shoulder, but short enough to carry on the forearm.  Nice.  A few things to note 1) the white pattern is very nice but only on ONE side.  Not a deal breaker at all, but still not clear from the photos.  2) it was shipped folded flat, with a foam tube in the ""fold"" on the all black side.  The fold is visable when unpacked and loaded.  It is useable certainly, but not a perfect packing solution. I believe it will ""hang"" out overtime.  3) good organization pockets inside, but no key hook 4) hardware is good tone.<br /><br />All in all a fine tote for the very low price."
4.0,I like the feel of the shirt but it is a little on the big side and a little long.
4.0,Sunglasses good but somewhat large
4.0,"They look very cute, the glow in the dark aspect looks amazing! I haven't put them in yet so I gave em 4 stars, but overall I'm happy with them."
4.0,Exactly as pictured - a very attractive pin.
4.0,"Love the shirt and get a lot of compliments on it. The material is kinda clingy - not t-shirt material. I ordered a size L ( I am 5'9, 189 lbs, usually wear a large) I think I would have been more comfortable with am XL."
4.0,"Very attractive, heavy, well-made.  I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the actual size, because it's much larger than I was expecting, but it's not a deal-breaker.  Definitely meant for a man, unless a woman might wear it outside her clothing, in which case I think women would also find this attractive."
4.0,Really liking these hats! Wish they would come up with a few new styles on the hunting side but they‚Äôre great hats!
4.0,I like the fit and it looks rich like the photo
4.0,Liked the look/style<br />Fits well<br />Don't like that it's hang dry.
4.0,Beautiful but does not fit like an extra large.
4.0,Love this scarf.  Very cute.  Soft and light weight.
4.0,It was very beautiful...Great colors...Nice material
4.0,Cute funny shirt.  Dies shrink a little.
4.0,Nice functional wallet........the best thing is that it does not smell!!
4.0,"The top for perfectly, I am around 90lbs but the skirt was a tad bit big for me. But overall I was pleased I suppose."
4.0,A very pretty pairs of shoes... The heels is bit high but hey if you walk in heels before you surely can handle this chic.... It matched with most of my outfits... Look hot with skinny jeans...sweet with dresses... The reason it got 4 star just because it didn't have my size 5 so I have to order size 5.5 otherwise this would be 5 stars it just perfect
4.0,These trousers can look a bit more like 'painters pants' than the Jean cut would suggest.  They are comfortable for all that.  I like them.
4.0,"it's beautiful, the only thing will be that it is a little big on my wrist, but nothing to complaint about :)! LOVE IT!"
4.0,Runs a bit bigger than I expected but nice quality. It‚Äôs a bit more like a dress than I was hoping
4.0,Nice shirt...ran a bit large so got a size down. The biggest issue is the snaps are sort of loose so they pop open easily.
4.0,"so it does keep cool very well, but if you're getting this for virus protection don't, I knew this going in so I bought a cloth mask to go under this one. I use this one help keep cool and because it looks better then a lame cloth mask alone."
4.0,Received quickly and fast no ropes or damage
4.0,"I got this as a gift for my niece for Christmas, and although she hasn‚Äôt received it yet...I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll love it. It‚Äôs very lightweight, yet sturdy."
4.0,"Adorable and very nice quality.  A little snug at the top, but not terribly. Granddaughter loves them!"
4.0,Cute and simple. My boyfriend loved the dress as he is partial to the off the shoulder look so he gave it five stars.  It is quite short so I took one star away.
4.0,Wrong colors came but the good thing is they are comfortable and warm....
4.0,"Overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase. They run just a bit big. I wear 32 pants and I ordered the medium. The inner drawstring really helps, also if you plan on wearing thin pants underneath them. Of course this is just my opinion, and I‚Äôll be the first to admit I‚Äôm not always correct. Great thickness and warmth, they‚Äôll  keep you warm climbing a mountain or camping overnight."
4.0,"These gloves are okay. After a few wears they fit pretty well, and they are comfortable. They‚Äôre also quite attractive.<br /><br />That said, as I‚Äôve seen other reviewers mention, the fingers are ridiculously long. This has improved somewhat as the gloves shape to my hands, but there‚Äôs still way too much space at the top of the pointer fingers. I‚Äôve also noticed that the lining has already started to pill, and I don‚Äôt think it will last too long. The gloves are also not very warm, but after all I bought them for style, not utility, so I‚Äôm not surprised about that.<br /><br />Overall these are okay gloves. Not fantastic, but stylish and comfortable. They also do appear to be genuine leather, as they were much too tight when I got them but have expanded and shaped nicely over time."
4.0,"I got the &#34;Bohemia Print White&#34; pattern.  Overall I like the cover up, the material feels great, is lightweight, and is very slightly see through.  Fits much better than I expected- I do NOT think someone who normally requires plus sizes would fit into this. It somewhat falls off my shoulders at times but I plan to sew the back &#34;V&#34; up about 4-5 inches which helps with protecting my back from the sun and prevents the dress from falling off my shoulders yet is still easy to put on.  My biggest complaint is the bottom/skirt portion is about 2 inches off center (to the left) and the design does not lend itself to being that way so it looks like a mistake- I would have returned it if it wasn't such as great price."
4.0,Belt delivered as promised and very satisfied with the product.
4.0,"Okay, it's huge, but I like it anyway and will keep it.  It must be around a size 4X and I'm not, but I love 100% cotton."
4.0,"Absolutely love this bag. It's even cuter live. Has several compartments to cater to everything I need to put in there. Didn't give a five star rating cause the straps are peeling a little, so I have to be mindful how I handle it."
4.0,"Im a Large in the measurements but i got an X-Large because if it didnt fit i didnt want to return it! It turned out too small it turned out to be a bit tight! Great prodouct thought! I overall love it ,kinda disappointed th top ruffle didnt go all around the top of the skirt !"
4.0,"This case is sturdy and functional, while being fashionable at the same time. It is loud when you close it, though, and the clamshell edges don't line up perfectly every time. It is definitely holding up to my abuse!"
4.0,It is just a basic watch to wear nothing fancy but it is what I expected for the money I spent. I like the bright light up function to check the time quickly at night with push of side button. I ordered it for large display numbers.
4.0,"The length is not 15.4 inches, instead 14 inches. If you want the sleeve to the wrist, you must pull down from the shoulder and the edge will show with a short sleeve tee on.  With the edge at the shoulder, I have a 3/4 length sleeve. Stated length is incorrect and I am unhappy with that. I have small arms and just letting you know, they fit snug and run short."
4.0,"Came as 3-pack; the EKG pattern & stripes were ok, the heart pattern left imprints on my legs. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù & ~130#. The compression was good, they‚Äôre very comfortable. My uniforms are navy blue so I‚Äôd prefer navy or black socks without the patterns. Overall, I recommend & would buy again."
4.0,"I am 5'9 and I weigh 148lbs and a large fit perfectly. I'm usually a medium, but ordered a size up as recommended. It's a cute and sexy one piece."
4.0,"The split on the side is really deep,  I have big hips so the split was show a lot.  I should have size up. I going to order large next time. Super cute body icon dress  üî•"
4.0,"This fit me perfectly! Including the sleeves, which for some reason, I've been having a problem with lately when I purchase tops from Amazon. I'm an average sized woman, but the sleeves are barely  touching my wrist bone (like the picture). But I was pleasantly surprised that these sleeves came right to my hand; a perfect fit! The material is super soft and comfy. It feels like all cotton (but it's not). I love the color ~ true to the picture! The high-low hem is a nice touch. It's a thinner (but not cheap) material, so it's great for fall or spring, but you could definitely throw a cardigan on and wear it in the cooler months. The cut out shoulders are super cute, but I was hoping the cut out would be placed differently, or at least narrow enough so that the opening doesn't fall EXACTLY where my bra strap is...but it's not:( ~ I'm going to have to wear a sports bra with this (or maybe just a cami with a built in shelf bra. Other than that, I really like this shirt."
4.0,"We received it and it is beautiful! We use it for all of our &#34;fancy&#34; watches, it is a little on the big side but I do like how nice it looks. Seems to be working great!"
4.0,"El producto es magn√≠fico, una corea suave f√°cil de poner y ajustar en la mano . Lo que no me agrado fueron los colores son totalmente diferentes . En la foto se ven con m√°s color y realmente son colores mate ."
4.0,"Works great! Used it on my snowmobile under my helmet and it actually kept my mask from fogging as much. The fit is tight, as it is intended to be with this design of balaclava. It‚Äôs also not intended to keep you warm like most people must have thought, hence some of the bad reviews. I also used it skiing, as just a face mask type deal. Blocked the wind well because of the tightly woven, silk like, material. All in all it does exactly what it is suppose to do. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the seem in the front is right down the middle of the mouth and feels a little weird at first. Hope they change that in future designs"
4.0,"I absolutely love this bathing suit. It fits well and the sizing chart worked for me. I wear a size 12 and am small chested so the top fit well. I haven't yet worn it in the water, so don't know how it will perform when wet. I just wish the middle had more of a control top to suck my gut in more. Hopefully the dark color will help to camouflage my middle."
4.0,Love the belt looks just like photo. Haven‚Äôt worn out yet but seems like a good item out the box.
4.0,"Super cute too! It is a bit short, so I only wear with super high waist jeans. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7."
4.0,Love the pants just a little snug
4.0,too small.  Easy return. Jeans seemed liked the were well made.
4.0,Good wallet. Material is a little poor. But very good so far. Would recommend.
4.0,"It's small in size than I expected. When you look at it, it looks kind of less quality but when you put it, it gives a very elegant look. But I am disappointed with its size."
4.0,Just as pictured fits looser than I expected but ok since stretchy.
4.0,The fabric is lightweight and fit as expected.
4.0,They are all metal. I constantly get compliments on these shades!
4.0,Runs a little small for an XL- but it still fit. Didn't risk it in the dryer though- the cat hangs out to dry.
4.0,"My girlfriend loves it when her man wears leather gloves, so I ordered leather gloves for driving her around. These came with a soft pouch which was a great way to keep these stored in my glove compartment. My girlfriend loves the color and the feel of the leather. The gloves feel great on my hands too. I measured my hands with tape and ordered a size 8, and the gloves wrap around snug and comfortable, however the glove fingers aren't as long as mine so there is some spacing between the glove and where my fingers meet. Everything else about the glove I love!"
4.0,"Super cute, however they fall out easily"
4.0,"The shirt is nice and came as it was described. The fitting was smaller than I anticipated, but arrived in good condition. I am 5'11 and 155 pounds and I have other compression shirts that fit well sized medium and large. I ordered this one in a large and it was still too big for me. I recommend ordering two sizes up from your regular size if you want it to fit comfortably."
4.0,"These gloves look smart, they are comfortable and well make. They can also be worn while using a touchscreen with no problem. My hands are borderline between two sizes, I bought the smaller of the two and they might be just a tad small but definitely wearable. The gloves are warm enough for most of the weather here in Boston Ma. but there are days when I switch over to my mittens. The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because I reserve that rating for items that are truly extraordinary."
4.0,Loved it<br />Fit Perfect<br />I couldn‚Äôt remember what size so hopefully its on the review<br />Dress did come with a small hole but nothing major!!
4.0,Pretty color burgundy but material is so synthetic it‚Äôs itchy. I do have uber sensitive skin tho. Nice style and is pretty true to size. Fits well all over.
4.0,Very stylish but heavy. Its is a beautiful piece that I love. I have worn this a lot and you get used to the weight but other than that very nice!
4.0,Pretty but super thin. Not what I was looking for. :-(
4.0,I really liked it but the skirt lining seemed inside out.  The shiny side was against the skin.  It was so pretty though and fit great.
4.0,Very comfortable and loose fitting - just what I wanted.
4.0,Arrived ahead of anticipated date. Product is just as picture shows!
4.0,"I really like it a lot, Only down sides are, the money clip isn‚Äôt as strong as we wanted it to be and the adjustable strap is a little on the cheaper side. All in all, it‚Äôs still really nice"
4.0,"I bought the gold and silver option, since it was the one with free prime shipping. For $15, you can't go wrong. I was afraid the silver would dominate the gold, but it's very beautiful. I look better in gold but this watch suits me, and would probably be universally flattering between warm and cool toned skin colors. My only complaint is the watch strap - its thick and inflexible right out of the box. However, over time, it should flex a bit more. The band also runs a bit small, so if you have big wrists, I suggest looking elsewhere."
4.0,"It fits well, but I'm concerned about the longevity of the material. Only time will tell on that note, but for the price I'll be buying a few more."
4.0,Lindos pero un poco pesados
4.0,"Arrived quickly, nice light color, and the apple shaped metal is alright.<br />a couple thing that i didnt really like would be its smaller than my thumb finger so wished it was a little bigger since its a cute little jewl  though now i think about it, the price is a little high for the tiny peice...)<br />and another one would be that the metal apple isnt nicly smoothed out with the gem. im not saying that the metal itself is rough or that the lining is off and ugly. its the part where the gem and the metal meet that isnt smoothed out so it dosent look like one nice peice.<br />oh, and its nice that the back of the jewl has a metal loop so you could put wires to make in to a necklace."
4.0,It looks cute. It fits but it get uncomfortable after a few hours. I have big ribs. I think I ordered a L or XL. My boyfriend thinks its cute.
4.0,The most important thing that I've seen in the reviews is that they are too light or the image is just stickers. They are NOT stickers!! It's a protective clear sticker on the front in back! It makes it look faded and bubbled!<br />This would be a 5 stars but sadly the Yuki key chain came broken where the chain is so it's not useable ;-; however! These are well made cute keychains just remember to take off the protective stickers!
4.0,ordered first shirt loved it fits true to size best ever buy bought second one same size much smaller will give as gift as does not fit properly as first one did ??????? but if you get proper size one of best buys i have made. your dime but may be worth the gamble
4.0,Beautiful outfit. It is a little short above the knee but I am 5'7&#34;. This outfit is very flattering.
4.0,Very nice glad how it turned out. I would recommend you get a size larger then you want. We got an XL for a friend I tried it on and couldn‚Äôt zip it up and the sleeves were to long. Luckily the fried is taller then me & he loves it & apparently never zips his coats up.<br />Would recommend just a size more then you want
4.0,Quality wallet.  Magnet is strong on the money clip side.  Only complaint was the wallet smelled like shoe polish.  Didn't have that nice leather smell.  It went away after a few days and I've been enjoying using this wallet.  Leather feels nice and soft.  I'd definitely buy another.
4.0,Apparently &#34;Punch/Black/Volt/Metallic Gold Coin&#34; Translates to Pink with yellow Swoosh.<br />Shoes fit good and my 6 yr old boy likes the shoes and has already test drove them on the lawn.<br />We expected Red based on the picture provided...but it's definitely Pink.<br />Would have given 5 stars if color description and picture were more accurate.<br />So heads up...
4.0,Comfortable but not as supportive as I would like. I do not like the removable pads because they will not stay in place when washing.
4.0,"Sleeves are not nearly as long as in the picture, other than that its a nice shirt with great thick sweatshirt like material"
4.0,"The bracelet is pretty and fits perfect. There is a very strong chemical smell in the leather band part, not sure if it is safe to wear directly on the skin."
4.0,"This product is very well made.  I love the tight knitting.  I have a big head so it slides up every so often.  Other than that, it does the job."
4.0,These are nice but they were too big for my very tiny ears so I had to send them back.  Vendor does not carry a smaller size.  But they are NICE!!
4.0,"The shirt is cute, but it was somewhat larger than what I thought it would be."
4.0,This is really a nice looking piece.The only problem I have with it is that it rus a little small. I'm about a half inch from being able to latch it.I'll try wearing it as a bangle as it is a sturdy piece.
4.0,"Loved it at first, but then a small tear developed when I brushed it against the corner of my suitcase. I was surprised it tore so easily... Still it was my fault for not being more careful..."
4.0,Good quality. Didn‚Äôt care for them once I put them in.
4.0,very cute but tight in chest leaving a gap in back.... But nice material and would work year round.
4.0,Color is beautiful.
4.0,They are beanies. They fit like beanies.
4.0,Color is nothing like picture; Its way lighter  makes me really wonder if it‚Äôs real jade.
4.0,"Beautiful, just not as comfortable as I thought they would be...not terribly uncomfortable, need little more padding!!"
4.0,"I like it very much, and is a great bargain for it's price. Highly recommended."
4.0,Well made dress. Doesn't fit me well though. Is too small in the bust area. I am 5'4 127 lbs and wear a 34c. It isn't made for my body type. I usually wear a size 6.
4.0,I liked them all.  Cute fit good and liked the colore
4.0,"Nice quality. Good material, stitched very well."
4.0,Little tight for overall I like them
4.0,Queda muy bien y la tela es de calidad
4.0,My child loved it. And it‚Äôs very comfortable and cute.
4.0,"These glasses are comfortable and cute. The shades of glasses give you a nice selection to choose from, but the plastic is a bit thinner than I'd hoped for.<br />If you're wearing them outside in the sun, there's usually a glare on the inside of the lenses."
4.0,The part that goes into the ear is wide and a little uncomfortable.  Other than that. I love them.
4.0,Comfortable and perfect for ski trip.
4.0,Works well and looks good. The watch I received was not Dovoda it was a different brand but looked similar enough to keep
4.0,Bought this for my husband to wear on Halloween in NOLA.  It fit him well.  Would have liked it better with an elastic band versus ribbon ties.
4.0,Like the product but a couple broke in the first two days
4.0,"Its definatly not flannel, its a pretty cool shirt. 5'5 160 size L fit."
4.0,Light and breathable.
4.0,Used it on my yoga mat during my workout. It only moved once during the 30 minute workout. Would buy more.
4.0,Please write more about your materials. There is a lack of information about the material of the product. it was not well made button holes were not even opened properly. It was a very good design and colour.
4.0,"My son loves these gloves, he was so excited to be even more like Spidey.  They fit him well, at 3 1/2 years old, 43 lbs.  If he was much bigger I think they would be too tight. Definitely worth the money to see that smile:)"
4.0,The person loved them and they look great on!
4.0,"Not too heavy, lightweight material"
4.0,It is just as described.
4.0,"These were just as pictured but when I went to thread them it hurt a bit, would advise a lubricant, water or something. I still like them however."
4.0,"I did read the reviews about the sizing, but it was really to small.  The product was not available in a larger size so I took a chance but had to return it.  I do like the jacket and hope in time it will be available in a larger size.  I think the makers of the jacket should re-size it so everyone doesn't have to guess if it will fit. And please please make larger sizes!"
4.0,"I have close to a 9"" wrist and most aftermarket watch bands for the Galaxy watch 4 only go to 8.5"", forcing me to use the largest hole.  This elastic band will work for any size wrist.  It's comfortable, easy to swap out and easy to adjust.  I am removing one star because the adjustment does seem to slip a little bit after a full day of use."
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace that I purchased to wear at a wedding I went to in October..unfortunately, when I put it on, one of the longer strands broke, so I wasn't able to wear it, and it is too late to return..very sad, as it is a very nice item"
4.0,Big on top for small chested woman
4.0,"Very nice looking dresses and affordable price for bridesmaids! I love the color and although the fit ran small, I still think they are very much worth the purchase. Just remember to order AT LEAST one size up."
4.0,I love Drymax products especially the thin ones.  These are a little too thicker than I expected.
4.0,Was a gift and friend loved it.  It fit well.
4.0,"These have good arch support and are pretty soft. (Not as soft as yoga mat flip-flops, but soft & comfortable.) I have had other arch support flip-flops like Archies. In comparison, these don‚Äôt mold as precisely to your feet and they are a little on the heavy side so you find yourself curling your toes down a bit to keep them on. But the price is a lot cheaper than Archies. I wear a size 9 shoe but I got these an 8 1/2, like  I always do with my flip-flops, and they fit well. They are nice and comfortable but I wouldn‚Äôt go for a really long walks in them"
4.0,"I would rather have a silicone band for comfort and look, but this band does what it's suppose to.  I have no issues charging with the band on, nor has it ever come off while being worn..  I ride a motorcycle a lot and the vibrations don't bother it at all.  It's a bit heavier than I would like, but overall not a bad option for the money."
4.0,"I love it with one exception. I wish the bottom was reinforced with some kind of plastic or something to make it more sturdy. However, I know that makes the folding up part ( which is the best part) difficult. Not sure how they would accomplish that. Anyway, it is a remarkable bag, quite large for how small it folds up, and is easy to open up.  It zippers closed to make it into the folded version, and it would be great for traveling.  I can see us using this for multiple things and multiple trips."
4.0,Cooking
4.0,Very nice and secure card holder.
4.0,Great bino pack.  Lite weight and comfy.
4.0,"3M Peltor H10 Optime 105 is a pretty good earmuff which reduces overall noise quite well. Having just purchased this item from a hardware store, further use will determine how these relate to other earmuffs I have owned.<br /><br />UPDATE: they work as well as most other quality ear muffs I have used. The headband spring tension gives me a bit of a headache after a few hours of use but, that helps the sound deadening. The FACT is, if it wasn't tight, it wouldn't work as well. The comfort (pressure/headache) also depends on how precise you fit it.<br /><br />The retail clam shell package shown here does not state the actual model by name and only states, &#34;3M tekk ProtectionTM&#34;, &#34;Professional Earmuff&#34;, &#34;30dB&#34;, &#34;90561&#34;.<br /><br />This item is the Optime 105, based upon ALL images on the 3M and 3M Peltor websites as well as Amazon. The 3M Peltor Optime 105 is Red/Black (no other color) 30dB BEST suited for sound levels up to 105dB. Some of the Optime 105s are printed differently on the ear cups and all have an un-colored molding of &#34;PELTOR&#34; on each ear cup.<br /><br />I needed replacement ear cushions &#34;hygiene kits&#34; for other earmuffs and find they can be hard to find and relatively expensive compared to a new earmuff (price gouging). I could not find the kit for these Red/Black earmuffs on this product page because the kits are not labeled so you can figure it out. I happened to take off the ear cushion and found the marking of HY10 for replacements which is much of how I determined the actual model (optime 105). Replacement &#34;Hygiene Kits&#34; are available and include foam and ear cushion pads but for the price, they are barely worth it. On the 3M site the kits are about $20 shipped, and on Amazon they are about 17.<br /><br />My next purchase will most likely be the top end of 3M's line, the 3M Peltor X series because they indicate they provide more protection at a cheaper price (go figure) with cheaper hygiene kits.<br /><br />The science behind muffling sound limits the overall maximum for earmuffs, besides the fact that glasses, hair, facial shape, fitment, resonance through your head, etc affect sound levels. 3 decibels = twice the sound volume so if you look at it from a car audio description shows that it takes double the power to increase 3 decibels."
4.0,"My measurements for reference: 5'8&#34;, 136lbs, 34&#34; 26&#34; 38&#34;. I consider myself somewhat thin with a large frame. I'm usually a S, sometimes M, 4-6 garment size.<br /><br />I bought a M as I was worried about torso length. It fits well & was long enough in the arms & legs. Sleeves are tapered so I will likely wear them pushed up. The fabric is VERY metallic, is not see-through, drapes well & has enough weight to it that it doesn't cling.<br /><br />My only issue is the neckline, which is a bit too plunging for me. I plan to either pin it or wear something under. I attached pics with it belted & unbelted. As a reminder, it comes unbelted."
4.0,Pretty watch but hard to adjust the wrist band.
4.0,"Too small, had to return them:("
4.0,Good Hat and is As Depicted. Feels a Little Fragile but I Only Had It for A Day So Far. It Comes Packed With The Hat Kind of Out of Shape But You Can Adjust It Easily
4.0,"This is nice and really sexy. However, if you are larger than a C cup, your boobs will probably fall out. I'm a 34 C and mine were falling out, but I just pushed them back in and it was fine. Also, the cuffs chain did brake lose after the first wear, but I just retied it on."
4.0,great shirt my son loved it
4.0,"I received this swimsuit for free to test and review.<br /><br />Note to all. This is not a suit for wearing if you are going to be swimming laps, surfing, water skiing, or any thing other than wading in. The bottom is tied on and the ties are not secure enough to keep it on if there is external pressure of the water against them. You will lose the bottom and possibly even the top.<br /><br />The bottom is a small one. It is meant for smaller behinds, so if you have a bubble bottom, don't try this. It will not fit properly for full rear coverage. Think ultra low rise jeans.<br /><br />The top is made so that it cradles breasts, but if you size it incorrectly, you will pop out of the cups. Think push up bra style. This will fit under a c-cup, but be cautious if you are over that. Just as with bras, not every style or model will fit every body. Properly sized, this adds a bit of cleavage without having half of the breast sitting on a shelf, just waiting to pop out if you decide to play volleyball. (On second thought, unless it is a racy game of volley ball, don't play in this suit unless you are an a/b cup.)<br /><br />The material is soft and the suit is well made. There are no loose threads or obvious missed stitches. It should hold together great for at least this season's summer.<br /><br />It arrived in a PVC bag that left the smell all through this suit. I had to wash it four times in lingerie detergent to get the odor out. There is no way I could even try it on before doing this, the smell was burning my nose. While the bag seems like a good idea, I won't buy or review another suit by Raintropical because of it. I am very sensitive to odors and I don't like having to wash something several times to remove strong odors."
4.0,This is a very good religious bracelet to own.
4.0,Christmas.
4.0,Ordered this for my step daughter who's a mens medium. We ordered her an XL becuase she loves her hoodies to be huge.  It fits like a large. I recommend ordering a size up. Super soft on the inside! She loves it.
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter and she loves them.
4.0,Very pretty! Just make sure you order a size larger than you usually need.
4.0,"bought this because of the good reviews on this site and they were right on.  It is very comfortable, breathable, and soft.  It sometimes does move around a bit, but that is tolerable as it is better than any other mask I've owned.  I have no problems sleeping with it from the first night and it's my favorite mask to date.  Ironic as it's the cheapest one I've ever bought.  Highly recommend this!"
4.0,"This dress is super comfy and hangs well. The sizing runs large. I am a Medium/Large and wanted this just for around the house, so I ordered a large. It fits more like a 2XL.  My friend purchased a Medium and she usually runs Medium/Large. It was so big on her that it would fall off her shoulders. I wear her Medium one more than my Large."
4.0,The first charm on the left is an example of how it came. The middle charm is me putting black sharpie marker on it. The charm on the right is after I wipe it off with a cotton ball and isopropyl alcohol. I do this after I do my own metal stamping so the letters stand out more. Every charm in this 30 pack are going to require this. I removed one üåü from my rating because they are not immediately ready for use. The other thing I would note is the charms appear to be scratched. This scratched appearance makes it hard to read the words. I wouldn't be able to metal stamp these 4 words on such a small space so I am alright with the product and price.
4.0,"These are nice and cute, but I liked the leggings I got via Amazon from D4E better, as they are softer and more comfortable."
4.0,Fits well and looks cute
4.0,Love the dress. It's a bit too long and Im 5.3 which is why I gave 4 stars. The size Lg was perfect for my size if you want it to fit loose like the picture.
4.0,Good looking shirt.  Works well with the muscular build
4.0,Love how this sock hugs the foot!
4.0,"The color is a little brighter than the photograph, but everything else is as pictured.  Cotton/rayon blend I think.  Keeps dust and bugs off.  Quick shipment."
4.0,"Inexpensive belt, serves its purpose, won't last forever!"
4.0,You can expect a nice dressing.Sadly this is a must for me.
4.0,The large was too small even when i looked at the size chart. returned for the xl the large was snug. i am 163 in weight.
4.0,"It was long in the torso. Otherwise, nice fabric. Very comfortable."
4.0,"I like this product, The masks I ordered were loose and this product allowed me to connect it behind the head and not have the loose masks go to waste. I have tried ones I bought from a Big Box Store and they were stiff and I felt them scratching my head. These however are comfortable to wear, I like them so far!"
4.0,This is exactly what I was looking for to complete a locket I was designing.
4.0,Like the product they're made extremely well wish they would have made the hole for the Paracord just a little bigger just a little tough to get put through the hole other than that these things are great
4.0,Very pretty would buy more ..
4.0,"I got this as a gift from my boyfrend, I am obsessed with Harry Potter, I think this bracelet looks amazing, but I am not sure it is actually silver plated, it has tarnished exremly quickly which makes me sad, it is alsso a bit tricky to put on, but over all I really do like it"
4.0,Be aware of how small the ‚Äú small size ‚Äú is. I can only put the thingy in the first hole or so. My wrist is already tiny so these are extra small. I do like the colors in the variety pack though.
4.0,it‚Äôs very soft to the touch and made well.  i‚Äôve found it too warm to wear in s. florida.
4.0,You cant go wrong with Kjallraven products. They are not the least inexpensive but they are quality.
4.0,"Finally I found a true navy blue mask. It may not be easy to tell from the pictures, but the string to keep the mask on must be tied. I have very curly hair and the string was long enough to fit around my head. I cant imagine the string not fitting someone. Even with the mask being made out of lace it is not itchy and keeps its shape. My only issue is that the eye area is a little small so I had to readjusting the mask throughout the night."
4.0,"If you're a Naruto Series fan, you'll love the Chibi Sasuke, vz. 2 key chain.  My kids love it."
4.0,"I ordered a size up and it was still tight. but it did seem to stretch a bit. Very short, comes to rib cage rather than waist line like I expected"
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because I've only worn one once in the 3 days I've had them. But I do LOVE so far! Amazon suggested a xxl or xl because they do run a wee bit snug however I bought the xxl and it fits very comfortably. Not too loose that I cannot wear it under a t-shirt but not too tight that I can't breathe. The fabric is delicious, super soft. Also, I'm 5 foot 7, have a semi muscular build at 190lbs. Would buy again"
4.0,"I purchased this for my mom who was in the market for a red purse. She loved it. It's not too big...not too small. Now, she's looking for shoes to match!"
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; 135lbs athletic build and I ordered 4/6. The dress fit perfectly and good quality. Be prepared to have the dress dry cleaned and pressed before you can wear it.
4.0,Lovely dress it fits beautifully the inserts for the chest area ane a little bit larger than I expected but I am able to fold them down which I think is a much nicer look.
4.0,"I purchased the larger size, my daughter is 3 and it fit very small."
4.0,Definitely slightly bigger than I expected (just about as big as a penny) but great quality and super cute! came in 2 days. The blue is super bright and pretty and the chain is delicate and pretty!
4.0,"Decent belt. Made well. However, the sizes are smaller than expected ."
4.0,"This mask is available with many different colors and messages. I like the message I got, but am reviewing the quality of the product. Arrived quickly with three interchangable washable filters. I get four wearings per cycle, one with no filter and one with each washable filter. Comfy, does not shift or shrink. Very pleased."
4.0,I was very skeptical buying these because there aren't any reviews. They are adorable. They did shrink a little bit on the first wash. So I would definitely order up a size. I'll be wearing these a lot.
4.0,Used it for our purple prince day at work
4.0,"These arrived yesterday. Tried them on then went to the computer to order a second one. Wonderful look and feel, good stretch. They do run smaller than all my other pants of the same size, though. If you're not planning to lose 5-10 pounds, might consider the next size up."
4.0,Fit is a bit larger. Quality is average.<br />Over all good summer dress.
4.0,I like that you get several different styles of necklaces to choose from. The easiest way to determine which one to wear is to try it on with your dress.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4c13e86b6b6500d5d992f6ad592617eb]] I would recommend this watch winder to anyone looking for a great product.<br />Pros:<br />-Wood is beautiful and looks very expensive.<br />-The winding motors are very quiet and has lots of adjustability.<br />-The lights are fully adjustable from brightness to color to pattern of lights.<br />-App is very easy to use to control lights<br />-Many watches fit in the watch holder.<br />Cons:<br />-Once opening the case the material inside ‚Äúleather‚Äù is not soft to touch.<br />-The watch holders are plastic and seem low quality.<br />-The lock didn‚Äôt feel secure when turning the key and seems like it could jam easily.<br /><br />Overall I think the watch winder is excellent from a visual appearance and works well doing its job but up close could use more high quality materials for the parts you will interact the most with.
4.0,Arrived quickly. Perfect for what we needed even though the lens frame was bigger than expected ü§ì
4.0,Item seemed to be well made and has the look and weight of real gold<br />Lobster clasp faded in color after three weeks
4.0,"I prefer slouchy hats. These bring a definite slouch, at least for me as I'm a 5'1"" woman. But they are fairly sizable and have some stretch so I think they'd do for quite a lot of people. The Burgundy and Navy set of two hats is a great bargain but are too thin for winter. They'd look stylish but not keep me warm. I am sending them back into the wild for now since I need a winter hat instead but might repurchase these again next fall. They seem best for autumn or someone primarily interesting in a hat for fashion not warmth. Highly recommend if you don't need a warmer hat. Seem reasonably well made for the money."
4.0,I love the Boysenberry color which is exactly as it appears on the product page. The trim is a Light Golden color not Pinkish which I would have preferred. The set is true to US size with enough room under the arms & in the chest. The material feels soft & silky and breaths. As you wear this set it expands a little making it even more comfortable.  I Washed the set in my Washing machine in Cold water on Permanent Press and Hung to Dry.  I used Spray 'n Wash Pre-Treat Laundry Stain Stick on some stains and they came out perfectly.
4.0,"Great color, but strap isn‚Äôt very long if you normally wear a size M/L Apple Watch band.  Probably better for size S/M."
4.0,Nice dress. Not for hot days as the material doesn't breathe well.  Tight on the chest if you are busty.  Plenty of room at the hip.
4.0,A little too dark blue. Almost black. But they fit and look cool.
4.0,Everything 0k.
4.0,Not for warm weather!
4.0,We got this for a granddaughter who turned 10 and she absolutely loved it would recommend I don't know for anyone older than that but for her it was great
4.0,I was hoping the colors would be a bit more vibrant.
4.0,"I liked the fabric, the style, the high rise, the ability to choose the length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10.5‚Äù and the 32 length sits right at the top of my foot.  Not all of us want the tight skinny leg pants. These are a great compromise. Not leg hugging but slender and stylish."
4.0,"Great price for 3, as I paid $10 for one pair at Walmart. Now I have pairs to spare! Not heavy-duty, but they work - I'm not a fan of regular prescription sunglasses, nor of Transitions lenses, so these work great for me! Many sizes you can choose from!"
4.0,"The pants are thin, but fit nicely and are fine for the price"
4.0,"Beautifully made, strong necklace my daughter wears it daily."
4.0,These come attached.  But they clean nicely.
4.0,"Clot more toward peach and fabric super soft but yes, thin. But it is a beautiful fit. Sizing chart worked"
4.0,"Very cute, smaller than anticipated,  but beatiful"
4.0,"Decent quality, moderately effective against the sun.  I‚Äôm not a big fan of sunglasses of this color but they do fit great, and they seem to be made of good quality materials."
4.0,"I have two of these. Good sunglasses, wrap snugly around your dome. Seem to be well made for the price. You will notice a slight plastic small at times. Depending upon your level of sensitivity to such smells, this could or could not be a problem for you."
4.0,Very comfortable I would buy another one
4.0,"The j-style top straps are a little looser than the normal style, making them a little floppier. If you have larger feet, this might not be an issue. Still have great support."
4.0,I absolutely love these necklaces. The only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because you can't choose the one you want. I ordered 3 in one order and received 2 of the same.
4.0,"I have a few clothing items made from merino wool that I use for camping/backpacking.  It's not as scratchy as other wools - soft like cotton, but still with the warmth and water-resistance one expects from wool.  I prefer 100% merino wool stuff - socks + base layer - for cold weather camping.<br /><br />These socks are a merino wool-synthetic blend.  They are still soft and weather-resistant but not especially warm.  It's honestly hard to distinguish them from the cotton-poly moisture-wicking Hanes socks I've got in my drawer, at least in terms of fit and feel.<br /><br />Short story:  I can't say anything bad about these socks, but these aren't for cold weather."
4.0,It fits somewhat small. Not tiny but it looks baggy in the photo. The one I got which I believe was &#34;one size only&#34; fits like a regular tshirt. A little disappointing but I still like it and wear it a lot.
4.0,5‚Äô3‚Äù 107lbs got a size small. It‚Äôs a little big on the thighs but still wearable. Thin material but will serve its purpose for a one day use
4.0,"I bought this because I really like pockets!  Hate carrying a purse.  This dress fills the bill with pockets inside pockets.  Can carry my phone, keys, wallet, lipstick, etc.  and no purse!  Don't think I'll ever use the small pocket on the back though."
4.0,"Good work shirts, not over-priced, durable."
4.0,"Watch is exactly as described in the description. The light is kind of dim, and illuminates from the hour side, so it can be hard to see the minutes/seconds if it's still light enough where you are. The band is comfortable, however it slips all over my wrist and if I go any tighter, the watch is too tight. But such is a wrist band made to be universal."
4.0,Plan to wear for my son's wedding in September
4.0,Slightly larger and longer than expected. Material is on the thinner and shiny side. Overall I‚Äôm happy with it.
4.0,Its very pretty but just a touch small.  Fits like a smaller large.
4.0,This glasses is nice looking and fits good too. I bought just to have and I am not disappointed in it.
4.0,"Cute dress! I'm 5'6"" and 170lbs, and a Large fit! I was nervous that the sleeves would be tight for my arms, but the lace is stretchy."
4.0,"Lovely inexpensive watch & the band is really thick real leather. Short battery life though, may have to purchase battery as well lol"
4.0,Granddaughter was very pleased with her rings!
4.0,"I ordered 2 pair of these for my 2 granddaughters in both colors. I got 2 pair of the same color the pink. I was quite disappointed I was going to return one pair for the peach color but in was then unavailable. My granddaughters are 5&6 and both wear a size 1 which makes it hard to tell who‚Äôs shoes they are. My one granddaughter wore to left shoes to school one day very frustrating because of wrong color sent. The girls like these shoes they can put the on themselves, cute to wear with dresses or pants/shorts and can run and play in them. They are true to size and durable."
4.0,"Texture feels halfway between full grain leather and suede. Like the red and green thread in the stitching. The brown color is rich. Like the connectors being stainless steel and the buckle being black to match the edge-coating on the straps (as shown in photos). Very stiff, but easy to flex the band, so eventually it will lay comfortably around my wrist."
4.0,I really like this it is a nice accessory to have. I like that it's not too bright of a gold color but more of a bronze/copper color.
4.0,Cycling.
4.0,Decent for price. The compasses aren't too accurate.
4.0,"So far, so good. I took the advice of other reviewers and purchased a size up. In fact, because I'm top-heavy but short, I ordered 2 sizes up to an XL to be sure. The gamble paid off as this dress has just enough fabric left over to drape very nicely.<br /><br />As to the reported transparancy of the fabric, my only comment in that regard is this; slips never go out of style. They are the perfect fashion accessory and s/b worn every time you wear a dress."
4.0,My son loves it. Great quality. I was a little irritated that the tag on it was priced like $15 less than what I paid for it.
4.0,"I love the fit, the stretch and overall comfort of 90 Degree Leggins. they are so soft and stay-put.  However, there a seam unraveling on the inside of the right leg already (I've only worn/washed them twice) - so not sure how long these will last. :("
4.0,Really good quality shoe and cute. They are pretty narrow so keep that in mind.
4.0,"I received the Large size for review and though I can wear it, it fits one of my teens better.  I washed it in a mesh bag in the washing machine and laid it flat to dry.  It did o.k. and I didn't notice any shrinking but it did wrinkle up a little bit.  The material is good, but not super fantastic.  I don't know if it will last very long or not, but it looks really good with a pair of jeans.  The neckline is kind of low so she has to wear something under it to keep everything safely covered.  The sleeves are long enough that she can cuff them back.  When I tried it on I had to leave the sleeves uncuffed since I have orangutan length arms."
4.0,No reason to not like! They are doing an awesome job taking care of my 10 yo son's crowd and music noise sensitivity. Very sporty design and so glad I purchased these.
4.0,"Smaller than I realized, but my mom loves them. Got them for one of her Christmas presents."
4.0,These are so convenient to carry onto a store and use. The colors are awesome and you don‚Äôt have to worry about collecting piles of plastic bags when you grocery shop.
4.0,"No complaints except for the snap on the outside keeps coming undone. Otherwise, perfect. :)"
4.0,"For serious outdoor, all-day sun protection I wear a boonie-style hat, with a wide brim on all sides and drop-down neck protection. But the outback look doesn't really cut it for day-to-day activities around town or in the city, so I decided to go with something a little lower-profile. This baseball-style cap fits the bill. The bill itself is generously long and wide, and the neck flap tucks discreetly into a zippered pocket when not in use. The mesh in the cap keeps the noggin from getting too hot and sweaty. Two very minor quibbles. First, the fit runs a little small; the large feels a tad snug on my 23&#34; head, and it's not adjustable. Second, I would've liked the neck flap to be a bit longer. But the value for the price is excellent, and it suits its purpose. While it won't win any fashion awards, it'll provide functional, comfortable sun protection for occasions where the Indiana Jones look would be over-the-top."
4.0,Love this hat and socks are high quality. Fits a little tight but not bad.
4.0,"I haven't worn this yet, it is very delicate and I'm not sure it is me but I do like it."
4.0,"These tights are not sheer, they are about as black as normal black tights would be. Tights fit well, although one of mine did snag fairly easy. I wish they were a little more stretchy, but they get the job done. I would reccomend this product and I would purchase again."
4.0,Fits well and is comfortable but the turtle neck is not what I would actually describe as a turtle neck. It's loose and slouchy like a cowl neck.
4.0,Received in a timely manner. Was exactly how it was represented in the advertisement.
4.0,"Love the way this fits- true to size, decent quality (the underwire started to pop out almost immediately), and really cute."
4.0,10 year old likes them. Still look good after a few months which is amazing.
4.0,"Bought these for my wife. She loves them. Soft and comfortable. Only complaint, the finger stitching came out after a months use."
4.0,"Great material, nice and soft. Ordered a men's small it was slightly on the small size..I am 5ft. 7.5 inches tall and weigh 128 pounds..great price point for sweatshirt..ordered pink and the girls gave me a lot of compliments..not too pink..wish they made more colors"
4.0,Pretty nice especially at this price point! Arrived much sooner than estimated.
4.0,Super cute tee!!!
4.0,Very warm but the inside ‚Äúcap‚Äù is smaller and doesn‚Äôt allow you to wear it different ways.
4.0,"First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. These Square Dangle Earrings are gorgeous, they have a nice weight but not heavy. The material looks like quality and feels like quality. They are easy to put on and close but, I do wish the posts were a little more thicker. Other than that these are a pretty nice pair of Earrings."
4.0,Wish they were all black.
4.0,"Para el precio esta ok. Buen articulo para hacer ejercicio pero es un poco mas peque√±o que el tama√±o que deber√≠a de ser aproximadamente un size, si utiliza m√©dium ordene large. La calidad de la tela regular."
4.0,"Not sure what the price of these are at the time of posting this review.<br /><br />These socks are thin, but not too thin where they feel cheap. I do really like the print of these and the ribbing/compression at the arch. They also contain some silicone slip parts on the back.<br /><br />I don't think I'd pay over, say,$6 for this single pair of socks. And that's being generous, they're okay, but also not what id say are very high quality socks."
4.0,"The band looks exactly as advertised. But, it runs a little bit big. I have small wrists."
4.0,"This is a really cute accessory set that I ordered after finding a blue and white version in a department store.  The headband is stretchy and broad (about 3/4""), so I don't feel it digs into my baby's head the same way thinner head bands might.  My only complaints would be regarding the lack of consistency in product size and the packaging.  The headband is larger in diameter than the one in the same set I bought in the department store.  I have to tie a little knot in the back so my baby can wear it right now.  Also, both the headband and socks are attached to the display card by a sticky, glue strip.  I live in Houston, TX so when the package was left on my doorstep in 97+ degree heat, the glue left a sticky residue on both the headband and socks when I peeled them off the card.  For the socks, it's not a big deal because they can be washed.  But I don't know if you can put the headband in the washing machine without ruining it.  My suggestion to the manufacturers of this product: use the little plastic cords to attach your products to the packaging, NOT glue!<br /><br />Other than that, I would recommend this set to others.  And if you're looking for other cute headbands, Ema Jane makes a bunch of cute ones for babies and little girls.  I bought the [[ASIN:B0090OM1F4 Ema Jane - Mini Satin Mesh Hair Flowers Glued to Iridescent Skinny Headbands (18 Pack)]] and [[ASIN:B009HJFEHO Ema Jane - Vintage Feather Chiffon Rosette Pearl Centered Flower Hair Glued to Skinny Stretchy Headbands (8 Pack)]] and really love them!"
4.0,Hat is warm but slightly large for me.
4.0,Sizing fits true to size the hole in the cleavage is a little larger than I would have liked but other then that's very beautiful
4.0,"Great product, very functional with lots of area for many pieces of jewelry.  Some longer chains need to be doubled so as not to drag.  Top round area stores many bracelets.  The base is heavy enough."
4.0,"This was a gift because I already have one and it has been the best storage of my jewelry when traveling. No more knotted chains! Would love to see it in a metal, locking case, but for the $$, it is close to perfect."
4.0,"This swimsuit is beautiful! The colors are even brighter than pictured. However, the sizing is quite off. It is a tight fitted suit. I ordered a medium and a large because I wasn‚Äôt sure of the size. Glad I did because the large fits perfect! So order a size up. Maybe even two, if you don‚Äôt like the tight fit.  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weigh 140 if that helps."
4.0,"These silver chains look nice on the handcrafted pendants I create. They seem to hold up well - I haven't seen any of them break or kink. The clasps are a little weird, though. The hole that you insert the lobster claw part into isn't quite wide enough to accommodate the wider part of the clasp, so when the clasp is fastened it doesn't lay entirely flat. It's not a deal-breaker, though. These are quite nice for the price."
4.0,"Dress is a cheap material, and is somewhat stretchy. As another reviewer said, it's more like a bathing suit material. Also, it's more of a red orange than a holiday red. For the price, though, it's not bad, and is good for a fun Christmas party."
4.0,"The glove has a warm feel to it.  The thumbs are a bit harder to get in and out of, but once in they stay pretty warm.  I have been wearing the gloves in the 15-25 degree F range this past week.  This product just does what is advertized."
4.0,"The ring was more beautiful than I ever expected. I've had it for almost 2 months and have lost three little studs on the sides. I'm really upset about that but what am I to do. Other than the studs falling out, it's a beautiful gift. Delivered on time."
4.0,"I have been wearing them for about two weeks now and have no problems.  As in my last pair of Tamaracks, a drop of  super glue will keep the laces tied ."
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous! True to size and vibrant colors. I like the different patterns in the material (chest vs. skirt). The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars it is because it is a big long. This dress fits right above the knees making it look a tad weird on me and I am not that short I am 5'7"" I will be taking it in a few inches to make it look better.<br />You can wear this with a bandeau to support the boobs, the chest is loose enough to wear it without for those who'd prefer not to wear one.<br />Material is thin and light but not see-through. It has two strings one on the chest and another one at waste-line; both are not functional but more for looks.<br /><br />Definitely recommended. I love the print and color!"
4.0,Boys love the shoes. Smooth transaction would buy again.
4.0,"I bought this is a birthday gift for my 14 year old daughter. Other than the chain, it was very well made. The chain bends easily and can possibly kink. It was worth the price and my daughter was very happy with it."
4.0,"I love this set , so cute and comfy .. perfect for casual outings with the girls. Fits really nice ‚Äî it is a bit long that‚Äôs my only critique."
4.0,"it took me 6 weeks to receive it. the quality is OK, and the item is pretty much the same as what's shown in the picture."
4.0,"The backside could be a little more roomy, (I have am average sized backside) but other than that great quality and they provide excellent compression. I found they are easy to put on. The ribbing may bother some people but I didn't mind it."
4.0,Arrived quickly and good quality tie for the price and has a very light tie feel comparable to wearing a silk tie.
4.0,Thicker than expected. Button holes too small making it difficult to button. Looser fit than I wanted.  Just stiff fitting.
4.0,"Love, love! This swimsuits is so cute on. The cup was slightly big as I am smaller chested, but overall fit well. Some swimwear does not compliment even think shapes, however this is very flattering. The pink color is great!"
4.0,I‚Äôm a smallish woman and this visor was big for me. I have to wrap the Velcro almost to the beyond point (if that makes sense) to get it to fit  But not worth returning for the price. I might play around with replacing the Velcro with elastic.
4.0,Not bad they not solid really soft
4.0,"Decent quality for the price, fast shipping! Over all nice bag.."
4.0,The item does not lay flat on skin. You have to keep pulling it down in the back.
4.0,"Super cute outfit fit the baby perfectly, the glitter on the shirt was fine and did not rub off, the glitter on the hat, totally different story, it was everywhere. Other than all the glitter though this was exactly what I had wanted."
4.0,"Material is kind of thin, but I like it, and I'd order in other colors."
4.0,"This dress is a great cut. Because of the material, it's not for formal wear, instead, it's more casual and/or office wear. The fabric is thinner than I expected. The price is reasonable enough so I figured it's not going to be made of thick material. It also wrinkles easily."
4.0,"I wanted to be able to make quick smoothies with veg and fruit as well as some powder supplements that I take daily and this blender makes it super easy and quick to have a delicious smoothie any time of the day. The charge on it will last a handful of blends but you will need to charge it often if used daily. I recently used it to blend homemade tomatoe sauce and blend a brazilian quick bread and I have to say it worked well though the bread mixture did get a little thick it handled it best it could. If you are unsure of buying this product, don't hesitant! Its great for quick easy use. I am happy with mine. Best 35 bucks ive ever spent on amazon."
4.0,Beautiful. A must have.
4.0,"these are really cute with boots.  Bought these for my daughter.  She's small, so they worked fine for her, but they would be snug on my lady legs."
4.0,It is warm and super comfortable.  Love the zip pockets . Color is a bit faded at the seams though.
4.0,"Very nice hat, but didn‚Äôt fit my son"
4.0,"These fit great and feel great. Squat proof. Did hot yoga in them I will say they stayed exceptionally damp post yoga, draw back for me."
4.0,I like that you put the straps in pockets and carry like luggage. I don't like that the straps are a little tricky to get them lay smooth  in the pockets.
4.0,Dresse size run a bit small and is longer then I expected but its very pretty and good quality material
4.0,Pinches if resting your wrist on the edge of something like a  Steering wheel.
4.0,"Very nice, well worth the money paid for them. The person they were given to enjoyed them greatly, then turned into a jerk. The cufflinks were wonderful though and they were delivered as described and on time."
4.0,Too big size.
4.0,Works okay but not exactly what I expected.
4.0,This bra does the job even in high activity such as zumba class. The straps are comfortable too and do not cut into shoulders.
4.0,"It is a nice band, seems to be good quality and smells like real leather. I would like the band length to be a little bit longer and the buckle to be more polished but that's not a complaint about the product."
4.0,It's not see through. I am 4'11&#34; and weighs 130 lbs. It is a little long for me because I am short. It is nice light blue color and I wish it comes with different ways on how to style it.
4.0,Some colors fit well and others not. I am 5'3&#34; 120lbs and ordered XLarge.
4.0,It is a nice looking jacket. But be aware that it run small. I am 1.75' tall and weight 165 LBS and ordered a Medium size and it did not fit well.
4.0,So cute but broke the 1st time worn.
4.0,"This is a really pretty dress. I ordered it in dusky rose, but the color received has a light purple tint, closer to lavender. I did not mind this. I am 5'6, 139 lbs, mom with a straight, athletic build. I ordered a medium and it fit nicely, if a tad loose, which would have been comfortable. However, no one has a picture posted of themselves with the length of this dress in proper view, so if you are interested, I posted some pics. The third picture is of myself, having plopped down on the bench without any tug-and-wiggle adjustment to keep the dress down. The underslip is quite short! For this reason I had to return it, knowing I would be uncomfortable worrying about someone getting flashed should I hastily bend over when wearing the dress all day attending a family wedding. Sad. I wish I would have been able to think of a way to extend the underslip, but it is sewn down.  If this is not an issue for you, go for it. The dress is lovely, the lace is delicate but un-fussy, and it is quite comfortable."
4.0,"Fast shipping, good fit, and very stylish. Much better than your typical nondescript sunglasses strap. Can't wait to hear those compliments."
4.0,I don't know ... It's a polishing cloth ...  It a cloth you use to polish ... OK?  How do you rate that?
4.0,"I ordered this on Dec. 26th and it finally arrived on Jan. 8th. Not quite my idea of &#34;fast&#34; delivery. Then, when it arrived, one of the eyes had fallen out of it. I located the eye in the small cellophane bag and glued it back in--a process that required tweezers and some dental glue I had sitting around. Despite that, I love it. I wear it on the middle finger of my left hand. Don't know how long that will last since I haven't worn any rings for years. I don't feel good complaining since it was so inexpensive."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet!  Just don‚Äôt wear it in the shower or pool because it will rust.
4.0,"Both the necklace and bracelet lobster claws seem to need 'oiling' (for lack of a better term).<br /><br />I cannot put the bracelet on w/o someone's help; just using my left thumb nail to try and open the 'claw' laid on top of my right wrist just doesn't work because the claw is so 'tight'.<br /><br />The design is very cool, and I love that the extension portion of the chain is long enough to give a wide range of length options, depending on the cut of the shirt or dress neckline I'm wearing at the time.<br /><br />This would look FANTASTIC on a high cut solid colored sweater.<br /><br />I also like that the ring can be opened and closed, depending on how swollen my finger happens to be.  This adjustment capability also means I am not limited to always wearing it on the same finger every time.<br /><br />That said, the top of the ring (the circle/swirl) is slightly larger in diameter than I would prefer it be... Then again, I do have exceptionally long, narrow fingers.<br /><br />Highly recommend!"
4.0,"Works, but cheaply made. You get what you pay for. Lightweight and smaller than 2 inches. Broke a couple already. Spend a little more for a more sturdy product but they do work for light duty."
4.0,Bigger than I anticipated.
4.0,Gorgeous bag but so disappointed with the chain strap that why only 4 stars. Its an ugly orange copper color....I wish I could have taken it off but it‚Äôs not removable. Returned :(
4.0,"My foot is a 7,5-8W size, but the socks were an inch bigger thatn I expected. The material is nice, the design is crazy cool!"
4.0,"I love these leggings. It‚Äôs hard for me to find leggings and pants that fit my inseam because I‚Äôm short and have short legs. I‚Äôm 5ft 2in with a 25‚Äù - 26‚Äù inseam. These hit my ankle! I love the thick stretchy fabric and the price. I purchased in black and burgundy. Love the colors, they‚Äôre not faded. They are almost fully not see through, but you can see an underwear line a little if you‚Äôre climbing or doing a similar sport. They‚Äôre warm too. One of the black leggings is flawed. The right leg is about an inch longer than the left, but I don‚Äôt care, haha. It‚Äôs only noticeable if you look really close, but I plan to wear socks over it. Definitely one of the best leggings I‚Äôve owned and can‚Äôt beat that price!<br />For reference: purchased size medium. I‚Äôm a size 29 in jeans. Was looking for leggings since I gave birth two months ago."
4.0,Cute. Dark. But could be darker. Good size. Large as expected and what I wanted. Will order another pair.
4.0,"Is it leather or bonded leather?I don't know. It looks good, has quick release pins and I found the buckle and the pin, also called ardillon,  feels solid. Next time I'm replacing a watch strap, i'd consider this company again."
4.0,"The fabric is a little on the thin side but it is not sheer. It‚Äôs soft, comfy and a little oversized. It‚Äôs also nice and long which is great but it can get a little bit wrinkly. I washed it on delicate and hung it to dry to help alleviate this. You also have to take the time to re-fold the sleeves. Overall it‚Äôs a nice shirt and looks good on."
4.0,Great price and look for real leather.
4.0,"Fits but tight,very good quality."
4.0,I bought these to replace pajama pants I wore last Christmas. My last ones tore apart after just a month of use. These are a bit better quality but I don't expect them to last much longer than my last. The material is soft and comfortable but not very durable.
4.0,"I bought this in black and it's incredibly comfortable to wear; it's also very versatile - I wore it with black tights and a statement necklace for work but it would be equally good to wear with leggings and a scarf on the weekend.  I'm short - 5'1&#34; - and the dress came a bit below my knees, which is a length I like.  The fabric is a little thin and I haven't washed it yet, but I like it enough that I plan to buy it in additional colors."
4.0,The size is too large.  I returned and ordered a smaller size which is still roomy.  I like the length which is above my knees.  It‚Äôs OK for a sleep wear so I keep it!
4.0,gave to a friend that loves them.  I couldn't use them due to edema swelling being way too much for these socks
4.0,"Super cute and comfy little outfit! Fits true to size. The bow is poorly made, so I just use my own."
4.0,"Comfortable to wear but there is a little bit of a sizing issue. Bottom was a little tight and the chest area is very loose. Besides that, great swimsuit and comfortabke to wear."
4.0,It's cute.i thought it was denim but not.very mini...
4.0,Very nice. Lightweight. Form fitting so went a size larger. Was too big. Fit was to actual size.
4.0,"They work for RX lens and I am using them now, with my lens and received many compliments about how they look from other seniors! They<br />are excellent for pop out lens, such as the ones I have!"
4.0,Arrived just as pictured. Love it. Did take a long time to ship.
4.0,Good quality but it fits a little weird. I don't know if it is sewn crooked but it wants to ride to one side just a little.
4.0,it fell apart I fixed it
4.0,"After reading the sizing reviews I decided to go up a size, and it's perfect! I normally wear a 6 bottoms and for a top like this 36C, so I ordered the medium (8-10). Very pretty and comfortable."
4.0,"Good for what it is. Yes, it is cheap but you know that upfront as it costs 1/3-1/2 of what other, more well known, brands cost. Yes, it will cut the bands quickly but this is easily remedied with a bit of sandpaper and about 3 minutes to smooth the edges in the groove where the band sits. Yes, the sharp edges on the corners could case wear in a pocket but once again, 5 minutes with some sandpaper can remedy this. Yes, it will not hold a lot of cards or bills but what's the point of a minimalist wallet if you want to carry a lot of stuff.  If you want to carry a lot of cards, bills and receipts, this is not what you want. If you don't want to take 10 minutes of time to smooth the edges , this is not what you want. If you want a minimalist wallet of this style that is made of aluminum, steel, titanium or carbon fiber, this is not what you want and don't expect to get one for what this one costs. If you are willing to spend 10 minutes to smooth the edges and use this wallet to carry no more than it is really intended to carry, it will work well."
4.0,"For the price that I paid for this item, it is worth it so far as long as the CZ's don't fall out.  It's very VERY thin.  A little tinier than I thought it would be but still very pretty.  No complaints so far."
4.0,"Watch look great, packing was superb, delivery was prompt, watch fir the price is indeed elegant.  However, the adjustment for seconds need attention which is very lose and find it bit shaky to adjust to right time."
4.0,"I bought this as a costume and decided to keep it as a dress instead. This dress is so comfortable and cute. I don't  think it looks vintage, but it fits nicely, looks classy and is a perfect above the knee length."
4.0,"These are cute and fit nice, ride a little but sexy"
4.0,Great color & size.  Wish it had a coin pouch would have given 5 stars.
4.0,Like the leggings; hate the dye smell. Have to wash and air before wearing.
4.0,"This is a very nice charm, it fit to my friends charm bracelet perfectly, though it does have a slight downside.<br /><br />The charm arrived in a small microfiber bag which was nice, and a good way to store it for gifting. It looked great and the paint on the charm seemed to be well done (no chips, peeling, etc). It does have one downside though - a serial number.<br /><br />While this is a well fitting and well made product the charm does have a serial number emblazoned on the back of its head. This isn't really a problem from a distance but if you inspect the charm close up you may see the bold numbers and letters of a serial number. My friend, who wears the charm now, says that it isn't a big deal as they don't really notice it and that if you show it to someone they only can really see the face. But if very you're concerned about the aesthetics this may be a slight issue.<br /><br />Overall though I've heard that the charm held up well and still looks great, because of this overall I feel this is a good product for those that like Pluto in your life"
4.0,"It‚Äôs better quality than I expected! I got the houndstooth polyester one and I didn‚Äôt know if it would be one layer or two. Thankfully it is double layer (I don‚Äôt wear bras so I appreciated the extra coverage).<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 145 lb., small chest, medium/short torso. The medium size is nearly too short but otherwise it fits. Very hard to snap because it‚Äôs not that stretchy, but once I got it on it was comfortable for hours.<br /><br />A couple other notes: The bottom is a ‚Äúcheeky‚Äù fit on me, not at all full coverage (40‚Äù hips). And the long sleeves are reasonably long which is great. I hate when sleeves don‚Äôt quite reach my wrist."
4.0,I like it..but the top is smaller and tighter than the bottom. I had to stretch out the top to match up a little
4.0,Beautiful and super soft. Looks great with dark pair of Jean's paired with boots or even cute shoes.
4.0,These bracelets are really nice for the price.  They even came in a nice pouch.  I got them for my Grandsons for Easter.
4.0,"I ordered this dress for a formal Christmas party. After reading the reviews, I ordered a medium which is a size up from what I usually wear. It fit perfectly, and the length went down right above my shoes when I was wearing heels (I'm 5'4). Material is cheap, but that is to be expected for the price you pay! Love it!"
4.0,"oh man!  where was this dress pre-breast reduction!  it is definitely great for size D and above.  I am a C/D and there lots of room to fill.  it's a fantastic look - super retro and classic, with a great shape and fun features.  i am not 100% thrilled with the material in that's not the highest end.  but it does offer a decent amount of stretch for comfortable and additional space.  it is a super cool dress with a great look - will be a lot of fun and a great conversation piece for the right shape"
4.0,Not what I wanted but they keep my hands warm
4.0,Cute shoes! I have a very high arches on my feet so either way I have to buy arch support insoles. Other than that they are cute! I haven't worn them around yet so I'm not sure on comfortable they are but they seem like they would last awhile w/o pain.
4.0,"Perfect fit! Color was more royal blue than navy, but it‚Äôs still great with denim."
4.0,"It fita pretty well, except for the hood, which is on the small size."
4.0,"So I adjusted my weight because I‚Äôm around 7.5 months pregnant‚Ä¶ I have obviously gained weight in my thighs and in my hips and belly, so I sized up to XL‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad I did because they‚Äôre a little tight around the thighs‚Ä¶ their material is buttery soft but also very stretchy‚Ä¶ with that being said, you can definitely see my flaws in the teal color‚Ä¶<br />I have the ColorfulKoala joggers in black and really like the material of those because they‚Äôre not as slick as these and their large fits like these XL do‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get me wrong I really like these joggers, but for XL I was hoping for a looser fit through the thigh and leg‚Ä¶ maybe I can stretch them out a tad"
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of earrings I could wear all the time, (even to bed) and these work pretty good.<br />They are very thin so I hope they hold up. But for the price I think they will be OK!"
4.0,"A little smaller than I really wanted, but nice quality."
4.0,"This children's apron and chef hat is made of sturdy material and arrived very fast.  The only thing I didn't like was the flat hat, the picture shows a taller top and wider front brim.  The apron is perfect!"
4.0,These seemed to be good quality. I am 5'8 120lb (usually size 4) so I ordered a small but I didn't like the tightness around the waist- created unflattering bumps. Waiting for my mediums to come in. My goal is for them to lay there nicely without any or much squeeze..
4.0,"This shirt runs small, I bought and wear a medium this shirt was very snug i returned it hoping that the leg is going to be big enough."
4.0,"The Skirt is just cute, endless style options, &#34;annnnd&#34; with pockets?jus  Nice! Double compliments , when wearing this. I'm 5/1 got a large  usually im a 12/14 . woman of color with coke bottle measurements ,u might have to squeeze, into it  pass our hips and butt. I just pulled from the elastic n switch side 2,side with a Lil hop , lol till it got pass the butt. Then its fine ,I didn't want to pull it over my head cause its a skirt. and I'm boobie ,so I would have same problem. Other then that the skirt is awesome, an xl would be to big."
4.0,"The bag itself is very roomy and can fit at least 4 regular sized bath towels as well as small items like sunscreen, keys, etc. The reason I give it 4 stars is that the bottom cold compartments leaks badly. For a beach item, they should have made the bottom cooler water-tight as some folks like their beverages on ice and will use the ice in the cooler in the drink. The first time use was a bit of a disaster as the bag got covered in wet sand due to it leaking. Now I only use cold packs and we no longer use this for the beach. I now use it as a grocery bag, for bringing home frozen foods in the bottom and other items on top."
4.0,No era la misma descripci√≥n
4.0,"Nice strong frames, polarized for highlighted vision-especially while driving and comes in a nice sleek carrying case. I personally like these better on my husbands framed face better than my rounded face, but a nice pair at a decent price."
4.0,"The sunnies are very cute and comfy and seem to be great quality for the price. The case that‚Äôs included is a cool bonus but the case I got was damaged. All in all, I‚Äôm very pleased with these."
4.0,"Excellent balaclava.  My only complaint is that it isn't windproof at all.  But if you wear this under a hat/helmet, it'll keep you quite toasty indeed.  The face mask's versatility is appreciated, the fit is nice and snug, the material is high quality."
4.0,good fit and nice to wear in hot conditions
4.0,I love them all however the rubbery plastic backs ALWAYS fall off. I had to dig and dig and dig to find backs that would keep them on all day. Perfect the backs and I would literally buy every pair made!
4.0,Loved the dress but it was too tight in the arms. I'll have to send it back.
4.0,Cute tie-dye cover up.
4.0,Fabric is a little thin and shows all the bumps. Thank the gods for Spanx
4.0,Just kinda dinky. Cute tho
4.0,Needed this for my daughters galaxy party. She usually wears 7-8 and we got her the medium. She said it feels a little tight. Besides that looks great for a one time occasion
4.0,Smaller than I was hoping for... but barely... but nice quality
4.0,"Nice ring.  Very pretty.  I like that it is adjustable.  My only criticism is that when the ring is worn for long periods of time, you skin turns green where the ring touches.  Not sure what to do about that particular issue other than not wearing the ring more than a few hours at a time."
4.0,It is a little tight in the bust and a little large in the waist. Could not have been able to get a larger size. I think I will be able to wear it.
4.0,"Excellent for the price. The pins and the connectors at the end of the band were a little cheap, but it was perfect for what I wanted."
4.0,It‚Äôs too long .
4.0,"I like the product. However I followed the suggestion of another review related to size.<br />I am a 35 waist and 36 inseam and a LARGE is to to small, a XXL would fit properly."
4.0,"Beautiful bag, bougie on a budget."
4.0,The zipper is a little tough for my daughter. I worry she will break it off. But other than that it‚Äôs a nice coat at a good price that keeps her warm!
4.0,"There are plenty of pockets. Take note of the ones that aren't sealed at the bottom: I keep things like cough drops in there. The zipper pocket feels more secure for coins. There's plenty of room for cards, cash and so forth. I clip my keys to the same place where the cross-body strap is attached (or can be detached if you want to simply use the wrist loop for carrying). The tassel is a good reminder of which way the purse should hang, so that I can show ID very easily and quickly. Everyone remarks on how chic it looks."
4.0,"Great product, especially for the price. Exactly as pictured. Beautiful rose gold polarized lenses"
4.0,"You‚Äôll need a little petticoat to make the skirt appear full like the picture and the lacing is slightly off but all in all, not bad for the price. Still cute."
4.0,Sweater is comfortable but the yellow color is not at all as expected. Fit and quality are good.
4.0,My daughter bought it for her and her bff. They love it!
4.0,The black part is uneven.
4.0,Good quality. I can't complain at all.
4.0,I was satisfied with this purchase.  The fabric was comfortable and the fit was perfect.
4.0,Great for extra keys
4.0,Solid quality for the money!
4.0,Nice size and feel to these earrings.
4.0,"Don't let the negative reviews change your mind! SUPER CUTE! I was looking for this shirt for a long time and I finally came across this. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and the shirt looked good/cute along with most of the reviews. I recommend this product but I would get a bigger size than you would think. Also, this is pretty CROPPED, and if your not really into that, then I would get this somewhere else or in a bigger size. If your into better material and better quality clothing like me, this is not the best material. All in all, the product is really cute and I would recommend it."
4.0,I love these small bags. The only thing I dont like is the plastic insert on the bottom of the bag. Things get under it and alot of the time I use the bag without it.
4.0,Did not have adjustable straps as advertised
4.0,This jacket is very light and perfect for travel. The color and fabric are great.  I haven't worn it in the rain yet.<br /><br />I bought a size up from my usual size and it's snug. Fine over a t-shirt but that's it. I wanted it for summer showers so it's fine for that.
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece of lingerie! The elastic in the waste is made to fit<br />more than just one size. So if you're ordering a large in hopes it will fit<br />xl, it will."
4.0,"Super cute dress, love the buttons!! The top portion is somewhat thin, but thicker in appropriate areas. The top is definitely small and will pull. I am a 36C and bought a large and it‚Äôs right on the edge of still being tight. The length is great and I‚Äôm excited to wear it this summer. Overall, exactly what I was looking for and it came super quick so I am happy!"
4.0,"Nice product, good fit."
4.0,Cute cover-up. Nothing fancy. Extra roomy
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b7954061aa4352debcddc27047333ca3]] I have worn these a few times and I have gotten many compliments. They are cute, and an easy ‚Äúgo to‚Äù for fall. I do like them!<br /><br />The sizing is right on, however, the toe box is a bit small. I was still able to wear the shoes comfortably but it was more so of an annoyance. Secondly, they are starting to crease already - I feel like it‚Äôs a bit soon to see this already."
4.0,"This underwear was really soft and comfortable to wear. I though I had found my favorite underwear, however after the maybe the 10th time wear them 2 of the 4 boxers began tearing at the seams. The threading along the seams came completely undone. The other 2 boxers haven‚Äôt had any issues (yet). It‚Äôs possible that I may of had a factory defect or just bad luck, but definitely considering reordering more as they were comfy."
4.0,"It is comfortable, has a second hand, and is durable."
4.0,"Definitely a nice shirt for the price, quality material, washes well."
4.0,"Rich color, comfortable fit, keeps time. I already have a lime green one that I found somewhere else, but needed a teal watch with silvertone highlights instead of gold. This fit the bill."
4.0,Comfy as good quality but not 100% cellulite friendly :)<br />But so versatile I bought a second pair
4.0,"Good quality, but run a little small for my 9.5 size feet"
4.0,"Being nearly 200 lbs. You want to still find a flattering swim suit, I feel confident wearing this with or without a cover up. Top is very light and flows, It is transparent but has layers and the bottom layer hugs like a tank top."
4.0,The deep luster of these pearls is amazing.  The overall weight and structure of the earrings is very well balanced.  These are a great buy for the price.
4.0,This is a beautiful bracelet! My friend loved it! Thankfully she had very petite wrists. It would not fit large wrists.
4.0,"As advertised, although not as slim fitting as pictured. It is a little expensive but the less expensive versions are really low quality."
4.0,Medium fits my petite daughter right mid calf and she looked great in it. It‚Äôs wrinkly straight from the bag but hopefully won‚Äôt be after washing. Stretchy material makes it comfy.
4.0,"I will say, while the color option does include green in the three color package, the pictures look like it‚Äôs white not green. The red and brown came as expected, though the green ended up being more of a teal blue in color which surprised me. Overall, not bad. It feels rather loose in the shoulder straps rather than a snug fit, but it does well for it‚Äôs job."
4.0,The skirt is a bit to small. Would need to wear leggings with it.
4.0,I like the strongest of the clip for your keys it's very sturdy and we'll made. The lanyerd is very cool looking with Disney on it and comfortable on your neck.
4.0,I have issues with needing a bigger top but smaller bottom so it fit as expected but bottoms were too big around the legs.  All in all a well made product.
4.0,Very unique style and perfect for any nurse in your life. Love the y-style as well. An ideal gift she will love.
4.0,"Love the Eagle, but chain was a bit thin is the only reason I did not rate it at a 5 star."
4.0,"I loved the look of the shirt, just sad that you cant choose a size.  I thought it was a one size fits all but when it arrived it was a medium.  I would order this again if I could choose the large size."
4.0,Very cute wallet. The texture on the outside is soft and smooth. The inside is perfect for cards and cash with a zipped pocket for that extra change.
4.0,A nice value. I am happy with the purchase.
4.0,This was an awesome gift. My daughter loved it. Just keep in mind it is like bathing suit/ thick pantyhose material? It snags pretty easy.
4.0,They look sharp.  Had the size adjusted and they fit well.  They don't slide on and off as easily as the original regular bands.
4.0,I like it is very nice
4.0,"Depending on how much you're trying to stretch your collar, these can be great or they can be uncomfortable they are in contact with your neck.  They absolutely do what they are supposed to do, but I've learned over time that they can't make up for having a shirt that is more than a certain about &#34;tight around the collar.&#34;"
4.0,NEED TO GET NEW  HEAD  MOLD
4.0,Pretty red..will work with so many outfits!!
4.0,"I purchased these cases to carry my sunglasses & eyeglasses.  I highly recommend them, fabric is sturdy, soft & opening is large."
4.0,I like these bands because they are nice and cool in the summer months. Also very sharp looking.
4.0,These fit fine. I wear a size 9 and they were comfortable and cute with my patent leather loafers.
4.0,Good product please with it
4.0,Light weight jacket not really a coat in my opinion. Really cute.
4.0,"I liked the print and the cut except for the high waist, which makes me look preggers. Why is it so hard to find dresses with a natural waist?? If you aren't skinny you look like you are with child ."
4.0,The way the ribbon tied and the way the pockets hit my hips is awkward (5ft 120lbs) but for the price I‚Äôll keep
4.0,"These are easy to put on my glasses and easy to adjust.  My only complaint is that after a few hours, the tops of my ears start to get a bit sore.  I think if the grabbers were a bit longer it would be okay.  The part that makes my ears sore is where the grabbers end...that edge is rubbing on my ear and irritating it.  Other than that, you don't even really see them when they are on.  The black strap is not overly large, and I have light brown hair.  It doesn't jump out and make a statement shouting, ""Hey look at me... I'm a NERD"" or anything like that  :)  They do very well keeping my glasses in place.  Overall I am pleased with these.  When I wear my mask at work, my glasses do want to slide a bit, and these have helped tremendously!"
4.0,"I love this dress. I followed the size chart and it fits perfectly! I am 5'8"", 215lbs, 38G. It drapes really well and the color is great. I am considering ordering another dress in a different size. The fabric is thick and feels nice - very soft. My only complaint is that after one wash, it has a tiny hole. I don't think it's worth returning the dress, and I can sew it (luckily it's not in an obvious spot) but I hope it's not a sign of things to come once i wash the dress more down the road. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to friends!"
4.0,This dress is really nice for the price. I bought it for my bachelorette and all my friends loved it. It‚Äôs not sheer anywhere but I didn‚Äôt try it with darker underwear. It‚Äôs also not super warm which is nice for going out.
4.0,"Good product, hate when toddler sucks don't have gripping bottoms, but there are pretty good got the price especially"
4.0,It's a little large on me I'm 5ft so it is to be expected. It's a very beautiful cover up and I will definitely wear it around the pool.
4.0,"They were on the shorter side, but I'm also 5'8"". If you have thick thighs they will ride up, but over all very comfortable."
4.0,"I like this product but after using it fir a while the magnetnts  on the air vent come off. I have had to hot glue it and pop it back in 3 times. But overall it‚Äôs a good product. I wish they sold the metal that sticks in to your phone as differentshapes. Something cuter other than a plain rectangle, that way it would look nice on your phone."
4.0,"First time Rocky boots for me, leather is not as thick as I thought it would be.  However, it's durable and comfortable pair of boots.  I get some type of discomfort from new boots but I am surprised that these pair of boots fit well and did not give me any pain.  A bit on pricey side, found another online business got them for $68 shipped but mine was already shipped and on it ways.  I do recommend these boots, very comfortable and if it last as long as some reviews have had I am in good shape.  I don't think I will ever destroy these as I have few other pairs of boots I rotate but if these are more comfortable than my other boots I maybe wearing these more."
4.0,It's cute runs a little large
4.0,Feels a little cheapo but is ok. Wish the pockets were more formed instead of 2 holes on the exact sides if your hips. Fits as described.
4.0,"Nice set. Excellent quality. My daughter's been using it since September and it's still in perfect condition. Was a bit disappointed when it arrived though, because I ordered the pink and received the black. Thankfully, my daughter was alright with it so I didn't have to go through the hassles of having it returned and exchanged."
4.0,"Good fabric, but the head bows are all different sizes.  If you can re-tie the bow, these are good so you can adjust to your baby's head size."
4.0,It's a nice looking casual dress watch. But you can tell that it was make with cheaper materials. Everything works as intended.  I'm ok with this purchase.
4.0,"Don't be fooled!  The plaid that is displayed is not a fabric, but vinyl which does not have a smooth fit and will probably lead to cracking because it is thinner and not as durable as the other material on the boot.  Overall, it has a great grip for walking on ice and snow... it keeps my feet warm and dry (which is the most important).  And, I have had several compliments about the look!"
4.0,The fabric is not very comfortable but it worked as a cute shirt.
4.0,"Great panty hose, but I noticed as soon as I put them on, there was a snag. I'm not sure if I did it myself or if it came like that. But still are nice panty hose and the snag isn't very noticeable."
4.0,doesn't fit very well for women with large breasts
4.0,"Fine quality, very good in the winter (it's wool, so warmer than it looks). The bill is not as stiff as a normal cap, but I was able to shape it with a rubber band/coffee mug. It sits a little lower on the head than I thought it would.<br /><br />But it's a good hat and was at the right price."
4.0,Loved the luxury look
4.0,"Cheap, but fun and cute."
4.0,This is a great flowing dress for summer days. The buttons don't close enough for privacy so I wear mine with silk liner underneath. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Hat arrived 3 days after order was placed. Average/good quality construction. Embroidery was a little crooked/ slightly off center, but believe this to be due to front seem of hat. Should not be a problem though."
4.0,Nice inexpensive bracelet
4.0,"I like them alot, if could change any thing would be to make reading glass part smaller so line between the two was lower in the glasses :-)<br />Great job!"
4.0,This was a Christmas gift to an aunt.  I received it at least a month before the holiday.  The stone itself was so pretty.  The only complaint I have is I wish you had the option to order the chain in a longer length.  (I had to separately order a longer chain).
4.0,The material fell nice looking good no complaints the only thing is you need to check your size real good my normal size is large  but in this shirt I am 5 xl so this shirt run  small so check you size real good  I recommend nice material  love good I hope I help with this review please check mark helpful  thanks
4.0,Well packed to protect it while shipping. Very affordable and fits a medium sized head.
4.0,"Not the right,l have purchase.l purchase 4 colors mask & i received black color only mask"
4.0,I loved the fit of this romper. The quality is good and I love the fit. I'm petite 5ft and the length is good. My only complaint is it is really hard to get on and off. Makes restroom breaks time consuming. In my opinion it looks great with or without a belt.
4.0,This dress is flattering.  Arms are a little tight but my arms are big.  I hope it comes out of the wash well.
4.0,Great for comfort
4.0,"I ordered the gray with blue glasses.It is very stylish and has a good fit.I have a small face so it looks little big on my face but it fits great on my husband.Quality and the make seems to be very sturdy.It will be great for Outdoor activities,running,jogging or water sports since it fits really well on your face.<br /> I received this item at discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,Surprisingly this dress fits me just fine. I am 5'2&#34; and weight about 120. Pear shape.
4.0,Look big in Picture  but very small
4.0,Great pair of joggers! Feels like leggings - not super warm but high waisted like leggings with a jogger fit! Runs TTS - ordered a small :-)
4.0,"I purchased this bag at a local B&amp;M store for a week long trip I am planning to take to a tropical climate.  As fall is finally here it is hard to find a purse that still has a 'summer vibe' to it.  This bag is spacious and should have no trouble holding all my daily essentials for around town shopping and beach wear.<br /><br />WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS BAG<br />‚Ä¢ Fun beachy colors<br />‚Ä¢ Incredibly spacious (13-1/2&quot; W x 15&quot; H x 5-1/4&quot; D)<br />‚Ä¢ Easy to pack as it stores completely flat<br />‚Ä¢ Long handles (8&quot;) that are convenient for carrying by hand or over the shoulder<br />‚Ä¢ Long adjustable shoulder strap (18&quot;)<br />‚Ä¢ Backslip pocket on outside of bag<br />‚Ä¢ Interior hanging zip pocket with 2 slip pockets<br />‚Ä¢ Luxuriously soft leather<br /><br />WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED<br />‚Ä¢ No way to securely close top of bag<br />‚Ä¢ Tote lacks structure<br />‚Ä¢ No lining<br />‚Ä¢ Only available in summer colors<br />‚Ä¢ No protective feet on the bottom of the tote<br /><br />The top of the bag can be closed with the attached leather tie closure which -while it looks cute - is not completely secure.  As it lacks a firm structure the tote has a tendency to fall over when put down, especially when not filled.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy this bag.  I wish it was available in some fall colors as well.  While I purchased this tote at full price, I expect (or would hope) the price will come down as we are nearing fall.  Would recommend!"
4.0,"This is a great product, in the net u cannot tell how big it is, is really big but if u are a real collector is excellent it works perfect and it keeps ur automatic watchs perfectly on time."
4.0,This shoe is very supportive and comfortable.
4.0,"One of the butterfly backs wouldn't work - no hole punched through it.  But there are 2 pairs of silicone backs included also, and those work okay.  I don't know how long those will last, though.  Otherwise, these aren't bad for the price."
4.0,"I have no complaints, i was a bit concerned at first. I figured it would be s***ty quality considering the price, however it wasnt. It has a very long chain that goes around my head easily. There are no snaps but there doesnt really need to be."
4.0,"Really pretty print! Fit well. Unfortunately, really uncomfortable especially in the back - something about the band that cuts across your back, drives me a little bit crazy. BUT I still wear it occasionally because I love how it looks."
4.0,"I love them. They're a bit narrow for my wide feet, but I'm sure they'll break in to the perfect fit."
4.0,Ned's wife: they're very soft. Seem sturdy but I don't know how durable they are. I go w/o shoes in the house so I'm hard on socks. I don't know if bamboo is more durable or less so - will soon find out.
4.0,"These sandals held up well through my daughters adventures during the summer. They did need to have the velcro replaced but this is more due to brush getting stuck in them while my daughter played. They lasted the entire summer and are still sturdy.  I love the toe protection. The design comes as pictured, cute and did  not fade. They did not pinch her feet or make blisters."
4.0,"Haven't used it yet, but it fits as expected.  Pants are a little longer than what I would prefer, but that's a common issue that I have found"
4.0,"This mask has a gorgeous, vibrant print and is incredibly soft. It is large enough that it covers everything you need it to, but not so large that it falls down. The elastics are comfortable on your ears and are adjustable, which is great. The main problem I had with it, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars, was that I couldn't get past was the smell. I guess it's the material or something, I'm not sure. It smells so strange though and it is NOT pleasant. It make it difficult to wear for any length of time. I thought at first that maybe it was me, but I saw someone else said that in their review as well, so I guess it was not my imagination. I'm going to try washing it in some strong fabric softener and see if that helps at all. Otherwise, the mask itself is practical and beautiful."
4.0,"Could have came in something better than a plastic, sealed bag. I didn't like that they were scattered in a bag. But the product was pretty good for the price"
4.0,"This top really looks more expensive than it is. It's much cooler than expected for my tropical climate and is an easy, casual look. I ordered it in 4 colours - all were great except the red - closer to burgundy which I don't like.<br />Order your regular US size"
4.0,Cute dress but you have to to be very thin to where it.
4.0,I got these for my child they fit them fine but too small for an adult man.
4.0,Was expecting t-shirt like material
4.0,"The shorts fit great and the material is fantastic. The shirt is probably sized right for those with a smaller chest. At this price, I'm perfectly happy only wearing the shorts"
4.0,"Very cute - read the size description, though! This is a purse and not a tote."
4.0,Fits as expected and very durable. Will buy again
4.0,My grandsun loves it. The bag was much bigger than expected and it looks really nice. It‚Äôs a well made bag. The extras are a great bonus.
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but it is made well."
4.0,Prefect. Bought 2 pairs.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 124lbs. I got a medium and it fits perfectly. It‚Äôs a nice dress for summer date. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is it has that weird shape on my body. But will still wear it.:)
4.0,"Its what you pay for, a cheap naruto costume lol. The shorts were a little short and the shirt sleeves a little long, but overall not bad. Very clearly costume material, I got a size small at 5'6 and it fit well."
4.0,"Nice shirt, fits good, like the logo, good Champion quality, super short sleeves."
4.0,"The suit cases arrived today and they are nice, but I can't really say the are hard sided, they are more flexible then hard sided. I will use them on my trip and see how they hold up."
4.0,"Pretty, a little bit shiny compared to the other charms on my bracelet, but it looks good!"
4.0,"This is a nice cross, especially for the price. It looks to be sturdy. I personally feel someone younger would appreciate it more. The chain is long. You can tuck the cross under your shirt. Overall, a good buy."
4.0,"I'm 5'2, 165lbs and I ordered a large. It fits great up top, but its wide at the bottom and gives no shape, but that's what I was looking for so I love it. Its great with leggings, boots and a cute hat."
4.0,Just what I expected.  Fits perfectly would recommend
4.0,"Other than the fact it‚Äôs a little too small, I like it."
4.0,the pendant wasn`t quite as big as i thought it was going to be.. but it`s still as awesome as it looks in the picture. sometimes less is more anyways.
4.0,"This dress would have been perfect if it came in a smaller size. Note I would not recommend the polka-dot dress. It looks like Minnie Mouse. But if the cut was right then I would definitely buy it. The manufacturer just needs to make this in an extra small. For a reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and I weigh 128lbs and my measurements are 34, 28, 36. I have a muscular build with a slight tummy."
4.0,I love it. Its odd and my husband adores it.
4.0,"There is an elastic band right under the bust that Is way smaller than the rest of the dress.. size up, also the sleeves are tight, and very short. Looks like your armpit is hungry. Not a good look."
4.0,"This reveals your face, your smile, allows for wearing glasses, and for people who read lips to understand you.<br />It is breathable.<br />It us designed to fit men, who have larger faces and jaws, so it's a bit cumbersome for a woman."
4.0,Love the feel..comes bigger than usual size...love the design !!!!
4.0,"For the price, these can't be beat. They look cute and fit fairly well, after a bit of bending and adjusting. They do not feel high-quality, so if you're looking for something long-lasting and expensive-looking, these aren't them. Not bad, if you're like me and can't buy expensive glasses because you always lose or scratch them."
4.0,"The Pants is very current in style, fits alright but too long  you need to cut an inch and hem it if you are a short girl.<br />some fit one size pants sold by other sellers is not this long. . color is so cool for summer days like this in  the south."
4.0,"I really like this sexy nightgown. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 155 lbs with a 36b bust and this fits me perfectly. It skims the top of my feet and is a great length for those who are a little taller. The mesh fabric is nicer than I expected . I don‚Äôt think the lace bit in the middle really adds anything to the gown, but it‚Äôs fine. The shape of this gown is really slimming as it nips in under the bust and skims over the lower body. The top part gives fairly decent support for average bust sizes. The thong that came with mine was borderline too small for me, but that‚Äôs fine. I just wear with with other panties. I washed mine on a delicate wash cycle and put it in the dryer on gentle with a dryer sheet for static, and it came out just fine. I slept in this and it was comfortable for that purpose as well. Husband liked it a lot also. If there were more colors, I might order more. Recommended."
4.0,"Perfect as a cover up for a winter party. The fur sheds quite a bit, though."
4.0,"Really loved the product. I'm from Brazil and my aunt brought it to me, and it was a huge hit. The reason I won't rate it 5 stars is because it came with a small tear and leaked filling. I'll fix it manually, it would be really troublesome to send it back from Brazil. Anyway, liked a lot, would buy again and hope these small problem don't happen to other costumers."
4.0,This dress would have been a perfect 10 if it was longer. Why are y'all dresses so short. I like classy simple church dresses that come to my knees. Every dress I order from you all are nice fit but extremely short!!
4.0,"Fits well, runs a bit big. Shirt is somewhat boxy. Nice stretch and reasonable quality at $13."
4.0,I bought this in a size 32C which is the same size I wear in a bra. A little too tight on the bottom also I thought there was pouting when I ordered it but besides that there is good support.
4.0,Runs small but it is Beautiful!!
4.0,Thin material but still loved this dress.
4.0,"If this suit is a perfect match for your body style, it is an excellent choice. As always, black offers a certain slimming effect and the halter cut makes the shoulder and bust area look gorgeous. The tummy control panel is helpful and the details around the tummy area (below the waist) add additional contouring. I‚Äôm not sure that the little bow isn‚Äôt redundant, it‚Äôs not really necessary and it just hangs there like a wet rag. I think it looks better overall if you cut the bow off, but that‚Äôs my taste. That little key hole in the neckline is a nice touch.<br /><br />‚ÄúMedium‚Äù is a size that covers a lot of territory. It can fit a very thin person with a long torso (in which all the stretch goes lengthwise) or a person with a regular length torso with wider hips or buttocks (in which case the all the stretch goes sideways and it pulls a little lengthwise). The halter straps are somewhat adjustable, but the clip at the neck is not. It only has one position, so the length measurement is not adjustable (which would have been nice.) I think that the slim person with a long torso is this suit‚Äôs ideal customer. Slim but with wide hips is not this suits ideal, especially since the suit‚Äôs cut rides high on the hips.<br /><br />The bathing suit feels nice and is an even and attractive shade of black. My only concern is that the laundering instructions say not to use chlorine. This is a bit perplexing as almost all swimming pools have chlorine in the water. My daughter used it in her pool and rinsed it off after use, laundered it as usual (w/o chlorine of course) and found that there was no color fading and the pool chlorine apparently caused no damage to the color‚Äîwhether in the long term it will cause problems for the spandex, we don‚Äôt know yet."
4.0,Fits true to size however the stitching around the band and pleats sewn bad stitching but for the price OK. The material is very good grade!
4.0,The chords are not beads but rather string.  It is still very nice.
4.0,Muy peque√±a para mi. Yo compre talla M y me quedo peque√±a en Las piernaa.
4.0,Cute shirt. It is a little shorter then I would like but I still wear it and like it!
4.0,Sunglasses are a good fit. Work well. I was disappointed that they didn't come with a protective bag or cleaning cloth.
4.0,Very puffy warm & would purchase again.
4.0,"These are really cute glasses. I wish they had UV protection, though. That's my only complaint. They were well packed and the shipping was fast. I am wearing them more as a fashion statement than for protection from the sun. Without UV protection they are not really for the sun."
4.0,"I recently broke the watchband for my Timex that I have had for years. I wanted a plain, tough, practically working watchband for my watch, so I bought this product. The nylon is of superior quality, though fraying is a minor issue after worn extensively. The hardware is VERY well made and slick looking. When you get this, I would recommend putting it in cold water then drying it, so that way it won't shrink after you put it on your wrist and start getting it worn in. The fraying is most prevelant along the holes running down the center of the band. I recommend taking a lighter, after you've gotten it wet and dried it, and quickly run the flame along the edges of the watchband and down the holes in the center of the band. This should prevent bad fraying. I would definitely buy this product again, without second thought. Worth the price."
4.0,"Other than the size running small, I have no complaints. Material is good."
4.0,I really liked this dress. It fits nicely and is extremely comfy. You do have to be careful putting in on and taking it off as the material is delicate and it can tear at the seams easily. This is he reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It sits under the breast and hangs nicely. I paired it with leggings.
4.0,"I love most Allegra tops. This top was very pretty but VERY big! I am usually a size large. I have a large chest, 5'4,and 160lbs. The shirt was almost at my knees and loose. It's the type of long shirt that could be made into a dress but would look sloppy ( even with a cute belt). I am going to order a medium and hope for the best."
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, but as previous reviewers have commented, it‚Äôs a very ‚Äúhard‚Äù leather. It really does feel partly plastic."
4.0,Beautiful set. Looks better then the real set I wanted to buy. Only issue is that one of the earring posts is so fragile I am afraid it will break any minute and why I only gave 4 stars
4.0,"Finding a good mask for school is not easy for a 10 year old girl. These masks are perfect. The size is adjustable, breathes easily, filters are replaceable. Washable and dry without problems. Recommend."
4.0,I bought this in honor of my partner who is named Faris. It's very pretty but doesn't look that much like a Ferris wheel. I still love it and wear it happily and it's a unique design.
4.0,"Well made suit, the front print is flattering but the back print is not the same as the front print. Much wider stripes so not the prettiest on the backside. Fit/sizing is good. If you are on the cusp of a size, always go next size up."
4.0,Thought it would be more navy. It is an almost black navy.
4.0,"The item I received is not the very delicate pink pictured here. Mine is more a soft, dusty mauve. It is pretty and made of nice fabric, so I will certainly wear it, but I wish it were the rose petal pink advertised here on Amazon."
4.0,Material is cheap and grips don't really grip.
4.0,"The socks themselves are nice, but the binding is still cutting in at the ankles and mine aren't even that big."
4.0,Fit perfectly and super cute.
4.0,Color is little bit different otherwise it's good.
4.0,"I love the costume, but it did not come with the tights - picture is very deceiving!!!"
4.0,The robes are what I expected. I bought three and everyone loved them.
4.0,I love these slippers. They a super cute. The colors are rich deep and rich. They are exactly as pictured. Only problem is they were larger than labeled. I wear a women‚Äôs 61/2. They recommend a medium. Although the are a bit big I can still wear them . And I love them!
4.0,This dress was pretty cheaply made. And if you‚Äôre tall (5‚Äô9) and want your maxi dresses to somewhat touch the floor then dont purchase .
4.0,Really comfortable! I wish The sleeves were a little tighter around the wrist but other than that Love it!
4.0,"New band works two days in. However, it is replacing another Teak brand band that failed after about six months."
4.0,"These are good-looking enough to have garnered compliments from my teenagers : ) and are very helpful for general wear outdoors on not-too-sunny days and indoors on migraine days. For summer I'll need a darker or polarized set, and the arms are a little loose after several wears but I expect they'll last fairly well."
4.0,The black and gray design is very flattering and the legs are snug to curtail the legs rolling up. I am size 12/14 the large fit well and mid thigh. Very comfortable
4.0,"This works. Husband has really thin skin, and with dogs jumping up on him, they would cause injury.  Just slip these on, and there's no problem."
4.0,this is wonderful. It lays flat against your body. The strap is wide. It has several pockets inside and out. The only down fall is I have the fit as small as it will go and it still slips right off of my hips. I like it enough that I will take it to a local place to have the strap made smaller.
4.0,"The socks fit great except a little too tight around the top band.  Love the colors. Have only worn them once so far, but they seem ok."
4.0,It was great. My friend like it very much
4.0,"I bought the gloves to complete the costume my 5 year old son wanted and he loves them.  The gloves are a little big for him, but makes it more fun for playing Spiderman!"
4.0,The hat is adorable and I really like that it is reversible. It is a little large for her 6month head but she will grow into it.
4.0,Very cute but very tight and runs very small my 8 year old had trouble times getting them on
4.0,"Comfortable, nice length. Only complaint? Where the skirt meets the top portion, the lines are very visibly crooked... Attention to detail is important!"
4.0,"Good quality, but looks too small"
4.0,"It was alright. Kind of cheaply made, like you could feel it. But I like the design."
4.0,"Nice dress a bit longer than I expected. The material is nice I like the pockets it has. Fits nice and snug around my chest. I am 5'4"" weigh 155lbs and am 36B cup."
4.0,"Fits larger than expected, it is cute but there are no buttons to close it if you want. It is nice, but larger for sure."
4.0,"I'm 5'11 so it is very hard for me to find rompers that fit. This romper fit in the length, the material is very soft and not see through. My only negative is the pockets are in a odd spot and they add just a little bulk to your mid section but not enough that I wouldn't wear it."
4.0,"Very cute rings. A little rub off on the smallest ring that made my finger slightly brown, but washed right off."
4.0,They are nice but larger than expected.  wish they were a half size smaller.
4.0,"This dress was cute and flattering, but I ordered it specifically hoping it would be something I could easily nurse my baby while wearing. I was very disappointed when I received the dress and discovered that the buttons are purely aesthetic and just sewn on the front. I returned it."
4.0,Fit great my son loves the pattern
4.0,I love  these socks because I can wear these with flip flops if I needed to.<br />I also love the nonskid bottoms. I almost fell on floors wearing reg socks ( slippery floors) and strained my back.<br />Didn't like that feeling at all. Better safe than sorry!
4.0,The elastic on the ankle is a little tight for me.
4.0,"Wore the shirt on a recent 4 week trip to S. Africa on a photo safari.  It kept me warm on cool mornings & was great at sun protection in the warm afternoons without being too hot.  I liked the easy wash ability of the shirt, it didn't wrinkle, & was fashionable. Not crazy about the green color, but there was limited availability when I ordered it.  Hope to try it out snorkeling sometime in the future. All in all, a good shirt."
4.0,Very cute and it fit my neck however the clasp was fused shut and the chain was way too long. I had to shorten the chain. I was eventually able to break open the clasp.
4.0,This dress is so comfortable and flattering- feels like a princess
4.0,Yes so soft and warm....will buy again in Winter
4.0,I love the material and the fit. I order tall but it comes about to ankles. I'm 5'10&#34; tall and it could have been a little longer but it still is comfy.
4.0,The one bad thing about this shirt is the sizing.  Size up and it'll be great.
4.0,Big glasses.... little short behind the ears... I like them
4.0,I like the feel but really hard to get on and off
4.0,Not bad at all. The leather is matte colored and not glossy which I think would make it appear very cheap looking. Doesn't feel flimsy or thin. Price is reasonable. The watch I am using it on is a Fossil Q Explorist.
4.0,"It is a really lovely fascinator but the wrong colour for my outfit so had to return it ... it‚Äôs more of a peach colour than pale champagne. It arrived in a beautiful gift box. Shame, as it is really nice!"
4.0,Very comfortable. Strecthes while you wear them though. But love them!
4.0,"Excellent styling, sturdy fabric, but the zipper top is too close to the waist seam."
4.0,Bought for my son when he fell in love with the Beatles. He loves this shirt.
4.0,Holds together amazingly I love this I use it as a purse
4.0,"Definitely too big for my 2yo, but will be great as he gets older."
4.0,"This is a great quality product, especially for the price. However, they were too small for me as I have a wider head."
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings and I do like them, but the pearl is so heavy that it pulls the chain back through the ear. I'll still wear them, but I will have to use backs, which irritate my ears."
4.0,Really nice.. feels good .. could use a little support to  the front neck but it works
4.0,I like it nice and flattering. Only complaint is that it kind of is see through
4.0,These are tights are nice and soft and  fit my 9 year old granddaughter as expected.  They were washed in cold water before wearing and hung up to dry.  So far so good.
4.0,"Only reason I'm not giving it five stars, is the fabric feels a little odd to me. Slightly cheap and clingy, other than that it's really cute and comfortable."
4.0,Bought them as a Christmas gift.  They loved them.  They were nicer than I expected for the price its a great deal
4.0,"Not what I expected. Wanted the pendant to be transparent, not backed with a black back."
4.0,"I was looking for a band replacement for my Burberry watch whixh came with a white leather band. Came across this one, was skeptical if it l fit or not. The band reached on time and did fit well. Since it comes with the necesaary tools was very easy to replace! Ordered 16mm for this watch."
4.0,These sunglasses are so cute and fit my son perfectly (he's 6) but they have a small crack in the frame. Will unfortunately have to return but I will be reordering!
4.0,"Good quality, feels more like a tent, not shape forming. After a few alterations it will be perfect for our Christmas party"
4.0,"These are super stretchy and will last for a lot of growth.  The mustard yellow ones have sort of a two toned vibe going on - like mustard and citron.  It's odd, but not super noticeable when looking down at your toddler from above.  :D"
4.0,Glad I found this game.
4.0,Fits nice not too tight not too loose I got XS I‚Äôm 156 pounds 5‚Äô5 and fits nicely
4.0,"This is a cute swimsuit. The top seems a little tight, skirt fits as expected. The skirt though does not match the color of the top. Disappointed but will keep it."
4.0,"I have been on a Road Glide at 60 mph and temperatures of 48 degrees. My hands did not get cold. The grip is a little loose on the throttle. I can‚Äôt say theses gloves feel hot but my hands stayed warm. My hands get cold and painful easily. Three settings, high lasted two hours, about as long as I can ride in that temperature."
4.0,"Just as others said, this shirt was a bit on the wide side. I gave this to my sister and she just tucks one side of the shirt into her hip and it looks fabulous. She loves the fabric too! It came just as pictured."
4.0,I just received this cute little necklace. I ordered the small. It is exactly as described. The only thing is that I wish it was longer. It's a choker on me but with an extender I'm sure it will be just perfect!
4.0,Bonito pero quedo algo grande
4.0,"It wasn‚Äôt exactly the shirt that I ordered because the one I got was the black shirt design but in white, HOWEVER I still like it and I‚Äôm planning on wearing it to the BTS concert in Chicago. The shirt is pretty true to size seeing as how I got a medium and it fit me like normal women‚Äôs medium. The material is super comfortable too!"
4.0,"perfect fit even after a couple of washes,"
4.0,Really big but sooo cute. I'd recommend getting a size or 2 smaller than you would normally get.
4.0,"Cute, small beret. Nice wool. I'm pleased."
4.0,"I was impressed with the dress and the quality of fabric. I had to return it due to it being too small, but that was because I just had a baby and wasn‚Äôt sure what size would fit best. I like the empire waist in front but the back seam is lower near your natural waste. Very flattering. And the tall length was actually long enough to fit my 6 ft frame!"
4.0,"This is cute but the sunglasses are for an adult and this was intended for a child. We're excited to use it, sturdy enough to withstand a toddler's abuse"
4.0,"Ordered the white with green leaves.  Super comfy!  I have a feeling it'll be a bit see through outdoors, so could end up being a cover up...ordered large and it fits perfectly. (36DD, 170 lbs, 5'7"")"
4.0,"I love it.  Fit as expected.  It is long. I am 5'7&#34;. Hangs below the knee at the longest points. Beware the colors aren't true colors.  I ordered hunter green and it is more of a heather green.  I like the color but I ordered it to go with something truly hunter green.  Looks great with a beige, rose, or even a semi-purplish  t-shirt and jeans.  It is not a heavy sweater but it is not wispy thin either.  Good purchase."
4.0,"LOVE the top! I'm 5'4, 140, and 36C. I ordered a large and the top is SO flattering. I struggle with falling out of bathing suits in the middle or underneath but the adjustable straps and the wrap style make it easy to secure everything. I feel so confident wearing this top and it's still adorable as ever. The bottoms were a little small but they're manageable. Definitely size up when you order. I usually wear a small to medium bottom so I'm glad I went with the large. The quality is great and I think it will last me many trips to the beach. Also, the print is super cute on the bottoms! Overall I would definitely recommend this to a friend!"
4.0,I've had this jacket for two years and have worn this in 110 to 20 deg F weather and it has been great to me.  I've got some issues with the design and the weight of the jacket.  I had the Rally jacket and survived a 50 mph head on crash and walked away so I have a lot of faith in the protection.  it is my primary jacket and I like the gortex feature and the protection...lots of pockets and other funny features
4.0,I really like the wallet. Only drawback is there is a strong plastic or chemical odor that still hasn't gone away all the way.
4.0,"Only con is they could be a little more flexible at the thumb.  Overall, great for the price"
4.0,"Super cute, lots of room. Plenty of space for my Moto G5+. Will probably decorate as it's rather plain, but it does the job I wanted! Would be super cute with a strap added."
4.0,Fits nicely and is pretty flattering
4.0,The green one is very cute.  Not a quality product but should survive a few delicate washings.  I feel it is definitely going to work for a holiday party that is casual.
4.0,Bought this for my Mom as a Christmas gift (she collects frogs).  She loved it - put it on as soon as she opened the gift. I took one star away simply because it's not packaged very nicely. I comes in a plastic bag. I went and bought a jewelry box to wrap it in.
4.0,THe blouse is pretty but the collar is a little different.  I just tuck it in on the sides and it looks great.
4.0,"They are very pretty and feminine, aside from the main function of protecting your hands from the sun! The only problem was that I did wait a long time to receive them."
4.0,As long as you follow their size chart! I usually take a Medium-large. These were marked differently. I had to order s 2 X
4.0,It is lovely.<br /><br />Small band.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and flows. It www perfect for my girls trip to a winery. The material was not as breathable as I would like. Def not made of cotton. But overall it‚Äôs a nice little dress.
4.0,"The apron and hat arrived in good condition. They seem like they'll be a little big on my 4 year old, which is good so that he can get years of use out of them. I'm saving them for a gift; he'll be so excited."
4.0,This is a very delicate & dainty bracelet that looks very feminine
4.0,"The wrist band is breathable and machine washable, huge benefit being an LNA. Only downside is it's a little big for my small wrist when adjusted to the smallest size. Love the bright colors!"
4.0,Just like the pic but it shrinks when washed. Buy it larger than needed.
4.0,"Works great when you don't have much to carry around. If you overstuff it though, this zipper doesn't exactly stay shut. I've been able to fit my phone in it, with some cards and cash. I've tried packing in a tube of chopstick and that's where the problems start. But other than that, it's a great, convenient wristlet!"
4.0,"This was great! Fit was as expected and my daughter loves it. But then it seems to wear out really easy in the toes in the pool. We use it about 3 days a week on average in the pool. Also took it to the lake and to the ocean. Seems to wear out at the toes the most for the pool. When it came apart, I just sewed the toes back on and it was fine. But just a thought."
4.0,Very attractive. Not too large but it still makes a statement. This seems to run a little larger than my actual ring size. Overall a very nice looking Lucky Horse-shoe Ring.
4.0,"I bought one of almost every color of these foe my friends and I. They all look great but they're really big. If you have small wrists,  it kinda just hangs on your wrists. Would look better if it was a bit more fit."
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter's prom.  It is beautiful and well made.  However, the only way to put this dress on is through the narrow neck area which barely fit my daughter's head.  If she has her hair done in an updo, it would mess it up putting the dress.  Also, while the rest of the dress fits beautifully (would have had to had it hemmed several inches) it was strangely small in the back.  There was not enough strap material to snap it.  This dress would only fit someone that has very narrow shoulders and back."
4.0,"Gorgeous material and long train. Very intricate design but‚Ä¶..<br /><br />The fit is huge. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù, weigh 160, and my measurements are bust 36, waist 31, hips 42. I<br />Ordered this in a size 14 since it was the only size with prime and it should have fit just a tad loose based off of size chart. I measured the waist of the dress I received and it is actually 35 inches instead of 32. It was huge on me so I had to send it back.<br /><br />I am holding the excess material behind my back in the photos to keep it on me and somewhat form fitted. I wish they had this in smaller sizes fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />The only other thing I was disappointed with is the coloring. I thought that just the outer layer material would be white, but the base layer would be more of a nude color like the picture. The all white under and over does not give the intricate design justice.<br /><br />The last thing I am going to say is that this dress has 5 layers of skirts and even a thick mesh petticoat. The dress is puffy and not sleek on the bottom like in the pictures. It would be simple to cut out the extra layers of skirts though to achieve the sleeker slimmer look."
4.0,"This is more like junior size, I will suggest order one size up as your usual size. I am happy I did."
4.0,I loved these and can't seem to get them anywhere anymore.
4.0,"If you like draw string tops, you will probably like this one. It is a soft material and true to size. I got #1 blue in an XL. I feel the color was true to the picture. My measurements are 48-36-48 I typically wear xl-2x. This fit perfectly in my opinion. The stitching is not amazing but I didn't expect it to be. It's great dressy casual top."
4.0,Dad loved this product!! He felt special
4.0,Dress es were beautiful. One thing though is that after laundrying and using fabric softener it still  did not get soft.
4.0,"Nice necklaces, perfect length for me, but had to return one of the 4 that I purchased unfortunately it broke at the clasp.  The other necklaces seem to be okay, wore one yesterday without any problem.  Return was easy and quick.  Will order again from this company."
4.0,"Cute dress. Size wasn't right. I ordered the same dress, same size, different pattern, and that one fit well but this one is too big and looks like I'm swimming in it. Soft material though, cute dress. Just not the right size"
4.0,The company delivered a new watch at no charge and I am happy to report that it is the right watch that I wanted and it is keeping time.
4.0,bright colors and well made
4.0,Runs way big and is pretty long (mid calf and I'm 5'10&#34;).  A bit shinier than expected but still nice.  Very gathered at the sides which probably works well for some girls but for me it just feels like it was adding bulk rather than being forgiving of lines.  I ended up giving it to my sister who said she can wear it to work.
4.0,Softest leggings I own! These run generous but I love that. I own my size then a size down. I wear my size around the house to lounge in and the size down outside the house. They are more like a fleecy type material so they are great for wearing on a cold day but thin and do not feel heavy. They do fill easily if you use the dryer so I air dry my smaller size ones. Honestly they are so comfortable once they get very pilled I put those in my drawer for only sleeping and just buy a new pair they are that good!
4.0,Really great wearing tanks and most comfortable.  I would definitely purchase again.
4.0,üòø
4.0,This fit exactly as would be expected according to the sizing chart. I was ordering based off of review suggestion and got a MEDIUM. I would normally get a SMALL for this type of wear and a SMALL was what I was really wanting. A MEDIUM is snug but I would rather have a smaller snugger more restricting fit. I am a colostomy patient and these shirts are great for intimacy time with your partner so you can hide the unsightly bag. to be honest that is the only reason I got them. Do wash them separately by color for first time if not alone. I have some nice pink underwear that was tossed in with the red shirt on their first wash. Then again what red clothing does not do this on their first wash! ;)
4.0,"I love my Blunnies and I've got a number of pairs. But for the first time I'm disappointed in that there is no repair if the heel wears and comes apart. Except for the heel, the shoes are still perfect . I cannot wear the boots because they will be uneven and that causes leg and back problems! I contacted Blundstone USA and they said the heel cannot be repairs!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but a bit form fitting"
4.0,"It got here pretty quickly. The chain it came with was too long, though."
4.0,these are like $7 a piece...they are comfortable and soft.  whats not to like?
4.0,"Came looking just like they do on here, really nice detail on the sides as well. If you have narrow feet like me these boots are great. My only complaint is that the top can't really be pulled as tight as I would've liked (I usually wear combat boots) and it took awhile to break them in. All in all, I recommend them."
4.0,"Nice dress..Just not overly excited about it..<br />The quality isn't the best, you get what you pay for, but it seems more simple rather than picture.."
4.0,Happy to have received this as a birthday present!  It holds multiple credit and business cards and gets the job done.  It is starting to show some wear around the edges but I also have it bursting at the seams with cards.  This is the best vegan wallet I've seen that actually looks like a professional wallet.
4.0,Was longer than expected. color is very washed out. It's ok.
4.0,Beautiful dress was too big for me. I gave it to a friend she absolutely loves it
4.0,Colors were a little off bit love it
4.0,I'm 5'3 150lbs with about a 2 inch heel it doesn't drag floor. :)
4.0,Will be nice for a trip to Mexico. Will let you know if the color does weird things in the wash or with chlorine water.
4.0,Got several compliments while carrying the bag. Used it on vacation to carry my purse contents and water and any purchases. Super handy an easy to use.
4.0,I loved the necklace but was really tight around the neck . Had to get a extender
4.0,It was more of a T-shirt. So a lot of extra and long fabric at bottom.  But overall good for price.
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute got here in a week. The only negative part is it fits a little big.
4.0,Warm tshirt
4.0,"Great lines, cute pattern, fits well. The material is kind of thin and shiny, definitely not cotton. Great for warmer climates. I have worn it a few times and I always get compliments on it."
4.0,only thing I don't like is that it picks up every piece of fuzz or lint then it looks warn.
4.0,"Love the style, color and fabric of this blue wrap.<br /><br />4 stars because it still fits smaller than it should for a shapely but thin size 8-10 woman. I'd say it's made for size 8 and smaller...anything bigger and you're going be readjusting it often."
4.0,"Fit as expected. Wish the black and gray was the same price though! I got the gray because I'm penny pinching for my wedding but would have preferred the black. Anywho, it fits well and it's still cute! Looking forward to wearing it to the airport on our honeymoon :)"
4.0,"The boots came perfect. No damage here. But, the picture makes it look like the boots will fit to your leg, which they do not. They sag a little, and the inside was a tad bog, but overall a great product and very fashionable!"
4.0,Product is ok.
4.0,"These are great no frills luggage tags.  I bought them for the upcoming school year as we tag my sons backpack, lunch bag, etc.  the only thing I didn't like about these is that there is no plastic film over the tag.  Rain and wetness will over time decrease the durability.  I just put a film of clear plastic tape over the tag and we're set.  I highly recommend this 10 pack because the price is reasonable, the red is a nice bright red color (easy to spot), and it is made of thick plastic.<br /><br />This product was given to me at a promotional price or free for my honest review.  All opinions are mine.  I am not required to give a positive review.  I am not affiliated with this company.  I pride myself in giving clear and concise information that I would want to know as a consumer. I hope my review helps."
4.0,"Very small, gave to my daughter and she loves it."
4.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; 150# and fairly slim. I got the US medium (asian XL) and it fits me perfectly in the arms, shoulders and overall length from collar to bottom hem. The only area where fit isn't ideal is in the stomach/waist area. It's not that the fit is too tight or too loose, the feel is good. It's that when looking in the mirror that area just seems a bit baggier than the rest of the jacket. It's like the rest of the jacket was going for the slim look but the stomach/waist area was going for a more traditional look. Going around day to day it would probably wouldn't be noticeable, but when looking straight on in a mirror it shows. If I use my hand to cinch the back of the jacket some, it will get the more fitted profile I want. Hopefully a tailor will be able to do this for me since it's not worth returning for a smaller size as every other part of the jacket fits right.<br /><br />The overall build quality of the jacket is great for the price. Seems solidly made and looks stylish. It is a perfect fall jacket that will keep you fairly warm and can accommodate some layers underneath. Just be mindful if you're looking for a true slim fit, the midsection may require some tailoring or maybe trying a smaller size than otherwise recommended (though I don't know if this would make arms and shoulders too short). I am overall happy with my purchase and might consider getting another color/style in the future."
4.0,This product was very good.
4.0,"The smell takes forever to go away. Also a little big in the foot (bought and 8.5, fits like a 9)  and the leg length ( I am of average height and leg length)"
4.0,"Just got this today. The overall feel of the metal is great. It has a good weight to it. The fit could be a bit better for the Blaze itself, but it works. Plus it looks awesome! Pairs great with the black leather loop band."
4.0,Very pleased with my scarf! It‚Äôs very warm and thick enough these cold weather. Glad scarf for the price and quality.
4.0,"It is a little long and the fabric could have been softer, but overall I love the dress."
4.0,"product fits well, stays where it belongs, very comfortable."
4.0,I bought  this brand from a local boutique and loved them especially the jean look. I ordered because they no longer sold. I love them except that I ordered a denim and a black. I got denim and grey. The grey looks kinda like for an older person. I guess i will wear them some but much rather have had my black. Please folks pay attention when filling an order.
4.0,"Great Bag.  The only issue is the elastic compartments are too tight.  I am unable to fit my helmet and shoes in the compartment with out feeling like it may rip, but so far it has not.  The other compartments are great.  There is plenty of room for all my bike gear....helmet, shoes, pump, spare tubes, cliff bars, change of clothes, water bottles, and a towel, and there is still plenty of room.  For anyone looking at a bag to put there bike gear in this is a good choice.  I keep mine ready to go at all times.  Would have given it five stars, but I have only owned it for a couple of months.....if it makes it a year in good shape I will change it to five stars."
4.0,Product was pretty good over all but confirm fit not really
4.0,"The pictures are a but deceiving with the color. Instead of off white/cream like it appears, it's actually a light/med tone gret color. Although that's off, the quality is spot on. I love the pockets and the space provided in the bag itself.<br />Another thing worth mentioning is the length of the straps. I'm pretty small, but I couldn't comfortably wear this on my shoulder. The space between the straps doesn't provide enough room and I didnt even try it when it was full.<br />All in all, the quality is there. It's a nice, quality bag."
4.0,The quality seems fine so far. Looks just like the picture. Not much else to say.
4.0,"Very Nice, but too small for me.<br />Thanks!"
4.0,I was more than surprised 9ver the packaging and the quality of these bras. I thought they were pricey but turned out to be worth the money for the quality. I will be purchasing more fir other granddaughters for sure
4.0,I loved my bracelets. I would order 12 more but don't want a repeat of bracelets. Could that happen.
4.0,Wifey love it
4.0,Ordered my normal size and it was about 2 sizes too small. Otherwise it seemed nice.
4.0,"The dress looks pretty on the picture and of good quality. Unfortunately, it's very shapeless and it's huge. It looks like an umbrella with holes for the head and arms. Too bad......the picture online is very deceiving."
4.0,very nice and my wife she it ao much
4.0,Pure cotton not at dressy material.
4.0,"My 3 year old twin nieces really like these.  I like them too.  Wash easy, comfortable to wear.  The white netting underneath is a little less &#34;cute&#34; than I had expected.. and it tends to have a lot of hanging threads.  I am giving a 4 instead of a 3 because the girls like them so much."
4.0,Love the look. Hides the belly.
4.0,The back covers doesn‚Äôt let it charge
4.0,"These socks are a good quality, terrific grippers, vibrant colors (have not washed yet, so I'm hoping it's colorfast.  The size is good , but I feel run short.  My grandson has shorter feet for is height, and the socks just make it.  But all-in-all he says they're comfortable and loves them."
4.0,I call this a long shirt but I can see how others could call this a dress. I really love the look of it!! It's just a little snug so I'm going to exchange it for an xl. I'm 5'3&#34; and 160 lbs. I just had a baby so I do have a flabby belly. I like the length and the look just need the right size :-)
4.0,Love this sweater. It is super soft and is casual without looking like you stopped trying :). The only downside is that it snags easily.
4.0,Its largwr than what i expected it to be but its still very nice!
4.0,"These have a lot of room in the toe box and are a bit large - initially thought I would return them but decided to keep as a spare &#34;outdoor&#34; shoe, handy for running out quickly to fill the bird-feeders, etc. Would not use these for planting, as the low profile will let the dirt, etc. inside but they are otherwise good for yardword, very comfortable and easy to clean"
4.0,Very cute.  I have a long torso and the waist didn‚Äôt sit properly.
4.0,"I ordered a 3T and my son is still wearing 2t in some items.  So I figured he would have plenty of time to grow into this.  I almost sent it back but he was so excited to get it in the mail and wear it I didnt want to break his heart returning it.  Anyway, it's very soft and has inside ties and the quality seems pretty good.  I would definitely go up a few sizes."
4.0,"Really cute body suit, just like pictured.I ordered the medium, it was a bit tight, the leg holes were too small and the seams around the holes had no stretch. The fabric is thin with a little stretch to it. I sent it back and will order a large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 138lbs, 36C."
4.0,Very cute belt for the price :)  I wear a size 6/8  or Medium and find it to fit nicely.  Color is true to my monitor.
4.0,"The jewel is so small. It took me a while to screw it on. It‚Äôs cute though, just tiny!"
4.0,This necklace is absolutely beautiful and I am very pleased.  I may have to order another as it was a gift order and now I have to keep it!!
4.0,"Great glasses. So far, so good.  The fit is comfortable and no slip. I wore these during a recent 22 mile trail run and only encountered some mild fogging, that was easily fixed by removing glasses for a moment. Also great for driving thanks to the polarized lenses."
4.0,"Order one size larger, otherwise amazing shorts."
4.0,Really cute.  Decent quality.  Runs smaller than expected - so the normal sports bra wrestle was amped up because of fit and the strappiness.  Gave to my sister and she is happy with it.
4.0,"It is really cute overall. The top is really big on my waist area, wish was a little more fitted and the pants were a tad snug on waist and the crotch hangs really low. That all being said, I must admit I still like it, lol.... Honestly, it is perfect for what I need."
4.0,"True to size and very soft and comfortable. Piece between big toe very soft and comfortable. Not slippery, good grip on tile and hard wood. Rubbery plastic sole makes loud slapping noise on floor as I walk. Not ideal for walking on carpet."
4.0,"I brought it as a gift for my best friend. And she said she loved it, it had a lot of room and she could carry all the things she wanted to put in the bag and more. Her lasts words was it's beautiful thank you sis. For the wonderful bag I love it"
4.0,"First pair I received was shipped by amazon in an envelope - frame was bent and lens was partially popped out.  Seller offered replacement and I am very satisfied with the new pair, which shipped in a box.  Great fit, love the polarized lenses, and the style is super cute."
4.0,sizing was way off it was all good as we gifted these to a family member so all is ok with this product just beware that these run 2 sizes small<br /> thank you for the fast shipping and great prices
4.0,"I bought two and love the feel and the fit. Problem is I had to have it altered as they are way too long for my 5""2"" frame, so only four stars."
4.0,"I get compliments on this dress all the time. It is classy enough to wear to work with a blazer or for a night out. It's a beautiful dress, and looks like a very high quality item for a lot less money. Four stars because the belt is a bit cheaply made-- I can see it breaking down the line and me needing to find a replacement. The hole for the little nub to go through is already getting larger and wearing out."
4.0,These socks are very comfortable and thin. IT fits perfect for me and looks great with my athletic shoes. I love the different colors. looks very colorful.I washed these socks several times already still shaped well after several wash. Material is very good. It was worth the money.
4.0,I absolutely love this outfit. But it does not fit like pic. My child is very small for her age. I ordered get size and the pants are like Capri's and the shirt barely covers the breast. I would order it again if I order 3 sizes bigger and take up in the waste.
4.0,Shorter than it looks on the model by far. Not tunic length almost middrift. Still vvru cute but not as expected
4.0,"I use these for working out, they are great for that, since the cotton is a great absorbent. I have washed them a couple of times and they seem to hold up OK. There is some color running so make sure to wash separately. Overall pleased with my purchase"
4.0,Just fine for price.
4.0,"Nice belt for the price. The buckle feels sturdy and the holes are place well. Get a size up from your pants waist size, I'm not sure but I think the sizing is slightly off. I grew and cannot fit this belt anymore so I gave it to my younger cousin who loves it."
4.0,The top portion was not big enough
4.0,Works great. I'm used to wearing a D-ring on my keys but I thought this was a unique switch. Takes some time getting used to. I'm also used to feeling my keys on my hip but from time to time I have to check if they are still there because I don't feel them. Your keys easily clasp into place. Be wise of the thickness of your belt though. It is a tight fit on my leather belts.
4.0,it is pretty.  I got this for my daughter who was looking for something similar recently.<br />Pro: It is pretty and looks like it does in the picture.<br /><br />Con: It is easily tangled which is fairly annoying.  - took a while to get it sorted out to wear properly.  It is packaged in a small burlap bag which is odd.  Not suited for gift giving and helps tangle the piece further.
4.0,Great for cost but I recommend a half size smaller.
4.0,I can‚Äôt really say the mask is comfortable because it‚Äôs hard to talk with it on and it slips down occasionally. It‚Äôs a stylish mask but I don‚Äôt know that I feel it‚Äôs serving any purpose.
4.0,I keep looking for a 34D that has good support but where I don‚Äôt feel the underwire. Other than that this bra is beautiful.
4.0,"I was so excited to get this scarf to take family pictures. The colors though are not at all what is pictured. I thought it was red and black with some mustard yellow, but the scarf thatcame is definitely navy blue and red with neon yellow. The scarf was beautiful, just doesn‚Äôt work for our color scheme. Very large and warm."
4.0,These are adorable and good quality. But the 12-18 month size are huge on my 13 month old (whose feet seem big to me.) So I'm not sure when she'll be able to wear them but they are good shoes for the price.
4.0,"These are good quality bands, however they look thin on my hand. The originals are wider"
4.0,A little bigger than I expected but works for its purpose.
4.0,Outstanding color!
4.0,Roning to big
4.0,"I ordered a large because I had ordered two other suits and the medium was too small, but this one is true to size. It was big on me and I had to take it in on sides and make it tighter. Otherwise it is good. Look just like it does in the picture except that my body is not as tight as the model in the picture :("
4.0,"I really like the photo. The slim appearance and high collar cardigan would be a good outfit for the office.  In reality it was long and wide. The collar is situated lower than what's on the photo.<br /><br />I would say this cardigan is a coffee shop casual and comfortable wear. It's really soft and it keeps me warm. Aesthetically, this cardigan does not live up to the business casual appearance like that in the photo."
4.0,The product is just fine. I bought this as a gift for a frequent traveller who could also stash away the passport. The space available to store currency notes is not as much as what an average wallet would be able to carry without making the wallet bulge out awkwardly.
4.0,"I ordered the same size as the two shirts.In practice, however the two products are different in size."
4.0,"I love the lenght of the dress, the pockets and the wrap style bust.  The waist is a little higher than expected but still very cute!"
4.0,"Product came with a defect, but seller was fast to refund partial payment instead of returning them.  I plan to wear them for a night out in vegas....WISH ME LUCK! Will submit new review after..."
4.0,"I bought this travel backpack because I didn't want to travel overseas and around the US this summer with my book bag. Overall, I am pretty happy with the backpack, with a few caveats.<br /><br />Cons: The straps disconnect and stow away to create a briefcase-like bag which is great, except there is nowhere to stow the adjuster straps so they dangle and get in the way<br />-The second from the front pocket only has one zipper so you have to open it from the left side, two zippers would have been more convenient<br />-The plastic buckles for compressing the bag don't have anywhere to tuck in the excess strap, so they flop around a little bit<br /><br />Pros: Spacious, comfortable to wear or carry, and a good selection of pockets and sleeves<br />-Straps are comfortable and secure<br />-Zippers work smoothly<br />-You can fit a lot more than you think in this bag - it holds a lot of stuff<br />-Laptop sleeve is well designed and executed."
4.0,"quality was fine, they just fit smaller than expected"
4.0,I like the cuffs at the ankles.
4.0,Cool to the touch.
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This dress is so cute and flattering!  The A-line swing skirt starts at just the right point in the waist.  The stretchy material will accommodate many different body types.<br /><br />I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size medium or size 10 in dresses.  I got the size medium in this dress and it fits a bit snugly.  I would suggest considering sizing up if you want a more comfortable fit."
4.0,Keep in mind that you get what you pay for.I do like the bracelet but it probably wont last very long.
4.0,I bought 5xl. My size is xl. I bought bigger because every top i ever ordered through Amazon ran small. This top was actually too big! The sleeves are real long and the buttom is wide! I was gonna return it but i decided to keep it and were it. I love the shirt its just big but i'll make it work
4.0,"The underwires constantly came out, stabbing me but if you reenforce the ends it should be no problem."
4.0,I rate it a four the outfit does look like the picture but if your tall like me (5'9) the pants will be a little above the ankle (flooding) Still cute enough to show off!
4.0,"Very pretty, stones look blue in picture but the 1 I got was a bright purple which is perfect! Thanks to the company I got mine at a discount price.  Great item for any dolphin lover"
4.0,Really flattering and has amazing colors. Only nitpick is the sheerness but it IS white. I did t try to wear a white thong though and you could clearly see it so nude it was lol
4.0,I have not yet used to compression socks.  I will be traveling beginning next week and will wear them on the long flight and probably during my time away from home.  They appear to be well made and I hope they will provide the compression and support necessary.  Usually after a flight my feet and ankles are swollen for a few days and I would like to alleviate that problem.
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for my 8 year old daughter! It‚Äôs cute arrived quickly and I was mostly pleased. The only thing I can say is I wish the clasp on the chain could be a bit sturdier as it don‚Äôt stay clasped like it should and has fallen off a couple times.
4.0,"This is a cute casual dress for the price.  It fits a bit on the looser side for my 5'4"" and ""in shape"" frame.  But it flows down nicely and feels okay on the skin. The soft polyester breaths nicely in summer. Not see through, and stitching is good.  The airy dress feels nice as it allows a lot of air in. Shoulders are okay, decent and don't slip. Overall, for the price, it's a nice deal."
4.0,Warm and comfortable but seems to shift a lot while wearing
4.0,Decent quality: top is nice (i like the lining)/ bottoms are little awkward and smallish. I forgot to return it within 30 days...so will try to give it to someone as a gift.
4.0,"Not as fluffy as I had expected. I was planning to use for a tail for a Halloween costume, but I think it's too short."
4.0,skimpy
4.0,LOVED THiS DRESS‚ù£yOU CAN GO 1 SiZE UP.. iT's REALLy TRUE TO SiZE.iT FiTs GREAT üòä
4.0,Got it for my mother and she loves it. It fits her well and pulls her mid-section in right while properly hugging her curves.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I bought it for my mom. She loved the fit. It os true to size. She is normally a large. Large is what we ordered. The only downfall and maybe not for everyone,the back is too low cut for her taste."
4.0,"Ordered small, I‚Äôm 5ft 3 and 118lbs. Fit as excepted except the sleeves are short and I do not have long arms."
4.0,The watch looks really good and has kept time well. The band is a little thick and takes some time to break in.
4.0,Iike it . Simple style and easy to wear.
4.0,Really love this handbag.  Correct color and I am really enjoying the handbag again to use .
4.0,"I was disappointed in how fragile the chain is.  The charm is smaller than I thought it would be, too.  It was a gift and the person who received it has enjoyed wearing it although she did replace the chain with a sturdier one."
4.0,Bought this for a friend and it brought her to tears. Great quality and very cute little scarf attached. Just exactly what she wanted. White purse that can be used in any season and any outfit.
4.0,Fit is nice! Cut is nice! Didn‚Äôt like the fact that it‚Äôs aerated tho! But a good product at it‚Äôs price!!
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful dress. The only thing I‚Äôm having a problem with is the shoulder straps. But other than that it fits perfect! I love it.
4.0,good product at a fair price
4.0,"Not bad at all! Good for long hair, well weighted for windy days, arrived w/only 1 back in pkg -2 would be especially useful when dealing with winter clothes. Good product it seems."
4.0,"I really like this watch, my only complaint is the difficulty of setting the date."
4.0,Deben aclarar la descripci√≥n pq dice dos piezas y solo llego una
4.0,Pretty but small. Definitely a good value. I have received many compliments.
4.0,"This is a very pretty set. It is great for bridal as well as for other occasions. The only downside it has is that it's a pretty short necklace. When I saw it online, I didn't think it was going to be this short. Although, it has the extender, I wouldn't recommend this for people with wider necks, because it kind of looks weird, when you hook it from the extender, because the hook actually sits on the side of your neck, as opposed to your neck."
4.0,A great dress. I little large but just a fw adjustments and it will be perfect. Great quality and not forgetting timely shipping.  Will recommend this.
4.0,Very nice but if you fold it one time and it covers at the arc.
4.0,The band is a very nice upgrade to the rubber band that comes with the Fitbit Alta. I have had it for a week now and everything fits securely. I have worked out in it and have had no issues. I would have given it a 5 star rating but I had to return the first one.  It's clasp on one side was broken. I do recommend this band. My Fitbit is a small and the small band fits me fine...only slightly loose.
4.0,I really like this hat. The brim shadows my face and neck perfectly. It also washes well but needs to have the supports improved.
4.0,The design upon closer inspection was very cheap.
4.0,"It's nice. A little loose. Super pink, but it's a nice accessorie"
4.0,"Arrived early, fits well, no more cold feet. Wearing only these socks since they arrived. Great product (no oder), recommended to friends snd neighbors."
4.0,"Fits great, but shorter than expected. Nice shirt. Great quality, just short."
4.0,"Very attractive. Simple, but classy. I would have given them 5 stars, but one earring had a knot in the chain just in front of the bridge. I have a wonderful jeweler who got it out for me, free of charge."
4.0,Little bit bigger than what I had expected
4.0,Fit but little baggy go down a size
4.0,"I love the style of this dress. The sleeves are super cute and the tie at the waist makes it realy cinched and accentuates my body type perfectly. Because I am 6 ft tall and thick this dress is way too short to wear alone, so I style it with a pair of leggings. Of it was just a few inches longer it would be a 5 stars for me."
4.0,"Fit is generous, but I went up a size. Not thrilled with the way the shoulder/arm is finished. Otherwise, its as described. Can wear as beach cover or tunic with leggings."
4.0,Love these shoes!  Very comfortable and an amazing look
4.0,Almost Perfect
4.0,This is a good quality boot for the money.  Mine was a little bit too big but that is not the boot makers fault.  I would recommend this item.
4.0,"I really like this dress. It was a looser than expected in the chest, but still very cute. It's one that you can dress up or down. Very easy to get on and off. Incredibly comfortable."
4.0,"This was delivered very quickly, though the Keychain was smaller than I thought it would be.  It was a gift for my daughter, and she loved it!"
4.0,The rubbers hold the frame well don't sideline some.<br /><br />I do think the rubbers are too big as they tend to interfere with putting my glasses on by putting too<br /><br />much friction and pressure on the sides of my face.
4.0,Very cute soft sole shoes. They stay on very well.
4.0,The picture is a little hard to see and it's blurry. But for it being in a tiny little holder thing it's not bad !! The bracelet itself is very durable
4.0,"Just the right fit,  love it!"
4.0,"I knocked it down one star because it took so long to get here, 35 days. I actually forgot I had ordered it by the time it arrived. But it did come from china. It was also kind of small about half my palm in size and I'm 5'3. The other Ravenclaw patch is about 3 times lager. But i have to say the quality was amazing I love this one way better then the movie patch or the one you can by at IoA. This is the true colors of the house and the bird design doesn't look so spongebob quality cartoon-ish. It does look just like the picture. So over all I'm very happy with it. I completely recommend this as long as you have the time for the long shipping. *thumbs up*"
4.0,Got delivered to my work n I put them on and got tons of compliments ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ they look good with black hair
4.0,"Pretty, good size, great gift box. But very thin."
4.0,"Just received the product today. I got a size small and I'm 5'2.5"" 128 Ibs size 27"" waist. I did have to size down from my typical medium size. I own a few gymshark leggings. These fit just right, 7/8 length and comes right above my belly button. The elastic part of the waist is nice and compressive however I wish the rest of the material was the same way. Right below the elastic my lower abdomen tends to pop out a little more because the rest of the leggings are not compressive like the waist.<br />The material itself is a little thinner than what I had expected, but it is soft and not uncomfortable. Because of this, I'm not sure how well these leggings will hold up in the washer, weightlifting and core exercises. I will try a few washes and wears and give my second opinion after. Futher, the small dotted holes are not actually holes, they are darker dots printed onto the pants.<br />Overall, fit is great and accentuates the butt area. Very flattering! For the price, I did expect a slightly thicker material with a bit more compression -just because there are other leggings on Amazon that are &lt;$29. If you are not looking for too much compression or looking to wear these for light training, highly recommend.<br />Rated 3/5 for now because of material, if they hold up well in the long run will give 4/5 rating!<br /><br />UPDATE: decided to return these. material for the front end is too thin for me, and gives you camel toe.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: i was contacted by the seller. I received a second pair from a list of suggestions (i got khaki grey marl) and was told that these would be more compressive and have less camel toe. Upon trying them on, they were more compressive but they still did have camel toe. I suspect that even though i like the tighter fit I should size up to a medium to avoid camel toe. Otherwise, great customer service, seller seems to really care about its customers!! 4/5 stars."
4.0,"I ordered this Newdow Women‚Äôs Novelty Casual Print T- shirt for our daughter because she likes the unique print design on the top. She says she likes that the shirt fits her well, and that it is comfortable to wear, and soft, smooth and gentle on her skin. She says that she likes the quality of the T- shirt and it seems to be made of good 100% cotton materials. She says the shirt looks great on her, and she likes the round neck design, the double-needle sleeves and the bottom hem. She says she likes that it matches almost all her jeans and pants and shoes and her fashion accessories. She  says that she has been wearing them often, and she washed them several times and it still looks good with quality and print intact. So far, so good, and I would recommend it."
4.0,IT FITS MY PANDORA BRACELET JUST FINE.
4.0,I wish the material was of a better quality. The rest was pretty good.
4.0,I like them all tho the yellow pair leaks air in to your eyes by the inner corner .
4.0,"I ordered my regular clothing size knowing that this dress would be very loose-fitting.  It's very loose indeed, but the color is beautiful, the length perfect and the material is very soft and comfortable."
4.0,This dress was so cute try on time. I got it for my day celebration and it held my curves well but it‚Äôs a little stretchy and thin. It‚Äôs so cute I thought of keeping it but two have my seamstress do a thing with it but my daughter said no lol. I‚Äôm returning it but may come back to it. I say get your size and size down see and for some it may not be too thin at all it‚Äôs my preference.
4.0,Good quality. Runs a tad bit small.
4.0,"If my review is helpful, please click the YES button below!<br />I bought this set as a gift for my niece as she loves to get dressed up and wear earrings.<br />This pack comes with 8 different pairs of color earrings with stainless steel backings.<br />They are petite and look great.<br />She loves them and for the price, you can‚Äôt go wrong.<br />They come in different sizes and I bought the 4mm ones and i would not go smaller.<br />They also came individually wrapped in plastic and all the pairs were in a nice velvet bag.<br /><br />This is my honest opinion and I do think that this is a great product.<br />I did receive this product at a discount for an unbiased review.<br />Thank you!"
4.0,I love the color of this dress! Did run a bit small in the arms and much shorter in the front. I will be keeping and just wearing with leggings instead. Arms I just stretched out the stitching.
4.0,This blouse is soft and very comfortable. The fit is good and the sleeves are a good length.
4.0,"it's nice, it fits snug, but it definitely works under clothes.  the lace is lovely and it comes mid thigh."
4.0,"This is a cute dress with flouncy fabric and I appreciate that it has a built in slip liner. It was a little shapeless for me, but I am in between sizes and picked my larger size. I think that in the smaller size it would fit better.<br /><br />If you are also in between sizes, I‚Äôd recommend sizing down.<br /><br />I think this would be flattering on a lot of different body types, it has a defined waist but isn‚Äôt clingy anywhere."
4.0,I like the fashion statement these glasses make......they look great.
4.0,"Fit just as expected and is really cute, if you wanna get it just do it, it's worth it. I have a small chest but am 5'8 and 160 pounds."
4.0,"Super cute but order a size up, mine was almost too small!"
4.0,"I like the shirt, a tad scratchy but i have not washed it yet.  A little big but that is ok as i dont like items tight"
4.0,"Dress is light weight and comfortable, fits big get a smaller size"
4.0,I wish I would have tried it on prior to the event I wore it to. I would have exchanged for a bigger size. Thankfully I was able to get it one and the look was nice even though I looked like I stuffed myself into at the time
4.0,Pretty dope
4.0,"Very cute if you can keep them on their feet.......bigger than expected(for a 6 mo. old), but I will shorten the elastic and they should be fine."
4.0,Pretty & functional product
4.0,"Just the right size for a couple credit cards, business cards, license and keeps money crisp. I appreciate minimalism. Outside pocket is where I keep my primary Visa-Debit card with my bank for regular transactions and ATM withdrawals. I removed the big money clip and do not use that feature. Instead, I simply insert my cash, folded once in the middle, into the center of wallet. I like the color a lot. Wallet is sturdy."
4.0,Awesome dress! Super comfortable and warm enough for winter. I just love it! Can be worn high or low hem.
4.0,"Love this bikini..I am 5‚Äô8 122 pounds and 32DD..I originally ordered the blue in medium but the top was too small. I sized up with the red and the top fits fine, however the bottoms are just a tad too big. I‚Äôll make it work because It‚Äôs not that big of a deal I just wish we had the option to purchase different sizes in the tops and bottoms."
4.0,Bought this item for my boyfriend and it is now his favorite hoodie. He says it is warm and comfortable. Item is well made and fits well.
4.0,"It's very comfortable,  and shows just enough skin without going overboard"
4.0,Nice basic jacket but only for chilly weather.  Not warm enough for colder days.
4.0,"Fits, is cute, havent used yet."
4.0,"I like this sleeve a lot. The only thing that it is extremely hard to put on and take off.  Once I get it on it feels great.  I purchased a large and probably should have gotten an extra large.  I have purchased two more sleeves by other companies 1 is From Fly in an extra large (gray color)and I had no trouble getting it on or off.  The other one was a Dimok Calf Compression sleeve in the red white & blue M-L one and it is a good fit also - but had to have help from my husband taking it off.  I wondered if I could stretch the top and bottom of your sleeves and it would be perfect.  My evaluation is that I like the look and feel of your sleeve the best but it is just too hard to get on (takes me 30 min.) and off (have to get my husband to pull it off for me.  I wrote you all but didn't hear back suggesting that you make the top and bottom just a tad larger but never heard back from you all. The first day I wore your sleeve it made my ankles swell and left marks on my legs at the top and the bottom and bruising on my calves.  I think I told you that I got them because I have Venus Insufficientcy and the large was I think too small.Even with all that I do like your sleeve (once I get it on) the best - it looks good- doesn't have writing all over it which is a plus.  I may order an extra large from you all when my daughter comes home from her vacation and gives them all a look see.  She is a bike rider, tennis player and yoga person who wears sleeves and she can tell me which is the best for me."
4.0,"Cute outfit. Cheap material, but we use it for dress up"
4.0,Easy to return size 26 with two small size 27 too big
4.0,"First off, it‚Äôs small. I wear a size 38dd and it was just too small. I would size up 1 size, but I am also 2 weeks postpartum. Despite that, I love it. I love that I can choose between pumping hands-free or breastfeeding. Truly secure hands-free."
4.0,"Nice earrings.  I got them for my mother who is in a nursing home hoping that she wouldn't be able to get them out.  I am not sure how she got them out, but she did.  Of the 4 sets, only 2 are wearable in ears--the others are for piercings."
4.0,"The Riwissipa clip on magnifiers came in a nice cloth carry case, with a hard plastic case inside, and included a microfiber cloth. They easily attach to my glasses via silicone protected clips, and flip up and down as I need them. A real easy solution for times I can't quite see the fine detail in what I'm reading or working on."
4.0,"These are truly small, but perfect for work and travel because while attractive, they will not snag or be pulled by hair, putting on coats and scarves. The trinity knot is beautifully done, the silver has taken on the soft patina that silver gets when it is worn often.  I bought these to remind myself of a trip to Ireland."
4.0,A little smaller<br />Then normal sizing
4.0,"This skirt is nice, but it is too long and kind of big in the waist. I'm 5'4&#34; 140lbs for reference. It is not see through. I love the pockets. I will need to have it hemmed before I can wear it. The material is thicker, but not too thick."
4.0,Great item and quality but if I hadn't know to heat up the plastic it would have not fit my son
4.0,"These boots are really cute and they are perfect for what I bought them for. The gold detail is a nice touch and definitely makes them look classy. They have a slight plastic scent that goes away once they are out of the box.<br /><br />As far as fitting goes, they are tight around the calves and feel a little narrow in the foot area sometimes-- I'm still trying to break them in, but I'm not worried. For the price, this shoe is incredible and with care, I think they'll last me awhile. Definitely looking forward to seeing what other shoes Dream Pairs is selling. ‚úåüèª"
4.0,"It is my birth stone,  which made it so easy to pick.  And last l didn't like the stone hanging off but l just clipped it."
4.0,So far they are doing what they are supposed to do which is be sunglasses and they fit over my regular glasses.  I have not used the night vision ones yet but I am sure they will work just fine as well.  I had gotten a pair of these years ago and 2 weeks ago my other ones finally cracked.  The only difference I can see is the plastic especially the arms seem cheaper than before.
4.0,"The item is just as pictured! It‚Äôs gorgeous on as well, the reason for 4 stars is like others the bust area is a little small!!!"
4.0,Nice  and I'm glad the elephant turned silver after wearing it ‚ù£
4.0,Love the shirt. The design is perfectly placed and sized. After the first wash the design cracked in a few spots but it still looks good.
4.0,Great Design.  Good Quality
4.0,Works well and cleans easily.
4.0,"SUPER CUTE, EASY TO PUT ON, AND THE STONE IS BEAUTIFUL.  GLAD I BOUGHT IT."
4.0,I love the price and quality!
4.0,Nephew liked it.  All that matters.
4.0,Simple to use to do basic labels
4.0,"Sorry it was a gift for my daughter however, she loved them."
4.0,Just as discrib
4.0,Nice quality material but fits too small
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good quality hat and the color is a deep rich orange. I love it. I would have given 5 stars, but it‚Äôs runs quite big and I had to wash and dry (monitoring closely) to shrink it to a size that is normal fitting."
4.0,As expected. Wrapped perfectly
4.0,"For the price, this is a great dress! The fabric is fairly heavy, but feels very light on, even in the heat (so far). I‚Äôm looking forward to wearing it more as the weather gets warmer and see how it feels in even hotter weather. It does has a t-shirt fabric feel to it, without looking cheap.<br />I hung it to dry after washing on a delicate cycle and it was wrinkly, but a bit of wrinkle release spray straightened it out nicely.<br />Overall, this is a very nice dress without spending a lot!"
4.0,Nice graphics and nice fit
4.0,"A little heavy, but other than that they work perfectly. Just like on the Bucket List movie. Really fun to use."
4.0,"This is a cute bathing suit. As always with online clothes, it does run a bit on the small side. I am usually a M-L so I ordered a large and it just fit. A little snug but an extra large I think would be too big. The one weird thing I noticed is it has individual cups to support your bust, but they are not sewn to the fabric. They just sit there in between the layers of fabric and they move around. I don‚Äôt know if this is intentional by design so you can adjust them to where your bust is. If they do not stay put after a few wears I was thinking of putting in a few stiches on the inside layer of fabric to hold them in place."
4.0,"The hat is really cute, just way too small for an adult to wear."
4.0,So these were amazing when I got them. They Fit PERFECT! And the quality seems to be really nice! BUT after I washed them they shrunk to like an extra small sizeüòÇ which I can squeez into and try stretching out BUT BECAUSE THE STUPID MATERIAL IS SO NICE AND THICK ITS HARD AS HELL TO STRETCH. maybe I should order a large and wash them and just hope they fit?? Because they really are soooo cute
4.0,"Cute, casual, n comfy  dress. Quality decent for the cost, and the fit is loose but flattering. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 160 lbs 36 DD, and this fits me well"
4.0,"The white material is rather thin, but it's a great blouse otherwise!  I just have to wear a cami underneath for it to work."
4.0,My son always wears the ski mask for warmth during the colder months and I thought this would help as well. It is light weight and says it has sweat absorption. I think it would be good for wearing especially under his motorcycle helmet for sure.
4.0,Perfect for what I needed it for - wearing to get my hair and makeup done before a wedding. It‚Äôs really thin material which I don‚Äôt mind but others might and it feels a bit boxy and big when wearing.
4.0,"The pants runs to long is very nice but no for me I am 5,4 I ordered small maybe for a tall lady"
4.0,muy  suave  y de buen  ajuste.
4.0,Very good. My boyfriend loves it.
4.0,I liked them for my 3 year old.  I liked them until one broke at the hinge so i had to buy a different type of earring.that is more sturdy
4.0,I have only had then for a few days but have owned over 6 pairs in my life and this is solid. Comfortable and looks good. If they hold up well they will be a really good buy
4.0,"I ordered a size up from what I normally wear after reading mixed reviews and they‚Äôre just right. Ordering bigger is also helpful if you like to wear winter socks with your slippers. Basic house slippers, they keep your feet nice and warm."
4.0,"I ordered a pair of these in medium.  I am about as standard a medium as there is but  they were to big.  I returned them and ordered the small, and have really been pleased with the fit of these and the overall quality and appearance of the pants.  So I recommend this product but order a size below what you usually do."
4.0,Exactly what I wanted. I think it looks better in person than it did online. It came in fast and looks great. Definitely recommend it for a nurse or new graduate.
4.0,"I'm a 5'9"" male, 155 pounds and ordered a size small. I almost always wear a small for clothes. This fits comfortably on arms, legs, and chest and is nice and slim so it can go under clothes in the winter but the torso is too short so it's tight over the shoulders and in the groin especially when worn to sleep."
4.0,"Si lo que buscas es un reloj barato esta es tu opci√≥n...<br />Saludos desde USA, a todo M√©xico"
4.0,"Liked the dress. It's not too short. The only thing it was on the top, that I thought it was missing something... And the cape, came with a little hole on it, but anyone could see it."
4.0,"These shoe trees feel solid and well-made. The wood itself is fragrant and sanded smooth. No worry of getting splinters here.<br /><br />The only thing I could knock this product on is the sizing. I ordered the size 9-10, and it fits very very snug in my size 9 shoes. Some shoes I'm almost afraid that it will overstretch the heel. I recommend ordering assuming that the fit is for the higher end of the range."
4.0,IT WAS SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT STILL A NEAT PIECE
4.0,"Was working for FedEx at the time, it held up great until one day, I set a box down and was walking back to my truck when it just fell off my wrist. The strap broke off from the main face. Also, runs ever so slightly slow, BUT that's better than fast. Amazing look though, and would definitely buy again."
4.0,Love these they are comfy cute and I don't worry about slipping I have ceramic floors and they work well on them
4.0,This would've been perfect if it hadn't run so big. I could have easily gone down a full size minimum.
4.0,Haven't used this bag yet- appears to be a nice purse.
4.0,I really like the glasses and the whole lightweight wood thing but I am not too sure about the design.  The circle thing in the center is kinda weird and the frames are quite large on my small face.  Overall quality product and good price!
4.0,Definitely thin fabric. And the tassels fell off after washing. So now its just a string. Not as cute.
4.0,"Very cute! Fit me well. Could be a little thicker, but the pieces do lay over each other a little! Will be a great cover up for a hot day at the beach!!"
4.0,Was a bit larger in chest but I bought a size up.  Great for the price
4.0,"Really cute outfit. Shirt isn‚Äôt thin, nice quality for the money. However, order up at least 1 size. I ordered a 2T/3T for my daughter who normally wears a 2T and I ordered a 3T/4T for my daughter who normally wears a 3T and both skirts were super tight. The 3T/4T skirt was even snug on my smaller daughter and I couldn‚Äôt even get it buttoned on my bigger daughter. The straps were a nice fit though, I was worried they‚Äôd fall down but there wasn‚Äôt much slack. Cute outfit, just make sure to go up."
4.0,Hard to put on and I'm small
4.0,A little 'thick' I like thin breezy cotton (if that makes sense) it is a little clingy but cute.
4.0,Very cute but flimsy pants and tighter then we wanted
4.0,I'm very happy with this product.  Most local stores do not carry 3.00 and I'm glad to have different colors.
4.0,My husband likes en
4.0,"Extremely static, but super cute."
4.0,"I like it but..I didn't realize the sleeves were only 3 quarter length and it wasn't as large as I had expected. If you want the bigger sweatshirt look definitely order a size or two up. It's still cute, just not completely as expected."
4.0,"I'm usually an XL, so I bought an XL, and it was pretty big on me, so definitely order a size down. Cute dress. Goes down to my knee. Not exactly what I was looking for, so I returned it and didn't buy again, but it's a nice dress."
4.0,Too big for my head. I am a petit kind of person. I have to use this over a hat.
4.0,Great jumpsuit. It is very comfortable and loose fitting. Like wearing pajamas but cute! The fabric is stretchy and it runs large. I would size down.
4.0,"These were just as depicted - very tiny though.  Colorful and fun shapes.<br />I deducted one star just because the individual bags rolled up and sticky-sealed were SO annoying and aggrevating to open.<br />While some may want them separated, I would rather separate myself than go through that again!<br />Picture tiny little baggies, sealed with sticky, then rolled up like miniature cigarettes.<br />My fingers are too old and arthritic for that headache LOL<br />But the gems themselves were good - just really small."
4.0,Exactly as pictures and described
4.0,"Nicely packaged, exactly as shown, great price!"
4.0,"Just great. Good value, attractive, seems sturdy. Most importantly she loves it. ZYooh shipped this crazy fast, much earlier than anticipated, thanks."
4.0,Sizing is correct. Comfortable boots. They look good. A good value
4.0,Real glass polarized lenses. Crystal clear and comfortable. Good price.
4.0,I like my necklace.  Wish I would have read the description better.  It's a really long necklace.  Now I guess I know what a &#34;sweater necklace&#34; is!  I do prefer a shorter one.
4.0,i wear a medium and the large it tighter than i like
4.0,"Worked well.  Stayed on mask in and out of the water.  Ordered a 1.5 mag. and at that small magnification, you may not need it at all when scuba diving since everything is already magnified slightly underwater."
4.0,Gift for the hubby which he loved!
4.0,The fit is great but the quality of the lining is poor
4.0,Perfect size for your tote. It does flip up in extreme wind
4.0,Fits as excepted everywhere except for the arms. They are a little snug. I loved the print and style so I'll keep it but just a heads up :)
4.0,It's an ok dress. Looks better in the pic
4.0,"My daughter has tripped a couple times and the toes are already scuffed up. She still loves to wear them, so I assume they are comfortable"
4.0,grrreat!
4.0,"The style is cute.  Bought one of brown and one black.  Had to get the calves stretched as mine are thicker, but worth it for the price."
4.0,I was a monkey and my baby a banana it caused many laughs.  The costume fit great.  I was bigger than I expected but that was a good thing.  Very comfortable
4.0,The girls liked them
4.0,Same as pic love it and the material is OK for the price
4.0,It fits very well! There was a whole on the seam on the neck area. We sewed it.
4.0,"I mainly ordered these because I have a new light purple shirt and the color shown looked exact to the shirt.  Well, the orchid/light purple earring is as pale and dull a purple as can be----nothing like the picture, and the blue is almost navy.  None of the colors look like the picture shown.  Nice earrings, though, but don't have high expectations of getting those exact colors.  Here is the ""PURPLE"" on the left and the ""BRIGHT BLUE"" on the right."
4.0,Good quality but a little bulkier than expected.
4.0,Super cute for couple keychain
4.0,I like it.ive gotten many compliments on it.
4.0,This is like many Hawaiian Makau (fish hook) necklaces that are sold on the Islands and if you like the shape as I do then I recommend it.
4.0,I love the shirt however I think there was a printing defect on the one I received. There are somewhat large white stripes in the shoulder area where it looks like the shirt as wrinkled when it was dyed.
4.0,Arrived with inside contents shifted but was fine upon assembling.  Overall I like this box. The wood is beautiful and the motor is silent. The key and lock doesn't work very well so I don't think that will be used much.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:2f0b0c32794237973afaa1a24621ea23]] its larger than what i thought but i like it cause right now my hairs in a half up do so this works great. The only problem is that i ordered a black one and it hasn't come yet and the shipping takes longer than i thought.
4.0,These gold dangle earrings are what I've been looking for.  They are light weight and I forget I am wearing them; I think they are very attractive.
4.0,I bought 2 shirts one blue one green they both say 3 xL but the blue one is more like a 2xl I should of sent it back as it's to small but I donated it to goodwill instead
4.0,To short for me but product is good.
4.0,Looks great on my wife! Would recommend!
4.0,Very cute! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 140 and the medium fits perfect
4.0,Wish it was a litter larger/longer for the size but still wearable.
4.0,The heart is super heavy and bigger than expected but it‚Äôs still a cute necklace.
4.0,Roomy and warm
4.0,"Really nice, I bought this for my boyfriend but the chain is a little too tight around his neck. He's going to put the pendant onto a new chain so it's more comfortable."
4.0,"Beautiful headpiece. If your daughter doesn't like the feel of a comb holding it in place, then this isn't the one for her. It didn't stay in my daughter's hair very well,  but if you take your time it works nicely."
4.0,Beautiful earrings-lightweight just bigger than I thought they would be.
4.0,"I‚Äôm Usually a medium across all brands. 140 , 5‚Äô6‚Äù. I got the large in hopes of being baggy. NOPE! Although the waist is wide elastic it is SO tight! Like, uncomfortably tight and made my stomach ache after wearing for a day. Also Has a working drawstring -which I can‚Äôt imagine anyone needing to use.<br />Legs fit perfect, length is perfect and material is very soft and comfy. Please fix the waistband!"
4.0,nice jacket but small for me
4.0,"For an inexpensive dress-up item, they're fairly sturdy and well-made.  I got the medium size lenses, and they were quite a bit bigger than I expected.  If I were ordering another pair, I'd definitely go with the small.  Don't get the large unless ""oversized comedy prop"" is the look you're going for."
4.0,"I do like this dress. Although the one drawback is that it's made cheaply.  I have to be very careful when wearing it. It's easy to hear threads tearing when I make any adjustments.<br />It does fit well, is comfy, and a little sexy. üòÅ"
4.0,I wear this ring often. It goes with everything and the quality is very nice.
4.0,Fits smaller than I thought
4.0,"My kiddo loves all things video game related.  This shirt is comfortable, fits well and has the characters he loves"
4.0,Arrived on time and the price was great.
4.0,Watch is good for the cost but the tool that separates the links bends easily and to separate the links is very difficult.
4.0,Its what I expected. A little big in the stomach area though
4.0,It's OK but around the edges was very rough have to file it to get it smooth could cut in your flesh
4.0,good quality got to order smaller i thought it would be smaill but its exactly too big
4.0,I use these to walk dogs in rain or snow.. they are big on me but the belt keeps them from falling down.. they need a size 26..
4.0,"I am impressed with the product and features.  This luggage is somewhere in between lightweight and fragile (IT Luggage) and lightweight luggage priced at $400-$800. All 3 categories (cheap-fragile-lightweight to expensive-stronger-lightweigtht) weigh in at about 4.5 pounds, with spinner wheels. My needs?  Lightweight 4-8 spinner wheels, use the bag on board fo domestic flights, and have a tough enough bag for storage below for international travel. This 4.5 pounder checks those boxes.  However, if you do not need 4 wheel spinner bags, and are on a budget, look around.  You will find some excellent nylon 2 wheel, small, duffle bags for under $50 from major companies (you recognize).  Can you take this on board?  The material will bend a little.. Weight at about 4.5 pounds is comparable to the weight of ultra high end luggage, ultra light weight spinners  (Hartman and some German brands). This bag, however, is used by me, not as a carry-on, but for use underneath because it is tough enough to stand up to abuse. Worth 5 stars?  Give me more time with the product. Bonus?  It does have an expandable zipper, hidden inside, that gives flexibility to make this bag larger.  Same company also sells a few sizes of duffle bags with 2 wheels that are worth consideration. However, the competition offers some other  excellent 2 wheel duffles on the market for remarkably low prices....$30-$90."
4.0,"This is a really cute purse. I get a lot of compliments about the size and color (light pink). Only thing is the zipper broke after about 2 weeks, so super bummed."
4.0,"I am impressed with this dress. The material is supersoft and of decent quality. I did not expect it to be as nice based on the price. I am glad I purchased. I did get a medium, and next time I will get a large simply because it is a little tight in the chest. It is a true cap Sleeve, so it‚Äôs open in the armpit area with the sleeve only covering the shoulders. Overall I am happy with it. It is great over leggings."
4.0,The toos straps are very thin so if you hve big boobs they wont hold up very well. The material is kind of cheap and the lace kind be lind of itchy (especially the shorts if you sit on them for a ehile)
4.0,"The bands seem to be really well made. The only thing I really didn't care for, was the length. The band was a bit too long, so it stuck out a little too much."
4.0,Great for the price. I did have to trim quite a few threads hanging off of it before my son could wear it. Perfect for a teen or young man.
4.0,Very comfortabl
4.0,lovely slipper but purchased for a woman who is reliably size 5.  These were tight for her so we had to return.  Sadly this color was only available ins size 6 at full price so we found it in pink on sale from a different vendor.
4.0,"Really soft material but unflattering on this 4 month post party belly! Instead of highlighting the booty the middle of the fabric drew too much attention to my stomach. I got the Grey in a L and it did fit well, but a medium could have given a more snug fit."
4.0,I love the bling of the purse but my second wear the handle broke
4.0,Once I learned how to get them on I was very happy with them. Seem a bit short in the feet.  But quite effective.
4.0,"I bought these as present for my niece. She wears a size 6 which would normally be a medium, but after reading the reviews about the small sizing I got her an extra large. I'm glad I did because they fit her perfectly. She absolutely loved them!"
4.0,"Love the top, it just fits more snuggly than I normally wear."
4.0,I really like the colored crystals.  My lava beads broke but the customer service at SPUNKYsoul was quick to offer a replacement.
4.0,"i ordered three of the LIGE watches. I like the look. but on the gold and silver one, { which I have not worn yet }<br />The batterie is dead. I have only had them for three weeks."
4.0,"The hat looked the same way it dI'd online.  There was a little glue showing, but other than that nice hat."
4.0,"This bikini is so cute and sexy and the top fits fine, but the bottoms were a bit snug on me."
4.0,"I bought these for hand protection when sparring and they aren't the best because the palm has rubber protection as well which makes it slightly harder to change grip with a sword. Additionally my hands get sweaty in the gloves, but that isn't too much of a bother. Other than that, they are good for protection and i like them."
4.0,good quality for the price you pay for!
4.0,Happy with the slippers.
4.0,"I think I should‚Äôve gone with the smaller size. I knew this had a very baggy, loose fitting design, but I didn‚Äôt think about where it would land on my body versus the model. The model is much taller than I am, and at 5‚Äò4‚Äú, I basically look like a potato. If I were super skinny bone thin, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt matter, but the hole look is kind of a mess on me. With a smaller size, I think it might‚Äôve landed a little higher up and looked better, but as it is right now, it‚Äôs not really the most flattering thing on me. Cool concept though!"
4.0,The three C's of gemstone importance when considering a purcase were met.<br />The photo image shows a flash of red which mine does not posses and would have then given a 4/12 star rating.<br />The price was reasonable due to the specialty cut.<br />It came well packaged with the information card.
4.0,"Great quality but so tiny. If you're getting it to make a statement in pictures, please don't."
4.0,The necklace is reallly long when I got it so I fixed it up kinda into a choker and everybody seems to love it! I get lots of compliments on it(:
4.0,"This is a very well made hat with nice logo and graphics.  I was disappointed to se that a US Army Official License hat would be made in Vietnam.  Had I known the hat was made in Vietnam I would not have purchased it, but that is my fault for not researching before I purchased it."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a liiiittle see through, but not bad at all! Just wear a nude colored bra underneath and it‚Äôs all good!"
4.0,So far so good! I have very sensitive skin and allergies to nickel and so far I have not had an allergic reaction to this chocker. It looks nice and it just right for the price.
4.0,Bought these as a gift for somebody and they love it . Nice quality
4.0,"It does fit looser than I'd like... I was told to size up but since it's backless it should be a little tighter. 36 bust, 31 inch waist, 41 inch hips"
4.0,"Does its job, and I even got some compliments on it.  I think the wings on it might be just a touch too wide, but it's still a good purchase for those of us who don't like stabbing a tack through our ties."
4.0,"Nice, although after first wash it will shrink a little."
4.0,"They are good quality, shiny, bigger than I figured but I am happy with my new earrings. Yes I would recommend them to people who like the bigger studs so they stand out. The color of the stone is good to me."
4.0,love it but it runs small
4.0,"Make sure you look at sizes and length,I love this top it's super cute!! I get compliments on it all the time:)"
4.0,"The quality of the balls are just styrofoam but they where super easy to put on the wig, and the horns are hollow in the center, however, they are light weight and super comfy to wear, over all I liked it"
4.0,"These same jeans also come in a stone wash and mid blue, which look similar to this, but they are also all just a little bit different color wise.  These have that ‚Äúbuilt-in wrinkle‚Äù look to them.  A bit darker around the seams.  They are 98%  cotton and 2% elastane.  With only 2% elastane they still have some ‚Äúcomfort stretch‚Äù for bending and sitting.  Not super soft, but not really ‚Äúhard‚Äù either.  They are Made in China, so a bit pricey.  Straight leg for a slimmer fit, but certainly not skinny."
4.0,"I like the material and design of the garment.  I was concerned when ordering it since men's large was the smallest size offered.  It turned out that large is more like a usual size medium, so that works for me.<br />I tried to order this set in white also but size large is currently unavailable."
4.0,Material is very comfortable. Just as described.
4.0,My daughter is 5 and it fit her perfectly. I would mention that it is very sheer so plan to have something underneath skirt as well if you're not using it over a leotard.
4.0,"The glasses are great, perfect for a large head. Lenses seem a bit better than cheaper glasses.  Would have been a five star review except the ear pieces are difficult to adjust."
4.0,Pretty charms
4.0,"Nice fit, shorts are pretty thin though."
4.0,The scarf was a good quality. They were too big for my face.
4.0,I love these glasses. Only issue is they are tight on my temples.
4.0,Nice color and weight for fall into winter.
4.0,SHE LIKED THEM
4.0,"Nice hat , warm and well made , but I wear a 7-5/8 fitted hat<br />So it is a little tight , but still works"
4.0,I like these a lot. Use them anytime I‚Äôm driving st night. They reduce the glare from incoming cars headlights while also making it brighter in dark areas. I thought they would make it better to see when raining at nighttime but they only help a little bit. For any other time driving they are great. Rain/night/cloudy the brightness helps see so much better while making sure you don‚Äôt get blinded by headlights
4.0,"I really dig this little hat. I want one in burgundy, when such a color becomes available let me know"
4.0,"Got them today. Good thing I read the reviews that said they fit small, I ordered the next size up and they fit perfect.  Wore them around for a 1/2 hr, very comfortable. When walking, the knee pads are a little low so they feel awkward, not bad, just awkward.  In sitting position, they move up and feel good so while riding they will be fine. The pads are removable so if they bother me, I'll take them out.  The side pads fit and feel fine.  Overall, not a bad pant for the price. mat get the jeans model next, it says they have adjustable height knee pads."
4.0,"I love the shape of the dress, it also has great length. It doesn't make me look boxy like a lot of other t-shirt dresses. One downfall is that it is a bit see-through."
4.0,"Great looking watch for the money. The band is a little cumbersome, but once you figure it out, it‚Äôs easy."
4.0,"Very comfortable.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and hits me right below my knee, which is perfect for me. Lightweight, will be great for summer. It was very inexpensive, so it‚Äôs hard to complain about much, but I will say that it looks a little cheap, but again for the price, I can‚Äôt complain."
4.0,"I do love this dress but the first time I wore it, I felt like I shd have worn my Disney Minnie mouse ears with it. I did get compliments on it though & it's certainly flattering! Beware, the red skirt is fairly sheer--i wore a slip with it. One doorway & everyone will see your everything underneath if you don't ü§¶"
4.0,"A very cute dress, it looks very much like the picture shows. My only complaint is that the zipper wouldn't completely zip about half way up the seam. It zipped when I was out of the dress but wouldn't when I was wearing it, not even with the help of a 2nd person. I was afraid that I would have to return it except that luckily the material is quite stretchy and I was able to slip it over my head with the zipper already zipped. The dress fits nicely, hugging around the bottom of the rib cage and then flaring out slightly to hide any tummy that sticks out. Due to the neck line and sleeves one would definitely have to wear a strapless bra with this, however the material is thick enough that you could probably go without if not too well endowed in the chest area. I am 5'6&#34; and around 160lbs with an athletic build and a medium fit me perfectly."
4.0,"Physically it looks similar to picture shown. Quality exceed my expectation for the price I paid, good value for money."
4.0,"This is a lovely organizer that can hold a lot of things! It came packaged securely with foam and plastic. Each piece was individually wrapped too. The instructions provided have pictures and words to help guide you through the assembling process. It was fairly quick to put together, and the acrylic plastic is nice and thick in most places. The most fragile parts are the shelves and the walls. The only issue I had was when installing the shelves at different heights, one of the shelves got stuck in the grooves and would NOT come out. I wiggled it, I gently pushed it, I tried it from different angles, too. I didn't want to crack the intersecting walls, when trying to move a shelf. It seems that some of the pre-cut slots are not entirely even and perfect. This makes the shelves get stuck in certain grooves. Thankfully I was finally able to pry it out and move it, but you have to be extremely careful when doing so. The plastic is thick and durable compared to other brands, but you still have to be very light handed when assembling, maintaining, and moving it. It spins fairly smooth (minus a little creaking and slowing, occasionally.) The little rubber bands provided are decent for keeping the moving parts secure. Extra rubber bands are included too which is nice. It's a pretty good system to dismantle the organizer when moving/packing it away! Overall I'm highly satisfied with this clear acrylic cosmetic organizer. I give it 4 out of 5 stars for fairly easy assembly, decent quality for the price, and large storage capacity. I recommend this seller and item to anyone looking for a great way to keep their products more tidy and neat!"
4.0,This ring is very pretty and looks just like an antique ring.  I love it.  Only complaint is that it is not 3.20 ctw.  At most it is 1.5 ctw total.  Still a very nice ring for the price.
4.0,"Very unique and nice shirt for work.<br />The bottom is robed (one part going over another part), but it still looks very nice."
4.0,"Good quality, well made, warm winter hat with liner but wish it came in a bigger size. Was a little too snug for my husband who needs larger size hats."
4.0,"Great for the beach, though its a little shorter than I expected."
4.0,"Fits as it should. Good quality for a great price. Color is true to pics. Pocket holes for front pocket could be bigger, pocket size is good just the openings to access it could be larger. but other than that no complaints."
4.0,"The mask itself no complaints about, good quality but it runs a bit big even for a guy that takes a 7 5/8 hat size.  I took the straps off one of the rivets for each strap allowing for it to be tight enough, and just trimmed the jawline with scissors, as it had an overhang prior.  Nothing too complicated and quite satisfied."
4.0,Item was to heavy for my wife. She is a small woman anyway. Purchased another item she really likes.
4.0,Nice light weight sweater.  Ordered regular  size I always wear.<br />It ran b a bought snug .
4.0,"Its a beautiful purse. I was sad however that it wasnt silver. It says silver but its white with gold specks and gold hardware. I really wanted silver. Like I said its a beautiful and roomy purse. Lots of pockets for storage, and well made."
4.0,I love the way it fits and flow.
4.0,Very durable. My husbands takes it when he travels. Could use pockets though.
4.0,It's more of a dark red but the fabric is soft and comfy. I'd size up especially if you know your belly will be growing
4.0,"This bra is really soft. The fit is a bit baggy in the armpits, i think because the straps are long, but the cup isn't big enough. I still gave it 4 stars because maybe it fits others better and the quality and even packaging of this bra is great."
4.0,I have wide hips (14) and a small waist (M) and I bought an XL but it couldn't get down my hips so I wear it as a top and I love it!
4.0,"Attractive and warm; legs and sleeves too long for me, but I‚Äôll hem the legs. My daughter says I look adorable; I‚Äôll take it. I bought a 3X (240; 5‚Äô5‚Äù) and that worked for me (except for the over-long legs)."
4.0,"I really like this skirt, but the size fits smaller than other items I‚Äôve purchased from Persit. Other than that, the quality is good & the color is as described."
4.0,"Nice shoes. The only thing is that the zipper on one of them gets open a bit while walking. Otherwise great product. I usually wear 8.5 or 9, I took size 8.5 and they fit perfectly"
4.0,They were darker than what I thought
4.0,"I was honestly expecting something really cheap looking, but this is nice. Can't beat it for the money."
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt as light reflective as the photo‚Äôs suggest but is genuine labradorite.  It is quite pretty.  Elastic seems to be thick and sturdy...unfortunately it seems to catch and pull on every tiny hair on my wrist and arm due to the design making the stones act like tweezers, and it can be quite painful to wear.  I perhaps should have gone for a rounded bead type of bracelet instead."
4.0,"very pretty, good value for money. I dunno how long it will last though, BUT it is very good quality for the price."
4.0,"They are very thin, they have a zipper and tiny hook with a loop on the side. That was not in the description......."
4.0,It took about a month to come but that was expected.  I was also sent an open piece of candy which was thoughtful but I had to toss it.  The earring was very well put together  and the detail is lovely.  I would order from this company again.
4.0,Got it as a gift and it looks and fits great! The only problem with the hat is if you order it in beige it's more of a light grey than beige color
4.0,I purchased this to use when I needed the accessorized look but didn't want to carry a high dollar watch.  Pleased with it for the price.
4.0,"I like the design of these, but they are mostly polyester.  The tag is very scratchy and uncomfortable."
4.0,"This is a cute dress and I so wish it had fit.  I'm a size 6, and 5'4&#34; and it was so large that it didn't stay up on top.  Sadly I had to return it.  The colors were great and the style was cute.  I only wish they had more than just the one size."
4.0,Great for golf on cold days.
4.0,Love this !! Wearing it for my birthday !!
4.0,The shoe broke fairly quickly but they are very comfortable and fit smaller than they should.
4.0,Really tiny and beatifull.
4.0,"These were nice for the week they lasted.<br />I tend to bite on them every now and them on accident mostly.<br />After still having to take them in and out everyday for my job they got stripped and the half ball wouldn't stay on the bar anymore.<br />They were nice, I personally just prefer metal bars."
4.0,Pretty. but I thought I had ordered clip-ons
4.0,"Be warned while this is an awesome necklace, it is quite big."
4.0,"It shipped earlier than expected, but the box was really crushed. The helmet is deformed. I believe it can be fixed though."
4.0,Great value for the price!<br /><br />And included free socks!
4.0,A bit long but a beautiful dress.  Love the cap sleeve.  I wish it didn't have pockets but it fit well.  Can these dresses be offered in other colors?  A nice chocolate brown or army or forest green would be lovely.  Thanks!
4.0,"This is a pretty cute anklet...my only complaint is that it is not very long for an ankle bracelet.  I don't have a large ankle so it fits me, but there is really no room to adjust it at all.  I would not recommend for anyone with a larger frame."
4.0,The shirt is what you expect.  Good color and stitching.  I washed it to remove wrinkles from shipping.  It looks fine and fits as expected.
4.0,I am so bummed that this was not as long as pictured because it's a great coat! It just did not cover my butt/ legs enough and that is what I really needed.
4.0,Like how thin it is but it‚Äôs tight getting the credit cards out. Still like it
4.0,"I personally liked the bag.  It looks sweet famine young.  But you have to be careful not to overload it. I bought the bag for my mother.  She's a fan of the company.  I gave 4 stars because of the change in Kipling's bags production. They are smaller,  have less pockets and use cheaper material. So she was disappointed. But I like it and the delivery was amazingly fast,  nice service."
4.0,Purchased as an inexpensive everyday/play jacket for my 4 year old. She likes it and it does the job. I would purchase again if needed.
4.0,I loved the fit. It was comfortable and was able to last all day without getting fidgety. The fabric was light.
4.0,"LOVE THIS. Super pretty, nice material.<br />Returned because of one thing, I have a bit of a tummy and there is a seam going right through the center of the crotch to the waistline and it cuts into me in a very unflattering manner, I'd suggest buying a size or 2 up so it is looser if you have a bit of a tummy or large boobs."
4.0,"It seems that these are not that popular with a lot of reviewers, but I actually do like them. These are about the only masks that I can actually breathe in comfortably, thus I can wear them longer and the dont ruin my makeup. I had to hot glue the ventilator pieces on to the mask because they kept on popping off. Also there is a rubber piece between the ventilator so I doubt if you have to worry about anything coming in or going out.  I like that I can wash them too and they are as good as new."
4.0,"I bought this watch in August and its still keeping time perfectly! Its comfortable, holds up well, and for the price you cant go wrong! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the two pieces that hold the band down after you put it on move so the tail of the band does not stay secure. Definitely recommend if your looking for a reasonably priced watch with a second hand."
4.0,I like this suit it has a silicone rubber to keep it from riding up your butt. Soft material looks like it'll hold up I do a lot of kayaking. On a hot sunny day I couldn't get my bikini bottoms to dry out once I got out of the water. I wonder if it's because the fabric is thicker? Still like the product
4.0,Tiny bit tight at first. stretched out just fine.
4.0,Very comfortable!! The only thing I expected was the material to be cotton but it‚Äôs more like a spandex satiny material which is fine because it‚Äôs perfect when it‚Äôs hot! I am 5‚Äù4 weight 178 so I ordered large. I could have possibly gotten into a medium If I wanted it to be a little more figure fitted.
4.0,Nice lining but loose. Just make sure lining is inside hat before wearing.
4.0,Was a bit small for my mother's wrist. But I really liked that she could take it off with ease due to the claw feature.
4.0,"Super cute, but they run big so I would size down and the shipping took forever to get them"
4.0,"There is a lot to like about this wallet.  It is hand crafted and handsome.  It has 8 slots for cards, 2 clear id windows, and 3 multi use pockets.  I like my money separated into smaller and larger bills and this wallet gives me that option. It comes with the RFID protection which should be mandatory in all wallets.  All in all a nice wallet,  If you're like me it's a nice one to add to your collection."
4.0,The outfit is comforcomfortable. I ordered small. I am 5'2&quot; I weigh about 115lbs. I had to get the legs trimmed and hemmed. About 3.5 inches off. I could have done another inch if I wanted to wear it with flat shows. I wore smoothing undergarments because the material will show any and every wrinkle and dimple. The material is soft and feels good on the skin. It does not feel tight even though it gives a fitting look.
4.0,"Bought these to give to all my sisters and sisters-in-law. They feel cheap, but have lasted for a while now. In defense of the item, the design looks like it's not supposed to be a ""heavy duty"" looking necklace, and more of an elegant accessory. All in all, I am happy with the purchase and the girls love them!"
4.0,"Liked the shirt, but it is small order next size up, I ordered as suggested but had to return it. Don‚Äôt know if washes well or is durable, is not sheer. Otherwise a great color nice shirt."
4.0,"This was a gift for my daughter. 4 stars for the beauty of it, but really should get one star. One of the strands broke the first time she wore it. I have a one ( from a different vendor) same style and it has broken also.  All in all I will order another, I got many compliments when I wore it."
4.0,they were exactly what I needed
4.0,"That Knurled Crown just digs into the top of my wrist. They should have used a smooth Crown. Otherwise, a great watch. Painful though..."
4.0,Had to return it - it broke when trying to put it on ---
4.0,"As a mid sized lady, I think this is a super cute swimsuit and it fits pretty well.<br />The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the color description is way off! I ordered the color ‚ÄúCoral Pink‚Äù but as you can see, this is clearly a light baby pink! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />Overall, this is a great suit and would recommend"
4.0,"In spite of the fact that it is somewhat small, I love it.  Looks exactly as in the picture and doesn't look cheap.  It is a fix; have to drop about 5 lbs. and then it will be a perfect fit."
4.0,I usually wear xl but I bought the 1x based o√± the reviews and I regret it because the fit is too big. For the price It's a nice coat tho jus wish I had bought the XL
4.0,"This runs small. If you want a flowy romper, I'd definitely size up. I'm 5'9 and a size medium. This was barely long enough to fit my torso but the straps adjust so that helped. Very short and snug but cute."
4.0,"Quality seems good but haven‚Äôt had long enough to tell yet. Would‚Äôve given 5 stars but seems just a little short in length for torso....maybe just my body type though! Will wear and wash a couple times to see how the color and quality stand up!! Otherwise, I recommend."
4.0,"love it except for the sizing.. I thought it would be larger and my daughter would be able to wear this later.  I got the 24-28 mo and she is wearing 18mo now.  She wore it tonight and it won't last much longer.. Other than that it's cute and soft, and the zipper is easier than snaps."
4.0,they work great. well worth the money.
4.0,My hat fit fine and looks good.  A little squashed when it arrived.
4.0,"This is now my go to dress for days where I don‚Äôt want to wear pants but don‚Äôt want to feel like my butt is hanging out. I‚Äôm 180 pounds and 5‚Äô2‚Äù this goes passed my knees and the waist elastic cups my boobs really nicely. I expected the elastic to sit lower but big boobs (38D/ 36DD) will often shorten garments lol. It‚Äôs nice and lightweight but you don‚Äôt freeze if there is a breeze. My favorite part is definitely the hood, it covers the perfect amount of my forehead. Also, I like that this isn‚Äôt so lightweight so the dress doesn‚Äôt fly up and accidentally flash anyone."
4.0,"1st set came with a missing stone, but they sent out another pair right away and they are perfect!!"
4.0,"I needed a pair of red pants at the last minute and on a budget. I normally wear a L or XL depending on the manufacturer (I'm a size 12/14) but I took a risk and got the L. I'm surprised that these pants were as stretchy as they were without seeming super thin, and ultimately they were comfortable to wear the whole night. I only wish they had a variety of lengths; I'm 5'4"" and had to roll them up to get the ankle-length look I was going for."
4.0,"Not a true fit. If you have a booty and hips, don‚Äôt waste your time."
4.0,Number of pockets what I needed.
4.0,Very pretty dress. Only problem is the waist was too high. Otherwise I would have kept it.
4.0,I‚Äôve come to realize that I‚Äôm hard on my Apple Watch bands and have to change them quite frequently. I got this two pack because I needed a new black band and the iridescent one looks too cute to bypass. They are a little thinner than others that I‚Äôve had but they are sturdy and feminine looking so I‚Äôm pleased.
4.0,"Sleeves a little too long, but I like it and kept it. Nice thick material. No stretch."
4.0,"I just wish the front hip pocket was sewn to the inside, it tends to poke out and you have to keep tucking. (not a big deal though) The belt loops aren't secured enough. I accidentally tore two off while pulling them lightly to adjust through out the day. In retrospect, I'm the idiot, but still.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm always thrilled to wear them again and again! The side pocket on the right is great for your phone and easier to access than the front hip pockets."
4.0,"Nice to wear, slightly tight on wrist though; the clasp is clumsy to open/close compared to previous watches I've worn."
4.0,Fits small but otherwise nice.
4.0,Loved it! All my cards and knicknacks could fit into it anf the workmanship is wonderful.
4.0,"This is a little out of my normal comfort zone, I don't normally wear dresses.  It fits great, and people tell me it looks very nice on me. I like the material, and the style of the dress. I would recommend it."
4.0,Like most modal products they are vary comfortable but I din't like the second pouch system. After you urinate there is a lot of material to pull back down below the testicles. Pretty much have to drop your pants..
4.0,Better than I expected. Small pendant with nice chain. Worth the price. Nice piece.
4.0,"Nice belt. But, the buckle is heavier than I like."
4.0,"the black one is beautiful. but the purple one is more black than clear, which is not what I expected. other than that it‚Äôs a nice element to my outfits."
4.0,"I like these ALOT - a little too long - but I am short 5'1/2&#34;.  Compared to Lula? the lulas are long too but tapered better at the ankles so the extra length does not sag - hoping that they will shrink at least a little upon washing (not likely) I also prefer the lula waistband - the fabric is very close, maybe a touch thinner. All that said - these are a great value and I like that it is no nonsense shopping - not a fan of the FB shopping experience. I have already ordered a second pair. Will update if any quality issues after wearing and washing."
4.0,Order up in size due to others reviews.
4.0,It was too snug on my 7 year olds face
4.0,Perfect fit! Glass color is starting to chip
4.0,"Having to wear long sleeves in the summer can be annoying, but shirts like this makes the warmer months a bit more bearable.  The shirt is light and breezy.  If you are able to roll up your sleeves, there are buttons half way up each arm in the event of a day that may start out cool and gets a bit warmer as you go along.  My one small complaint is that the shirt is a bit darker than the picture.  I thought I was getting a nice bright yellow shirt for summer, but this is actually a bit darker, so more of a later summer type of color."
4.0,"They are super cute, however, we did end up returning for another style. The cute flowers just looked to much like big bug eyes once my daughter was awake looking around lol. (Daughter is 2 months old in pic for reference)"
4.0,Looks good but material is not impressive
4.0,Returned cause color was different then shown. Much darker.
4.0,"I have not had the opportunity to use the tool kit yet.  It would have been VERY helpful if some form of instructions had been included.  Some are pretty self evident; however, a brief explanation of what each tool is used for would be nice."
4.0,A little bit too long for me.
4.0,"I personally think over the shoulder bags should fall somewhere around your waist, but this one goes all the way down to my hip/femur area, which I think looks a bit silly. You could probably poke additional holes to make it shorter, but you'll end up with too much extra fabric on the strap. It's also just a bit large for a purse, but too small to be used as anything else. Not my favorite one, but others might say otherwise!"
4.0,"Purchased this for my MOH, fit great! Length will need to be altered but fit as expected based on the sizing charts."
4.0,Breast size too small
4.0,"The hat is nice looking, but it is too shallow and doesn‚Äôt sit on your head."
4.0,This will work just fine with my costume. The quality looks good from a few feet away but not close - it doesn't really matter to me because it is for one time only. Well worth the price paid.
4.0,"The dress itself is adorable, the color is just way too much for me"
4.0,This is late but I bought the ears for her Halloween costume and they were just ok. The quality was on point and it looked really cute on my niece. I will say that I wished the ears were more sturdy. We had to constantly adjust the ears to keep them up.
4.0,"Very cute, but a little clingy in the midsection."
4.0,"Good fix, but bottom ban is a tight fit for my regular size. Ordered a 40C, will order a 42C."
4.0,"Finally received the necklace. Ordered November 11th and received on December 28th. It‚Äôs not as nice as the photo perceives it to be, although it‚Äôs alright and still nice to have. The photo is slightly pixilated and fuzzy and the metal is low quality. Makes sense given the price. Still not horrible."
4.0,"I ordered it too large, XL.  One can see it is very roomy from viewing the picture.  It also is very stretchy.  Love the design."
4.0,"Oh my goodness these are adorable! I ordered the pink box pattern ‚Äì which is actually a raccoon if you look at the photos. These pants look exactly how they are pictured. The color is vibrant and the raccoon images are really well printed, very crisp and clean. The pant material is much better than I expected for this price. They are very soft, and have a good thickness to them. I like The fabric is some percentage of cotton. These are breathable, yet they still have some thickness to them. They are not so thin that you can see through them. The elastic band is really nice ‚Äì it is about an inch thick, and I like a thick waistband on my daughters pants because she crawls a lot so her pants tend to fall down. The bottom also has about a 2 to 3 inch ankle section.<br /><br />These do run humongous! My daughter is seven months old, and she wears a 12 month at Carter's on the waste, but we have to order or by 18 month because she's so tall. I expected bees to be a little bit bigger than Carter's after reading all the reviews but they are much larger than I expected. The sizing says 0 to 1 year, however when I open these up in the mail they lined up with my sons 2t pants. They did shrink a little bit in the wash, but even after washing them they are still about the size of leggings that are 18 month at Carter's."
4.0,"So Far......So Good  I like having various colors but so far have only won the blue one,  It fits well, does not get caught on clothing, and is fun to wear."
4.0,"Cute style, but really wanted something more of a bra type top.  No support.  But a nice swimsuit."
4.0,"My husband is a non-sadal wearer and he wore these comfortably. However, they failed to make an avid sandal wearer out of him."
4.0,Granddaughter real happy
4.0,"Winter is coming, and in cold weather, it is a major problem for kid to have no warm hats for outdoor activities. Parents have a variety of choices, how to choose the right hat? The best option is to keep your kid warm. This cute and warm animal knit hat is a good recommendation."
4.0,I paid $8.88 for this purse so my review is heavily influenced by what to expect for your money.<br /><br />The Name/Description of this purse is misleading. I would describe it as a midsize crossbody purse that is casual in style. If you are looking for a Business or Classic style this purse in my opinion does not fulfill that need and I wouldn't wear it w/ &#34;Power&#34; business attire.<br /><br />It's also NOT A TOTE. It has 1 handle **ik wtf** which would make it awkward in my opinion to carry w/o a strap. The strap it comes w/ is super long and has loops & holes like a belt. The feet & gold detailing add a little more structure than some crossbody purses but otherwise it's design is classic and will pair nicely w/ jeans for example.<br /><br />For less than $9 its construction is great! I would definitely recommend. It's can be a purchase for women of all ages.
4.0,Very comfortable shirt.  Got lots of compliments on it
4.0,Beautiful ! Fit great! My only issue is the backing. The screw lines are easily missed and if misaligned you‚Äôre going to have a reeeaaalllyyy tough time getting the backing off so be careful!!!
4.0,Very comfortable. Quality is great. The only thing i would say is don't wear with thin or tight pants because you could see the indentations where the lace at the legs are squeezing the tights.
4.0,Don‚Äôt like the strings coming off mesh when I wash
4.0,The chain is horribly cheap and turned my skin green with in 1 hour. The pendant is gorgeous. Well worth the money just replace the chain
4.0,This dress wrinkles very easily. It was also somewhat short...I am 5‚Äô6 and got a medium and wish I‚Äôd gotten a large. I‚Äôll most likely have to wear with leggings or tights. I absolutely love the color though and the material is very comfy.
4.0,"I like them. They feel good, they fit well, and they have a versatile style that can transition from inside at work to out at the beach."
4.0,"Sweater size is somewhat small.. like it's color, it does shed.  Sweater is warm."
4.0,"Great buy, really well-made hat for the price. It's not too thick, but not too thin, it's perfect for cold nights (like 40 degrees) and fits well. I ordered the light gray color, but the hat I received though looks like their dark gray option, rather than a light heather gray. I love the hat so I'm keeping it even though the color isn't exactly what I expected, so less one star."
4.0,"Comfy and cute, this is a medium. Runs big!"
4.0,Great for the price that being said I'm large chested 40D fit a bit snug
4.0,Quality of dress is great...it was slightly small but will work..coral exactly represented
4.0,"I took these to Alaska where temps went down to -36¬∞F....and these failed quite a bit. For anything below zero degree, use mittens as fingers together stay warmer and you can use hand warmers in them to warm your fingers.<br />Other than that, they're a bit on the small size for their stated size but they are well built."
4.0,Not very stilish
4.0,Looks very nice. It's a little bit too long
4.0,"Great product, color was a little darker than expected, with a very glossy sheen, and very well made."
4.0,Look and price beats spending triple the cost for a new umbrella1
4.0,"This cap is actually quite nice. I found it sketchy at first, but it came in very nice. I wasn‚Äôt completely sure how well a ‚Äúleather‚Äù cap would look, but I decided to give it a run for my money. I‚Äôm still in great awe over this cap every time I wear it. It‚Äôs sturdy, it‚Äôs amazing looking, it fits well, so what‚Äôs there not to like? Firstly, the metal Arrow symbol on the front was slightly crooked and offcentered. No biggie for me. I do slightly have OCD over things sometimes, but this doesn‚Äôt bother me because I don‚Äôt see it while it‚Äôs on the top of my head. Lastly, the SnapBack part on the back is made of a relatively cheap feeling plastic. That‚Äôs all the complaints I have for this cap. One thing to note about this cap is that since the symbol is metal, it does have a little weight to it. I don‚Äôt notice the weight, but it‚Äôs just something to think about. All in all I think it‚Äôs wonderful."
4.0,The bracelet is way too large for my arm.  It is pretty and I like the concept of being able to carry my keys and drivers license while I am walking.
4.0,My husband's head is big it fits but wish he had a little more room. Nice hat
4.0,These are cute and I'm looking forward to wearing them.
4.0,"I used this for my kids school bookfair. Only issue I had was it was big for my height of 5'3"" even though I got a child's size, but it still worked out and the kids had a blast with it."
4.0,My daughter wanted vampire teeth for her birthday and she loved these!  There were enough for her to share and with 12 of them they were easy to depose of after use and grab another.
4.0,supercute for my daugfhters upcoming dance class
4.0,Boyfriend loved it and it fit well :) would definitely buy again!
4.0,"Esta bonito, es igual a la fotograf√≠a"
4.0,"These are comfortable slippers with a decent arch support. Don't know how long that will last but they feel good right now. I am glad I bought a smaller size, as the description recommended. These slippers run large."
4.0,Very nice watch for the money. I have a gold Rolex like this but don't like to travel with it. This is close in weight and appearance .
4.0,This dress comes in two different styles - the skater dress (this one) and the bodi-con dress (pencil skirt style) in the same colors. The material is thick and bathing suit type material. The straps are very stretchy and tight across the back - a little uncomfortable. The bodi-con dress was lined in the blue floral pattern so I assumed this one would be too but it is not. You need pasties! This dress was a little long on me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù) and the right side bunched a bit under the arm. I‚Äôm returning but I do think it‚Äôs a pretty dress and def worth the money. It just isn‚Äôt for me
4.0,Purchased these for my husband for Christmas so he has not received them yet but upon inspecting them and comparing to his other shoes they do appear to run a bit small.
4.0,"I'm a size 18-20 and I got the 5XL and it fit just fine. The top has underwires and it's a bit uncomfortable, it rides up  a lot. I'm a DD so I don't know if I'm too big or too small there. Overall I like the suit!"
4.0,I simply love ties.
4.0,"Love the color of this dress! Fit was pretty good. I'm 5'8&#34; 136 lbs ordered a medium. Would have liked it to be a little more fitted, but material doesn't stretch so it's good."
4.0,They are very attractive and were as described by the seller.
4.0,as I expected it - cute and easy dress
4.0,I love this sweatshirt but I ordered it in size large and received a size small. I barely fit it.
4.0,Very nice material. Cool to wear in the heat. Runs very big.
4.0,They are bigger than size requested. Size down 1
4.0,My husband is usually an L so we got an XL and it was just slightly too tight. If you like a looser fit size up maybe two sizes. It might just have to do with body type though. My hubby is Tall and bulky muscular.<br />Material is great though and it looked good in pictures. It was just a little tighter than a sweater should be I think
4.0,"This bag is adorable, mine didn‚Äôt smell bad at all, I just wish it was a tad bit bigger but besides that I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase"
4.0,"I love my hat ...!!!! I looked like a million dollars woman, everybody loved the hat at church. It was my first time wear this style of hat, even though I'm not a hat person, I was sold; so I'm looking forward to buy some more."
4.0,for my son
4.0,Fits a bit big but I always have that problem so overall as I expected.
4.0,I am really happy with them but I do want them to remain this way for a very long time
4.0,"The socks are warm & fuzzy, but really meant for teens or older children. They're a bit tight on my ankles, and while I don't have fat ankles, I do have arthritis ausing my left ankle to retain a bit of fluid if I dont wear a looser sock. I would not buy these again."
4.0,"Purchased for my High-school kid. He loves it. Very comfortable,  great value. Good stitching, true to size.<br /><br />Ordered a medium.  Child size: 5'5 inches, 128 lbs."
4.0,"This infinity scarf is made of 30% cotton and 70% polyester and it is 63 by 19 inches. Although it is very light weight, it is not extremely sheer and could get a little warm, I would say this would be a great transitional scarf for those days when it is cold in the morning and warmer in the day. The plaid print is very pretty and the colors are bright. My favorite feature of this scar is that it does not get wrinkles, so you can travel easily with no worries about an iron. Overall, this is a great item and I am very happy with my purchase. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of this product."
4.0,This necklace comes in a very sparkly heart box and is displayed very well inside. It's the perfect gift for any music lover out there!
4.0,"Cute! Thin material though. Bought a large, for reference I'm 5'5 and a size 6 in banana republic dresses"
4.0,"I ordered 34D and the bra fit, but the panties were too small. The garter belt was also slightly small but I can make it work. The bra is nice quality and looks and feels nice."
4.0,"Ther are great for the price very comfortable and durables buy again,"
4.0,"Fits perfect just a little small in the waist, would definitely get again!"
4.0,"Super warm and cute wool socks. Great for snow and super cold days.  For my toddler, I got the 2t size, and FYI, there‚Äôs no non-slip on the sole."
4.0,Box came damaged but shades were perfect.
4.0,I like this bobysuit it's sexy and cute the material is a little on the thin side but other than that I'm happy with it<br />Will update wit pics<br />Update..the gold ring on the front are not sewn on or put together well they started to fall off so imma try to super glue them down and hopefully that will work bcuz the bodysuit is still cute
4.0,"Good things do come in small packages and these glasses prove that to be true. Be aware, though, the lens is really small and may require head adjustments as you read down a page.  The case is wonderful as it protects the glasses whether they're sitting on a table, in your pocket, or in a purse.  I bought these to replace a favorite pair I thought I had lost (since found) and which I had had for several years. The ones I lost came in a similar case, but were about twice the size.  I like these as well and the smaller size looks cute perched on the end of my nose and has the advantage of fitting into my purses better."
4.0,"Soft felt hat, two tone, very sporty looking. Not a true ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù hat, but similar style.<br /><br />There‚Äôs just enough of a rim to keep the sun off of your neck.<br /><br />It‚Äôs very lightweight, just the perfect size."
4.0,"A bit shorter than expected, but very cute-- shows off my lumps!"
4.0,"So far, I love this Apple Watch band. I bought the silver crystal one, and it matches perfect with my silver 44mm Apple Watch. It is exactly what I anticipated, and the delivery was very fast. Unfortunately, the first couple times you wear it, the band can be cumbersome to un-latch. However, now that it's been a couple weeks, it now comes off easily but remains secure when wearing. I have gotten a ton of compliments on it, and will definitely purchase another when and if this one starts to wear!"
4.0,product is great for kids walking. little large. comes out leg some times
4.0,"Nice, crisp fabric, taffeta like without the sheen. Stretch lace overlay on top. Even fit over muscular arms with no difficulty. Lining in upper portion so he's doesn't show through. Awkward to put on by yourself as zipper is in the back, but not up to the neckline. The zipper is similar to having it in the sideseam. No need for a slip."
4.0,Material is a little bit thick but it‚Äôs super comfortable and fits perfect . I like the soft material and would consider purchasing again .
4.0,"The color and material of the dress are both nice! I wore it to a friend's wedding at a winery; it was a hit.<br /><br />However, I had to have it hemmed about 2 inches before I could wear it (like in the picture). I am about 5'3"", 130-135 lbs,  34 D, with very short legs. The dress bunched up a little bit, but it was pretty minor.<br /><br />I normally never wear anything off the shoulder like this, but I felt super comfortable and pretty in this dress. I think it's a good purchase for the price."
4.0,Not as long as pic.. but very comfortable
4.0,Not bad.  I like it
4.0,Cute lounging  dress for at home or to use as a cover up. It's  very bug so i would suggest  getting  up to 2 sizes smaller than norm.
4.0,"Its a very cute dress, I got so many compliments! I just wish it was a bit more fitted around the waist it was a little big and I bought a small."
4.0,I do really like this outfit the shirt was a bit faded the cross itself isn't as dark as I would have liked it but personally for the price I think it's great. my munchkin looks awesome and she feels beautiful you can tell how she's prancing around the house lol would recommend it and I would definitely buy this again
4.0,The size was off a little
4.0,My daughter loves them. They not cheaply made . I happy with the purchase. I'm pressed with quality of the product considering the low price.
4.0,My husband has been asking for heated motorcycle gloves and was thrilled with these. They fit perfect and heat up quickly.
4.0,"nice vest. I usually wear medium, but purchased a large because of what I read in some other reviews. The fit on the chest is a trifle snug but doable. For my particular body, I would have gone one more  size up. Another problem is that it took so long to get to me, almost 2 1/2 weeks. Guess I have been spoiled by Prime delivery."
4.0,"I liked that it worked well.  I took my kids to NASCAR, and the headphones did work. they are very tight, would not work for adult."
4.0,Cute bag for my 16yr old.
4.0,"Basic, good size for casual work or whatever else. Not too big, not too small, not too fake-gold looking."
4.0,"Looks great, really cute. Only problem is it's a little tight. I wear a 7 1/4 inch bracelet. Wish it was a bit larger, I would buy more."
4.0,As you can tell from the picture the necklace is very small but attractive and a great gift
4.0,"I just love that these came sorted in plastic bags of the separate colors. I know that sounds silly but I purchased these for the purpose of using them with small children and it helped immensely not having to separate them as I only use like colors at a time.<br /><br />I have purchased similar packs of 4 of these at the Dollar Store before and they were held to the finger with a sewn elastic piece. These have a coordinating colored 1/4&#34; or so wide rubber band to slip on your finger during use, which I love! The only downside to this is that the rubber bands are way too large for tiny fingers. These are sized for normal adult fingers and any smaller than that, they are not recommended for.<br /><br />Overall I would purchase these again because it is a huge value for the price. The only downside is the size of the rubber bands."
4.0,Initial review after a few miles in them is these are a good budget option. The material is not as soft or durable as a injinii but they are good for workouts and short walks/runs. Material is a little thin. Glad I purchased these!
4.0,They are very cute and are great under close toed summer shoes.  Very worth the purchase!
4.0,kinda matched the the two tone bracelet/necklace set i plan on  purchasing
4.0,"If you have ever been curious about what you would look like with stud earrings, these are perfect for a test run. They magnet backings are small and can be lost easily, but if you are careful these are perfect to see if you would like to get your ears pierced."
4.0,Bought as a gift and they were a hit. Soft and comfortable is the report back.
4.0,Perfect for weather in the 0-20 degree range.  Has a good grip on the palm.  Wish the grip extended to fingers of the palm too.
4.0,The beads are larger than expected giving it a more masculine appearance. But my friend that I gave it to absolutely loved it.
4.0,"My 9 year old son is a wrestler and I thought these looked bright, colorful and sassy for him to wear during his matches; however, I did not notice a few swear words on the socks.  He didn't think it would be appropriate to wear them to tournaments.  They are now for lounging at home.  He says they are comfortable and he really likes them.  I should have scrolled over the image, but never really thought about the wording."
4.0,These are terrific for visibility but the plastic nose piece cuts into the left side of my nose and is painful. I am going to try and put a piece of foam tape as I really do like the fit otherwise
4.0,"It‚Äôs alright. Let‚Äôs see how long it holds up, though. It‚Äôs pretty big but that‚Äôs how I wanted it so I have no complaints there"
4.0,"I got this dress to wear it to an event I had. Wanted a dress that it wasn't too sexy. The dress fit true to it's size. I ordered an xlarge. The fabric is soft but you can see through it whith the light on. So i put under some black spanks and it was all good. Very comfortable, the only problem I had was every time I was walking the skirt would go up and I had to keep pulling it down. At some point i got frustrated about it. Overall, the dress is cute and the batwing is adorable.<br /><br />** I received this product free/discount for my honest review."
4.0,"Love it , fit like a glove"
4.0,"A bit big and heavy, but I'm keeping."
4.0,"I had a Gownie for my other two childrens and I loved it! Decided to get a new color/design for my last. Just received it, I am 265 and about 5'5 and I ordered an XXL. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant and it is a little tighter than I hoped. A little nervous I won't be able to wear it when full term but hoping to be able to because it is super cute. I love these!"
4.0,"Compared to the traditional paper covid masks this was a godsend, BUT I have a really small head and struggled a little, not a lot, but a little keeping mine on the WHOLE day, as in it only fell down a couple times through the day, but I had my hair in a pony tail and had the mask go over my ponytail to give some extra surface area for extra tension to keep it in place. My husband has moderate sized head, on the larger side, and it fit him perfectly snug."
4.0,It's very attractive and surprisingly supportive for a non-underwire bra. I'm a 38DD and it's next to impossible to find a good fit. I do worries about the plastic hooks and if they'll break down sooner than the metal ones.
4.0,"I bought this so I would have something cool to wear while I was putting on my makeup.  It is actually very nice.  I have thyroid problems, so last year, I went down to  6/8, but I lost mostly muscle.  This year I gained weight, and now am a 12/14, and a roly poly looking 12/14 at that.  I wanted this to be loose, so I sized up to a 1x.  Well, it is loose, but I believe if I wanted it a little tighter, the Large would be fine.  It drapes really well, and the gathers at the top are just enough to cover my stomach, yet still not look like a tent.  It is not 100% cotton, but rather a blend, but still feels pretty cottony.  It did not pill, shrink, or get scratchy when I washed it.  The color is very attractive and should complement most skin tones.  Really, I was surprised at how well this is made and recommend it."
4.0,Nice hat. Not the color I was expecting.
4.0,Nice frame!
4.0,The texture and color are what stand out on the bag.
4.0,"I originally ordered the medium and while it fit well throughout my body, it was extremely short!  I ended up ordering the large and it was maybe an inch or so longer, but enough to make me feel a bit better about the length."
4.0,I am 5'4&#34; 155 lbs and ordered the XXL Based on the reviews. It fit me well but was almost too short in the torso. Helped make me a fun Tomatoa for Halloween though so I give it 4 stars
4.0,works as intended excellent feel to them.
4.0,"I'm 5'10 and wear a 16 usually and the XXL just wouldn't fit as I'd hoped.  Perhaps it's because I'm tall so the torso was too short, but it didn't stretch well enough either.  Overall it seems good quality made just didn't fit right."
4.0,"I love these earrings but I hate fish hooks. I purchased lever backs from a jewelry supplier and I changed the fish hooks to leverbacks. But for the fish hooks, I would definitely give these five stars."
4.0,Shorter than I hoped and is smooth like a swimsuit
4.0,the pendant has a pretty reasonable price and is really solid. it is also masculine. only problem is pendant tends to flip around when you wear it but that is fixable
4.0,Use for outside.
4.0,"Comfortable, wide width slipper.  For those with a wide foot...These are your slippers"
4.0,I underestimated the size. Only fits around my forearm
4.0,It's just like it looks like. Came perfectly packaged. It's a bit tight for me but that's my fault. Thank you.
4.0,I get compliments every time I wear this dress!!! The material is pretty thin/cheap/sheer but that‚Äôs honestly what I expected from this imported amazon dress. I wear nude shape wear with it and so far haven‚Äôt noticed any indecent see-through. It did shrink in the dryer.
4.0,Using it on a kilt belt for a black Irish kilt (Keltic Thunder style).
4.0,"The material lighter than expected but ok did not like how big the neck opening was, as I  sew well I can fix it. I am a size 12<br /> large busted and the medium was fine.<br />I ordered 2 in different colors and like the colors."
4.0,I like the fit of the shorts and they are light.  Bought 3 pairs of
4.0,"I like owls, and this pendant and the chain are beautiful.  I gave it only 4 stars because some of the attachments on the back were loose, and it is quite heavy around my neck.  Otherwise it is exactly what I hoped it would be."
4.0,"I was skeptical about these. I'm 7 weeks postpartum and probably close to a size 14 right now. Barely any of my pre-baby clothes fit and I've been really frustrated by my belly. These leggings do a great job of holding it in, at least. The only bad thing I can say about them is that they're VERY warm. It needs to be cold outside for me to feel comfortable in them temperature-wise. (I have the lined ones.) But they are awesome and an awesome value for the price."
4.0,This is a Christmas present and has really not been evaluated in use. I will update after Christmas.
4.0,I thought this was all one piece but it is really a more like a shawl . With pearls on it along the top that get caught in my hair. The pearls are pretty and if I had really short hair it would be great. It‚Äôs extremely long so for someone who is short it‚Äôs not that practical because I‚Äôm stepping on it all the time like I said I thought it was an actual sweater with fringe.  It is  very long in the front and not on the sides very different than the picture
4.0,Very comfortable. Crotch area was a little too snug. Wear these as under wear for my snow boarding trips
4.0,"I bought this hat to wear to a friend's &#34;garden party&#34; themed bridal shower. I wanted something that would be fun for that occasion, but that I could also use as a sun hat at the beach and park the rest of the summer. This hat fits the bill perfectly. It's comfortable and flexible, and though it arrived a bit misshapen, it was easy to mold back into shape. Which makes me think it'll hold up quite nicely tossed into a beach bag this summer. The brim can be folded up or down for different looks, and it came with an optional chin strap, which will be useful if I decide to wear it on a windy day or out on the water."
4.0,not all green tint more like blueish green tint but still work
4.0,"The pros are the pockets, the polka dots, and the length. I'm 5 feet with shoes on and it's so hard to find a maxi that I'm not tripping on. It's the perfect length, and I love the loose fit.<br /><br />The con is that it's pretty see through. If I were going to the shore, this is perfect. But I couldn't wear it to work or out without a slip and tank and that wasn't Part of my plan when I bought this."
4.0,"worked for a day trip in the snow, but somehow my feet were wet at the toes! probably sweat though!"
4.0,"Gave this to my wife for Christmas.  She really liked it.  Nice color, good quality.  They only thing I would say that is a negative at all (and some people might not consider this a negative) is that the clasp is the more traditional &#34;metal tongue through a hole&#34; design instead of the nicer band designs that use the new claps design that Apple came up with.  Again, this isn't really a negative per se because it shows it in the picture. But just thought I'd mention it in this review because my wife says she likes the other clasp design better."
4.0,"Like the print, color & velcro closure."
4.0,Cool pair of shades for the price. I needed something simple for my vacation and these shades works well.
4.0,But my son loves it
4.0,"Well made quality dress.  It fits well and while Indo like it, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the material it‚Äôs made of, feels very polyester-y!"
4.0,Perfect for work and casual events
4.0,"Nice....ties in the back, so that is a little awkward, otherwise. very attractive piece."
4.0,This is a very cute dress...if you are not short-waisted. the material is like a stretchy stiff cotton. Great for everyday but not for night.
4.0,"Really comfy, and surprisingly flattering. (I never wear crop tops because of my size) Does smell a bit like vinegar and the flag on the sleeve is just ironed on but it still is cute."
4.0,I was happy with this shirt. It fit correctly and will be cute with leggings. 3/4 sleeves.
4.0,I wish this came in a small. It's super soft and I really love it but it's a bit big. I ordered the medium and I'm 5'4 125lbs. It's a little bit too big. I never wear a small but in this the medium is too big.
4.0,"140 pounds, 5'6.5&#34;, 34B, fits well with a medium.  The bottom of the bodice is sort of strange fitting on me.  Length and bodice size are perfect.  I won't be altering this bridesmaid dress.  Definitely affordable!"
4.0,"Was a little big, but we fixed it. Super cute!"
4.0,This fabric is so soft and it fits very well. I am 5'8&#34; 200lbs and got L. The length is right on the knees and it doesn't ride up when in motion. Will definately recommend; may even purchase in another color.
4.0,It's great...
4.0,Got compliments wearing it i recommend buying it was a little small though
4.0,I have to roll the top of the pants over in order to make the pants fit me correctly and I had to have them hemmed.  They are extremely long but very nice looking.
4.0,Cute watch. Great price.
4.0,I love the fit-the only issue was that I ordered black and I got brown...still cute though
4.0,Like the fit. After I got a size smaller.
4.0,Great looking shirt - the logo is popp'n and the quality of cotton is nice..... A thicker knit.  I would say it runs a size small and shrinks so order up !
4.0,"They look like the picture and are good quality, the only thing is the legs aren‚Äôt as tapered as I was expecting. I think I‚Äôm going to take them in with my sewing machine some at the bottoms to make the legs and ankles skinnier so they are more like true boyfriend jeans. But other than that, they‚Äôre good"
4.0,This jacket fits well.  It does run VERY small.
4.0,Really love this dress. I want to live in it. Material is a little thin.
4.0,"After a couple of months, one of the velcro straps has split where you pull it up. The stitching has come undone. I will have to try to use an iron on product or resew this to stop it from splitting further. Otherwise, these wash well and have held up as far as sole and other fabric areas."
4.0,"Larger than expected, zipper can stick a bit. Otherwise nice."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband.  He actually picked them out.  They are very crisp and clear (I tried them too).  The only downfall is the British flag design on the side is much more noticeable in the person than in the picture.  In the picture, it appears to be engraved in/unnoticeable design (etched in if you will) but in person, it is much more noticeable.<br />Otherwise, these are a great price and as mentioned, very clear."
4.0,"Not as nice as the original embroidered Tesla hats from Tesla, but not bad for the price."
4.0,"Great pair of sunglasses considering the price. They definitely feel sturdier than my $150+ Ray Ban sunglasses of the same style. The lenses do scratch fairly easily, so I suggest keeping them in the provided case. In my opinion, the lenses are much more of a yellow/orange color rather than pink, otherwise just as described!"
4.0,"Used these for an event and they worked perfect. But for regular use, they are too big"
4.0,I love that it came with a slip to use under since the fabric is light.  It could do to be slight wider to be a little less snug around the bodice.  Especially since it is a lounging gown or house dress.  I have other house dresses that are the same size and fit a little more relaxed in the bodice.  Overall - I am happy with the gown and love the colors and feel.
4.0,"This is a great dress! It's made well, the fabric is not sheer or thin. That being said, it's not thick or uncomfortable either. The stripes match up, spot on at the seams (no mismatching stripes) and the stripes are wide as imaged. It does fit well, but is shorter than I expected - thus the 4 starts instead of 5. One other thing, is that the dress does not come with the belt as shown. But, any standard skinny belt will work!<br /><br />Like many of you, I rely on the reviews I read here on Amazon before I buy anything. One of the reasons I shop so much on Amazon (aside from the awesomeness of an Amazon Prime account with SUPER fast shipping!) is the amount of healthy customer feedback about the products sold. I like to do my part and give back to this amazing community by reviewing items I‚Äôve actually purchased and used myself. My reviews are always honest and accurate reflecting my experience. I hope you found my review helpful. If so, please give it a thumbs up!"
4.0,"I had been searching high and low for a watch like this. I bought it as a gift. The main concern is if this watch is tough enough to withstand daily use if never taken off. Only time will tell, so I can't give it five stars, yet. I bought this model because I couldn't find any other watch that was both analog and digital, was not too large, sleek looking, and made out of metal. Not easy to find, even while searching through expensive brands. So I'm happy I found this watch. The only thing I don't like is the orange back light. I like watches with blue, green, or white back lights. But that's personal preference and isn't a huge deal unless you look at the watch in the dark, often. Overall, it was just what I was looking for style and function-wise, and for a good price."
4.0,Fine for what it is. Not much compression though
4.0,"nothing wrong with it, works fine and well. think people were being too rough with the zippers because i‚Äôm having zero issues so far."
4.0,Good Quality would have to use it a lot more before giving a more an accurate review
4.0,Beautiful color and it‚Äôs fitted.. belt a little too small
4.0,really pretty but one broke the first time i wore them
4.0,I love the way fit and feel
4.0,"I bought the purple dress with black cats on it, and it is super cute in person. The fabric is nice, the design didn't have any fuzziness issues that others reported, and it appears to be a good value. The only issue is that, unlike what some others have said, it ran slightly big for me. Based on the size chart, I got the Small, but really could have used an XS (I'm 5'2"", 110lbs). But, since they don't make that size, I'm keeping it."
4.0,"Beautifull dress, good fabric"
4.0,"This bodysuit looked exactly like the picture. I love the pattern that I chose. The material isn‚Äôt my favorite, which is why I gave 4 stars, but I would still buy another one. It fits nicely."
4.0,"Fun gift for couples that walk in cold weather, love it!"
4.0,Very nice. Did not disappoint
4.0,"The quality for price seems reasonable, BUT be careful of the size scale...listen to their guideline...I wear a 34 jean, ordered a 36 belt, and it is barely fitting in to the last hole.  Probably my fault because maybe I should wear a 36 jean..haha...other than that, it looks good and feels good, not like a plastic rope...."
4.0,Nice watch but wish other bands were available. There are only a few 14mm bands available unlike the 18mm which has multiple bands you can buy.<br />The band issue is why I deducted a star
4.0,This is a wonderful watch. It's not too big which is great with my small wrist size. Then strap took a little figuring out. The bezel is great along with the screw-down crown. My only problem with this watch is the low power reserve. It winds down fairly quickly so I bought a watch winder. It's not an Omega and I'm not wearing it to fool people. I love this style of dive watch with a rubber strap and it is exactly what I was hoping for.
4.0,"Fits very small, wear a size large normally and had to get a 2x size"
4.0,"This is a lovely dress, fits well and looks good. The only downsides are that the neck is forever pulling to the back which makes me feel a little like the dress is trying to choke me and it is really hard to wear anything other than a strapless bra with it."
4.0,"These are fairly long earrings with thick silver and decent detailing. The eye of Horus is very detailed but the lotus could use a bit more definition. Overall, good earrings for any fan of Ancient Egypt."
4.0,"The shirt is really soft. But it is much smaller than I expected. If you're buying, I would recommend getting at least two sizes larger if not three. I didn't know it was a crop top either. I bought a large and it fits like a small. but it's still super cute and comfy!"
4.0,I love the color and the quality is good so far
4.0,I love them their so cute! I love the fact that it changes color
4.0,Its a nice watch so far hope it dont break in a couple of weeks
4.0,Socks are on the thin side but they will do the job.
4.0,"Good case. Pretty room inside, could easily be used as a dump pouch, etc. My zipper did malfunction - the clasp came apart from the zipping mechanism. The zipper itself works well and I was able to replace the zipper pull with a small keychain, so it wasn't a huge deal."
4.0,Quality of silver excellent and the size is terrific.
4.0,its absolutely beautiful but fits small
4.0,"It's a little tight around the chest but other than that, it's very well-made. I don't recommend it if you're going to be laying out in the sun though, as it was kind of hot.  For swimming, it's great if you want some tummy coverage/control."
4.0,"It came missing a small link just near the large center piece. BUT ...was easily fixed. Beautiful color, nice weight, easy to wear."
4.0,"This is a great charm, it feels substantial in weight. I was looking for something to hang down from my rear view mirror, I had a similar star that broke. The crystal is very pretty and reflects the light well. My only complaint is, since it is the AB crystal, the iridescent coating is on the back of the star, so if it flips around, it doesn't look as good. I used to have a star where the coating was clear, so this was kind of a disappointment. I would also warn anyone, since this is my third star of this material, that one drop, and you're done, so be very careful with these. Overall, I would recommend this :)"
4.0,"Excellent product, very comfy and very well made. Love all of them."
4.0,"Liked the design very much but was quite disappointed by the VERY tight fit. All of my clothes labeled large fit fine, but this seems made for a slim Asian body. I‚Äôll have to wear it unzipped since if I exchange for XL it may be too wide in shoulders. Quality pretty good but some stitching missing on brand label. Instructions for care on the attached tag are only in Chinese (but there is a separate paper tag in the shipping bag in English)."
4.0,"Used them for 2 months almost every single day, and they worked amazing! But the other day I went to open the case and they were sadly broken. For $20 they had a great lifespan and were definitely better than a $300 pair of prescription sunglasses."
4.0,"Very nice<br />, good fit!'"
4.0,I feel the sick would be much more comfortable if the fabric was thinner.
4.0,"It's beautiful and beautifully made with the lovely stiching I found in other Karin sweaters, but this is not a roomy, fisherman's, or Irish sweater.  It is snug."
4.0,"a cute skirt to add to collection, bright colorful prints goes well with other attires I already have in closet, fit was as expected, fabric is not too thin, but might need a slip"
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, but shorter than I expected.  Will only be wearing around the house because of that."
4.0,Very thin sole and they are REALLY high so I wouldnt recommend for a short person - I am 5'6&#34; and they are about three inches above me kneww
4.0,Very good like it
4.0,"Purchased two dress shirts, one in red and one in powder blue. The one in red fit a little small, and one of the button holes wasn't formed correctly. Otherwise, this is a great dress shirt for an affordable price!"
4.0,"Fiits Great, looks good"
4.0,"Exactly how stated. Material is super stretchy and is a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô. Also super soft in material. No problems with the order, giving it a 4 because I wish it was more of a ‚Äúpoofy‚Äù tutu shirt. I ended up adding tutu material underneath"
4.0,"I normally can fit a small in all clothing, am pregnant at this time so I ordered a large thinking it would be extra roomy. It's not, it fits perfect though, not complaining. Just keep that in mind, I am 5'3&#34; and normally weigh 105lbs. I don't know why people are complaining about it being made cheap, it's not wool, but has a nice feel, and beautiful color. I have gotten lots of compliments on it. It's just a nice jacket, it's not real thick, it's a great product at a good price."
4.0,I ordered the leggings and the shirts expecting them to match.  The red and the grey dye lot does not match the leggings even though it is no clear on the online picture.  This was a disappointment.  The shirts are still a great quality and fit and wash well.
4.0,"Good undies, but they were bigger than the other, all black, set I purchases previously in a smaller size.. Not sure what is going on in their sizing department. It's not bad enough for me to return them. They are nice cotton, the colors are pretty."
4.0,"It's very pretty! And like other reviewers, I agree that a full zipper would be preferable. Hopefully, it holds up! Can't beat the price for a cute bag!"
4.0,It looks good and really enjoying it...
4.0,The look and feel great! They are a little delicate so you may have to wash in delicate cycle to keep them in tact
4.0,Absolutly love it
4.0,"I read the reviews on this dress before I ordered and took a chance on it.  I went with the instructions to &#34;order a size larger than you normally wear&#34; and ordered an XL (I usually wear a size 8 or 10).  It happily arrived way earlier than scheduled and it fit perfectly, though the comments are correct about the dress not being a flowy as shown in the picture.  I hand washed it in cold water and allowed it to air dry...and it shrunk!  However, I  sprayed it liberally with water and ironed it and it magically returned to the original size.  I am very pleased with it--it is a darling dress!"
4.0,Nice dress. It was a little complicated to put on.
4.0,On time and quality as promised
4.0,"I LUV THESE SUNGLASSES.<br />NO CASES. Keep all of yours always!<br />I RECOMMEND FOR ‚ÄúTHE LOOKS,‚Äù THE VALUE, STYLES, LENS COLORS VARY. VER NICE.<br />NOE TO HAVE OPTIONS ~ NOT JUST SAME SUNGLASSES W/NO OPTIONS AT ALL."
4.0,"Nice quality, I should have checked the sizing chart before ordering instead of after then I would have ordered the correct size."
4.0,COLOR BLEEDS!! Got so many compliments on this dress. Washed it 2x and the second time the red shirt color bloched randomly all over the white stripes. Very upsetting.
4.0,"En mi modesta opini√≥n la correa es muy fina para ser usada c√≥modamente, es muy fina, solo 2cm de ancho :(."
4.0,"Little thin for my taste (you can feel the separate threads if you stretch them over  your hand), but they fit well and do not slide."
4.0,Very comfortable dress for hot weather. Ordered a large so it would be loose and breezy. Color is advertised as red but is really a wine color. Rayon fabric is very soft!
4.0,"This pin works for almost anything. My jacket, backpack, messenger bag or hoodie. The clasp is a bit loose but fine once replaced with a different backing. The color and image is bright and overall adorable."
4.0,"I ordered these boots to replace a pair that I had previously owned that were ALMOST identical to these. These boots have a zipper on the inside foot/ankle/calf that only unzips about halfway up the boot from the sole, instead of going all the way up the boot; which I feel is the only downside to them. They are SUPER CUTE and go with just about anything, from jeans to dresses to shorts... For the price, I feel they are well made, and are definitely worth buying if you are even slightly considering purchasing them. Probably not best for regular wear in snow or rainy weather, unless you can manage to properly waterproof them, but that's just my personal opinion. The zipper on the outside of the boot is not functional at all, but as long as you order a half size to a full size up from your normal size (especially if you're wearing socks with any thickness to them), then getting them on & off with ease shouldn't be an issue"
4.0,Es algo grande en comparaci√≥n con mis otros charms
4.0,This is a beautiful and bright tee shirt. The fit was a little small but workable.
4.0,"I bought these for a friend for Christmas. They are very cute, go with several outfits, and hang well in ears.  They tend to turn and get stuck every now and then due to their slight weight, but nothing to give a bad rating for!"
4.0,These are so cute. I have them as gifts at Christmas with a nice chapstick and everyone loved them.
4.0,"Got my Dress yesterday,it looks great!Its just a little longer then expected.The quality looks ok so far,but I guess I will be to tell if it got washed a couple times."
4.0,"The short is lovely, I have it to my husband for a birthday gift. He got many compliments, but found it too not be a regular fit, but a fitted shirt. It should be listed as such."
4.0,I love it! So attractive and spacious
4.0,"I like the fabric,  very lightweight"
4.0,"If you know how to take it in, you will be fine. But it's very cute and very lite. The shoulder doesn't sit as low as I would like."
4.0,"I received 2 packs with three in each pack instead of 5 per pack. I still love the product though! Even only getting 3 for the price of 5 still seems like a pretty good deal, lol"
4.0,", I bought a size L and I am normally and 8/ 10.  5. 4&#34;, 145 lbs and 36 c bra size.  I like a bit loose and not tight and th4s is purrfect!"
4.0,Loved it absolutely looks gorgeous and expensive. The only thing i did not like is the fact that it shed a little . i went out on a date and i kept getting fibers on the table and in my food but apart from that it was perfect.
4.0,"This dress is so pretty and looks exactly like the picture! Its a little long on me, I'm 5'2, so I will have to hem it.  If you are 2-3 inches taller, it will fit you perfectly.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit on the large size.  I usually wear a L or XL.  I ordered the L and it was still rather big.  I exchanged it for a Medium which I'm sure will fit great.  Overall, very happy."
4.0,"They are lovely - shorter posts, which I like.  The only thing is they ARE small.  if you want a 5mm ball, get at least a 6mm. I compaired other 5 mm balls in pictures - on ears so I could see the size more clearly - they were larger."
4.0,Slip rides up but I just cut out internal slip and bought my own. Bead work is beautiful!
4.0,Too small. Good customer service
4.0,"I ordered a medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 120lbs. It‚Äôs a little big but looks just fine with a belt. I didn‚Äôt get a better photo than this one. The bust area is very short, like the rest of the reviews say and I‚Äôm quite small chested but the color is fantastic! I get complimented every time I wear it."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 36c, 136 pounds, bought the pink in a medium. Fits perfectly. Very soft. Attractive. Very warm. Definitely worth buying. Product arrived on time, nicely packaged. Thank you."
4.0,Really nice quality and print. The prints a little blurry but over all it‚Äôs great
4.0,soft nice top  - looks good with leggings
4.0,"I got this just before vacation, so I used it extensively in a tropical setting and it worked very well.  It has just enough stretch to enable you to set it tight to the wrist without it cutting off your circulation.<br /><br />My two concerns (not proven out yet) - it feels like it could tear because of the stretch.  I don‚Äôt think it will, but since I‚Äôm used to more rigid watch bands on my Apple Watches, it was a little concerning.  The other issue is with the loop to hold the excess band.  It‚Äôs a good deal larger than the band, so the tail of the band seems to be a little freer than I would like and therefore catches on more things.<br /><br />For the money, it‚Äôs a good alternative to the Apple OEM version.  In a week of testing in salt, sand and water, I never had any issues with it.  It even shrugged off sunscreen with a little wipe down with a towel."
4.0,"The socks were a Father's Day gift as my dad had requested some better footwear  for hiking.  Although the socks were decent, I was disappointed because the picture made it look like they included a waterproof zippered pouch which would have been nice for when he goes canoeing and needs additional dry socks - the included pouch is definitely NOT waterproof as it came with holes punched in it and there was price tag adhesive on it which I could not remove.  Good socks though, dad seemed pleased with them!"
4.0,Looks great with my mustard dress
4.0,"Ordered blue, received black. Still looks amazing!"
4.0,"This is our second pair of these glasses for our daughter, we like that they are polarized and they fit her well, however they keep breaking at the arm attachment (this is why we ordered another pair). I looked for a way to contact someone at the company but didn't see any contact info so I'm posting here."
4.0,The sleeve has buttoned cuff which requires exact fit to arm length.
4.0,"This isn‚Äôt a bad ring and it is overly large as described.  My issue with it is the top is completely flat, so when wearing and trying to type the two fingers on either side of it run into a ceiling of sorts.  Also, there is a point on this ring that sticks out on the metal edge.  I am going to have to either cut it down with snips or file it down.  Adjustable size bad stretches out at the bottom of the band; it isn‚Äôt quiet round but more oval.  I have had to adjust the band to be comfortable.  This does look good when worn but it isn‚Äôt my favorite costume item."
4.0,queda como se esperaba
4.0,Loved how much I could get into this bag.  The only down size was the wheels didn't go sideways for me to pull along side the wheelchair I have to ride in at the airport.
4.0,"My second pair of Calabria Glasses I use as my back up pair they are always in my hand bag just in case I mistakenly forget or leave my glasses home or some place else.<br />I like the light weight and the attractive red color  my first pair has , second pair was NOT the SAME color RED."
4.0,"I love boots, only they have strong unpleasant smell. How get rid of it?"
4.0,I had fun tying this head wrap in different styles. It is made good and not see through at all.
4.0,It‚Äôs wonderful watch
4.0,It worked out very well for my Halloween costume as Cleopatra.
4.0,Cool color  black Suevi
4.0,I have really thick mid back length hair and this covers it when it‚Äôs all in a bun. Comfortable and does the job
4.0,I love the way these lil boots look and fit. They light up perfect and my 4 year old daughter loves them. The only thing I don't like is the heart button gets caught on everything when she's playing or even riding in the basket at the store. One has already fallen off and the other on the way but we will sew back on. Just glad we didn't lose the button! You have to be very careful and just wear them for looks and maybe no or light play.
4.0,Good looking shoe.
4.0,This is a really nice dress just that you should purchase a size up.
4.0,IT A TO LONG I HAVE TO HIMEIT
4.0,Product lived up to its online representation
4.0,Their Okay.
4.0,"These are dead on for the new Prada's , that are out right now . You can't tell the difference one bit . They are large , so if you are not looking for Big then these are not it . They come packaged beautiful . Cleaning cloth, case etc. why pay so much when you,can  get these and look like the same thing, but for hundreds less . There is a few , so you can find your right size ?"
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weigh 160lbs. I ordered a large and it fit well.
4.0,"I hate floppy, no structure hats. This is a well made cap with plenty of body. It's got a really stout brim too."
4.0,"I bought these shoes for my 4 year old daughter, who is very fond of peppa pig. I got size 11 for her (as she is little tall for her age) and it fits perfectly on her feet. She was very happy to see them, when I opened the package. The shoes were nicely packed and reached on time. As, the name says light up shoes, it is true, but only for one shoe because the other one lights up occasionally. Although, my daughter is contended with that only but I I was hoping that it would have been great, if both the shoes lights up at the same time. She is easily spotted in the dark because of her glowing shoe.<br />As far as the weight of the shoes is concerned, I would say that they are on a bit heavier side as I have bought other sneakers for my daughter that are comparatively lighter in weight. My daughter is using these shoes since past two weeks, so I cannot comment on its durability, but considering she wears them almost every alternate day, they look good to me.<br /><br />If you are not very much concerned with the weight of the sneakers, they are a good deal !"
4.0,"I find it a bit hard to buy a bag online--even after reviewing the dimensions, it's difficult to get a good feel for the size.  I purchased this bag after using a larger hobo-style bag.  That back was cute, but SO hard to find things due to the style!  Given that, I was attracted to the multiple compartments of this bag and the more medium size.  Plus, it was available in green, my favorite color.<br /><br />This bag arrived nicely packaged, although the strap was wrapped up and placed inside the bag, which caused folds/kinks in the strap that took awhile to work out.  Although the bag is not leather, it seems to be of very good quality, with strong seams and nice touches such as the covered zippers.  Although the strap could be adjusted to be long enough, I find this bag a little on the large size to wear cross-body, but that's just a personal preference.  I was able to fit all the things I usually carry in this bag.  I thought that the outside zipper compartments might feel over-stuffed, but they really don't.  However, there is not a huge amount of space in the main compartment--I find that my (largish) wallet takes up most of it.<br /><br />Overall, this is an attractive bag that organizes my stuff way, and I would recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/24/19:<br />I am still using this bag, and I've actually gotten several compliments on it recently.  It is unique in color (mine is green) and style.  I do wish that it had another inch or so of depth to it, making the main compartment a little bigger.  Also, the small zipper for the pocket on the outside back has started to pull away at the seam over repeated use.  Otherwise, I am still happy with this bag."
4.0,It fits great and worked for my ho.ecomeing outfit and Halloween!
4.0,These worked for me.
4.0,"Totally fun.<br /><br />Could be a tish wider, but they do ok.<br /><br />I did not get a storage pouch as shown in some photos, but that's ok."
4.0,"This gown is nice, but seen to run small I like the color and softness"
4.0,Amazing ...love it so much
4.0,The picture looks better and they are and they are not for allergy sensitive ears.
4.0,I wish the material was a little thicker
4.0,"The product seems well made, but is small for me. I like one that is able to cover my nose and fit over my chin so my glasses don't fog and I can talk easily."
4.0,It is pretty and dainty. Lovely ring. and simply stated.
4.0,"I've absolutely loved Isaac Liev clothes for a couple of years now. They were perfect work/play tunic/tshirts and go great with leggings or jeans. I have the cap sleve, the short sleve with pockets, and the long sleeve with pockets.<br />Recently however, they seem to have changed their cuts. Shirts are fitting a size smaller and are a little shorter as well.<br />Unfortunately, for me, they don't carry a size up. If you can go up one size and length isn't an issue, these are fantastic, lightweight, and flowy shirts."
4.0,Fit perfectly with my frames. Even included a mini screw driver
4.0,"Good wallet, currently impossible to order the camel color because the name all ways shows as brown even when viewing the page for the camel color"
4.0,"Perfect for our Jamaica trip coming up.  Looks really beachy.  Very soft velvety felt material on the backside.  None of the stones are loose on mine, as some of the other reviews said."
4.0,Great eyeglasses for the price! I would purchase them again.
4.0,"This item arrived a little too quickly. Meaning it came with several loose threads and improper dieing (dying?) . Anyways the product is flawed, but looks cute. It is a little small in the bust and it is that material that sticks to you."
4.0,Item is good quality and just as pictured. Made of a sturdy fabric.
4.0,I haven't  worn them yet... but they're cute. I wish the gold bar was longer across the top of the frames. It would help bring out the gold accents and add more flare. That's  the only thing negative  I have ...they're still a great buy
4.0,I like that the hat keeps it shape is very cool to wear in both ways and is just fabulous and good way to march ahead.
4.0,"Runs a bit small, but they are super comfy!"
4.0,I bought many of these in the past and absolutely love them have them in several different colors I'm sad to see that they changed the material they're making the shirts out of
4.0,Very good i liked so much
4.0,Super cute in person
4.0,"Very happy with this ring. Stone size is nice. Only took one star off is the look of the sterling silver. But for the cost is looks fine, you can't expect a jewelry store look for the cost you pay for this. Would have liked one of the names closer to the stone. The fit seems true to the size. Would buy again if I get this for grandchildren."
4.0,I  haven't had this very long<br />  So far looks great!
4.0,"I really liked this ring because it's dainty but beautiful. Unfortunately, after the second day wearing it I noticed a stone missing. I'm hesitant to order a replacement."
4.0,The neck line wasn't as a deep V as I was hoping. But it's still a good shirt. And I'm happy with my purchase
4.0,Enhanced best asset
4.0,Great looking but they have a tendency to need adjusting when wearing.
4.0,good inexpensive earrings for Fall/Thanksgiving season
4.0,I like this dress because it's good to not be very fancy but also not seem like you'd be a lazy type of person to lounge around the house in pajamas. The length of the skirt is right it doesn't get shorter in the back and the zipper makes it easier to get into. The top part is more of a stiff fabric that is sort of scratchy but not like sequins that are uncomfortable and the bottom is like thicker cotton. I just think that the size large fits but always around the shoulders is too tight for me so I won't be able to keep wearing it for as long as I want to have it in my wardrobe.
4.0,"Great material--nice, thick-ish, stretchy material. Gives the impression that it can be dressed up or down, which is great! This too does run big. I rad the comments and ordered a medium (5'6&#34; 156 lbs 36C bra) when I generally wear a large in tops like this. The medium is too large on me to look okay. I probably could have gone with a small (shocking!) and it would have fit the way I wanted. Customer service was great though and it's a great top for the price!"
4.0,They‚Äôre pretty snug but they fit
4.0,"ok so the product fabric kinda feels a bit weird just a little bit but it‚Äôs still good to sleep in , the elastic gets stretched out pretty fast and fits weird on my head but overall it‚Äôs not that bad."
4.0,It was a nice gift for a little boys birthday gift.  He really liked it.  I just gave it to him yesterday.
4.0,"Excellent fit. True to color. Maybe not the highest quality but great for the price. Shipping from China cost as much as the dress but I couldn't wait for snail mail. I will use this as part of my Halloween costume as &#34;popcorn&#34;. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"My son begged for this hoodie and I finally gave in. The fit of the medium was excellent for my 13 year old son, the design is great and overall quality is pretty good. My only complaint is he caught the pocket on something and all the stitching pulled out the entire top portion of the pocket; luckily I was able to not only fix it but I also reinforced it so hopefully it doesn't happen again."
4.0,"It is only 2.5 mm wide and the picture makes it look bigger than what it really is. It's gold and it shines, I've had compliments. I just want a bigger chain necklace. I bought a 5.0 mm Cuban Curb at 26.0 inches long. I'm going to wear both."
4.0,This is a good watch for the price but remember it has a small display. So if your vision is not the greatest this watch may not be for you. Good watch for work.
4.0,I was impressed with the quality of this dress. The fabric is thick and the zippers secure. The dress fits very well and contours to curves well without any bulky fabric!
4.0,I had to hem it a good two inches.  I probably should have ordered large.  But it is fine for a summer robe.
4.0,"Fun bezels, one broke before arrival, but the others were fine."
4.0,"Really good quality! I wash it cold and hang it to dry, but sometimes my roommate throws it in the dryer when he's trying to get his own laundry done, and it still looks fine! I wear this about once a week, and I always receive compliments on it. I've ironed it. Both a warm and cool iron work on this dress, plus I've used steam before. The only problem is that it wrinkles really easily, but it also irons really easily, so I guess that is not much of a problem! It came with a few loose strings, especially around the heart-shaped buttons, but they were non-essential. The tie around the waist is really long! I can wrap it around myself twice and still tie a pretty good bow (32&#34; waist). Normally, I wrap it once to get a nice, big bow in the back or front, wherever I decide to tie it."
4.0,I love it. I may could have gone a size larger. But I'm still happy with purchase and will be wearing on my upcoming cruise!
4.0,it fits well just the hand is way too big
4.0,"It is decent enough belt, but it runs extremely large. I made it smaller so I could wear it."
4.0,"This is a better watch than I expected for the price.  Clever, conversation starter and very accurate watch.  Even the band is pretty substantial.  And it will fit most wrists...men and women.<br />It does take a long time to receive it as it come by slow boat from China."
4.0,"The belt is solid and functions appropriately. I knocked off a star because the nylon is very stiff and coarse, and no matter how many times I wear it, it hasn‚Äôt softened. There are times when it rubs against the skin enough to make it annoying. If you are looking for an inexpensive belt for outdoor activities that isn‚Äôt leather or cotton, then this could be an option. The belt buckle does funtion as a bottle opener in times of &#34;emergancy,&#34; albeit the angle was kind of awkward."
4.0,"It looks a little cheap, but it actually works well and it is not lose so I would recommend it."
4.0,Very happy with the scrubs and lab coat. My daughter is small for her age but I was able to just roll up the sleeves and pant legs. The quality of the product isn't the best but it will due and my daughter loves it.
4.0,Worked well for packing. They were STUFFED and the zipper held up.
4.0,As advertised.  Received on time.<br />Thanks ~ PJR
4.0,"I like almost everything about this purse: the weight, style, looks, etc.  The only thing I'm not too crazy about is that on two of the front pockets, the zipper goes around a corner and  I have to open and close it all the way to gain access to the inside.  I would have liked two zippers on these pockets so that it would make it easier to close and retrieve items from the top."
4.0,Somewhat flimsy but my daughter was thrilled. Hard to adjust head size.
4.0,"Great hoodie! Fit more like a sweatshirt. Very fitted, stylish and warm! Neon was a little darker than expected but would purchase other colors."
4.0,"Great shape, odd ""gold "" color"
4.0,Good value and fit.
4.0,"This product worked very well for what I need it for.  It's pretty simple to use and will not bounce as much with motion as the hat mount.  The only downside to that is, you can't wear a hat."
4.0,i bought this hat because of my frequent trips to southeast asia and summers on the coastline of the carolinas.<br />it is a perfect accessory for casual sporting and trekking. Very comfortable for long hours of wear.<br />I advise to wash the hat a few times as it does shrink slightly.
4.0,These gloves fit my 6 year old son slightly big so there is room to grow but not so big that he can't use them comfortably.  It seems that the pair of gloves with the skeleton design cannot be used for touch screen however the other pair with the dots can be.  This was a bit disappointing especially because my son really preferred the skeleton design.
4.0,"I brought this for my 26 months old son for spring season, size just right, material is soft and light.<br />The reason I am giving 4 stars is because it will shrink a little after a few wash even I hang dry it. Just get the  next size because it worth it. This is one of  the item I will buy again."
4.0,"Good for lighter, cooler days.  It's not as hot as other neck gaiters"
4.0,"I bought this for my bachelorette party & was very pleased. Super comfortable & not to mention, super cute. I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù 165lbs and it fit me well. Only complaint is the poor quality button up top. The first time I tried it on it popped off. Had to use a safety pin for my bach party but you couldn‚Äôt tell."
4.0,"I like the dress, glad I ordered up a size it FITS SMALL. The material isn‚Äôt cotton it‚Äôs more like swimsuit material but it‚Äôs cute."
4.0,"really cute and good quality material, but the underarms are very tight. It was the perfect size for my daughter otherwise had to return because it hurt her underarms. She was really disappointed because she wanted to keep it but ordering one size up would have been too big."
4.0,He‚Äôs nice but he‚Äôs too big
4.0,The quality of fabric could use some improvement
4.0,So many screws.... Seems to work well however.
4.0,It is pretty good quality but the tutu isn‚Äôt as puffy as what I thought. It‚Äôs still a pretty good buy.
4.0,"Fit my daughter perfectly expect in the top where it was loose, but we expected that.  A little nip and tuck under the arms and it fits her great.  Color was perfect too!"
4.0,Seem to be good quality. Accurate color.<br /><br />They're shorter than I thought they'd be. I added them to my new Converse sneakers and you can see there isn't much left over. It'll work but it'll be a bit awkward. Probably meant for kids or shoes that have fewer lace holes.
4.0,"Beautiful, my wife loves them. Ordered blue and got green, turns out she likes the green more. They gave me 20% off my next order, even though I told them green was good."
4.0,Product description is accurate.  Locket is difficult to open though.
4.0,"The other reviews aren‚Äôt kidding about these being hard to put on! You better have a strong arm, a leatherman and an hour to kill. After that they are beautiful and fit well."
4.0,nice one . looks good. good value of money .
4.0,Three of the four bras fit. The fourth one was too small. Pretty bras though.
4.0,My daughter loves these shoes! The only down side is the laces that come with the shoes are too short to even lace all the way to the top of the eyelets. We solved this problem by putting in some expanders laces that are stretchy and have clips to hold the laces in place and prevent the &#34;tied shoelaces look&#34;.
4.0,"Fits well and the optics are good.  They are darker than the similar type of original Oakley lens, but still work fine in high light situations.  They aren't the super optic quality of genuine Oakley lenses, but there is no distortion, clouding or any other issue and for this price it is a very good alternative to throwing out perfectly functional, expensive frames simply because Oakley doesn't make lenses for them anymore.  I will be using these as replacements until I manage to break the Oakley frames.  It has been somewhere around 20 years so far so I hope Mryok keeps making these to fit my frames!"
4.0,"First, I did receive this watch free for the purpose of testing and review. While I recognize that a review of a free product is fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid, I do take reviewing seriously, and so I am hopeful that my findings will prove helpful to you in your decision making. If you have questions about the watch, post them in the comments section and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience with the product.<br /><br />What you're getting with this order:<br />(1) Bracelet style watch<br />(1) set written instructions<br /><br />What is this watch, and what makes it different from a regular watch?:<br />This is a bracelet style watch, done in black stainless steel.  The main difference in this watch from others is that there is no visible face when the lights are not activated. In other words, the entire watch looks like a watch band.  However, when a button is pushed to display the time, the letters glow out from the watchband and are easy to see. The watch can be toggled between time (hour and minute), date, and finally seconds. The display is large, taking up most of the dorsal side of your wrist.<br /><br />Does it work?:<br />Yes, it works quite well. I've tested the watch and have the following observations to share:<br /><br />Appearance: The color is somewhere between black and gunmetal grey.  The entire watch, when the display is not activated appears to be bracelet made from a watch band.  It has two prominent buttons on the right side of the watch &quot;face&quot; itself.  These buttons are explained in the instructions that accompany the watch.  They are also listed here in the product description.<br /><br />Build:  The watch is built from stainless steel and feel quite durable (I've owned it for a month now and have experienced no problems). The weakest point on the watch feels like its clasp as it is light weight and small, but I have yet to have any difficulty with it. Overall, build is solid for a sub $10 watch. The band will be small on larger wearers. I have a medium frame and I use up every last centimeter of this band.<br /><br />Function: The watch is not easy to set initially.  You have to spend some time with the instructions, and even then it takes a little practice to move through each step.  But once you understand the process, it goes quite smoothly.  Once the watch is set, you just push the top button to see the time and then again to toggle through the other displays. The display itself is quite large and plenty bright, even in broad daylight.<br /><br />Anything else of note?:As of the posting of this review, the watch is eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime; that's always a check in the plus column for me.<br /><br />Any negatives?:<br />-The band itself is not very long, and at 8.35&quot;, it may be too short for larger people.<br />-Clasp mechanism is difficult to manipulate one handed so donning the watch independently is not simple.<br />-The clasp is very difficult to undo one handed, especially if you wear the watch infrequently and don't remember exactly how it works.<br />-The faceless design is very unique and not likely to please everybody.  It may be too odd for some.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a very interesting design concept that is being offered at the lower end of the budget price range. It displays time and date in a unique manner that is likely to please many younger shoppers who appreciate something modern and new. The build has proven to be sturdy so far and the watch has a moderate ease of use with most difficulty centering around donning/doffing via the tiny clasp.  Being unique and unusual, it is not likely to please users who prefer a more conservative watch style.  Enjoy!"
4.0,"I originally made a mistake thinking my heels were not stilettos and had to order both sizes, but very happy with the stiletto fit. I put that they did not provide good arch support as this is not their purpose."
4.0,"Nice, look just like what you see!"
4.0,The dress fit as expected. The larger bow at the top is a little awkward and needs a little extra attention. Overall the dress was beautiful and made very well.
4.0,Recommended purchase
4.0,"Runs small, tight around thighs. Good quality and cute to wear with knee high boots though."
4.0,"Love this suit, but it runs a little small. Order a size larger."
4.0,I loved everything about this bag except for the long strap for the cross body. I tried adjusting it but  it just didn‚Äôt look right. I thought it could be removed but that was not the case. Based on that I returned it.
4.0,"Stylish no doubt. But material not that soft. Kinda rough. Also the bouffant isn't that ""bouffantish . """
4.0,"Like the band, it looks nice. But it is itchy and turns on my wrist."
4.0,"Love the style of this top!  I bought one in black, and liked it enough to order two more in the same size...brown & wine.  They arrived, but unfortunately were both at least one size smaller.  I contacted the seller regarding their problem with size inconsistency.  They responded that they would make that their high priority.  With that in mind, I highly recommend this top."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e30532c0507a1ed99b692830039797c1]] great fast delivery by amazon , nice packaging, with a scent of motor oil makes it a plus on , good and fair price"
4.0,Stainless Steel keeps the price low.  Good quality does not make it look cheap.
4.0,This fit good but is more a mini skirt than let on in the description.
4.0,"Beautiful! Ordered 2xl where I usually wear xl & it fit well. Just a heads up: It is backless & that cute little keyhole in the front it larger than I expected. It's somewhat adjustable, but you're stealing from side-boob coverage to cover cleavage."
4.0,"The ring is beautiful and unique in design, and true to size.  It was missing a blue stone when it arrived, but I will keep it and enjoy wearing it.  That is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.  Also, the packaging was a disappointment.  It came in a pouch but only in a brown envelope.  Thankfully, it made it through the mail without damage.  Still, gorgeous piece at a more than reasonable price."
4.0,"I've worn these shoes a few times already and am mostly pleased. I'm normally an 8.5 or 9 and I went with the 9 and they fit fine. They're very comfortable on, but be warned they are very flat (which is in their picture so I was expecting it) so there's little to no arch support. Only complaint I have is that they're pretty easy to scuff up and the material on the sole of the shoe (the tan/brown stuff) then starts to peel off when that happens. But for the price it's good."
4.0,They are cute. I'm only returning because I bought another pair that have the touch pad on the fingertip so you can use your phone. These have an anti slip on the palm for driving or holding a phone but no touch pad.
4.0,"These Denim Jeans Legging from Saferin is one of my favorites. Comfortable & Stylish. Accentuates my curves in all the right places.<br /><br /> ~*~*~<br /> DESIGN:<br /> * Beautiful Baby Blue Color<br /> * Lightweight Material<br /> * High Rise<br /> * Real Back Pockets<br /> * Elastic Waistband<br /> * Machine Washable (Cold Cycle)<br /> * Fashion Hem Strip<br /><br /> ~*~*~<br /><br />I am 5'4 @ 145lbs and ordered this in a size Medium. The fit is perfect & the length reached my ankles nicely.<br /><br />Putting them on for the first time was with ease. Truly soft material making them comfortable. Hubby said they seem to be hugging my curves.<br /><br />The High Rise helped camouflage my &#34;love handles&#34;. Plus I didn't have to keep pulling them up like my other Jeggings.<br /><br />The style allows me to fashionably wear with a sexy tunic top & heals for a girls night out. Or sweatshirt & sneakers for game night, yet still look girly :-)<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed. Hope the uploaded pictures are detailed enough.<br /><br />***<br /> DISCLAIMER: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED review."
4.0,"This is a lovely wallet, but my phone did not fit (the dimensions given don't account for the fabric on the inside which prevented my phone from fitting). I wanted a wallet that I could use to store my phone and zip up my cards. The wallet itself is very nice, seems high quality. Packaged well. Return was a quick and easy process. I definitely recommend this wallet (for smaller phones)."
4.0,"Strobe lights? Welding? High intensity lasers? None of these will be a problem ever again with these sunglasses! No light can stand the limousine blackout intensity of their sheer blackness. Make the Sun your bitch! Your neighbors flood lights can suck it! That ghetto bird may be able to spot you, but you'll never have to see it with the Original OG Mad Dogger Locs."
4.0,Medium fit well over black woman natural hair. my hair is this and in an afro. the bonett fits well the rim was stiff but I guess you can break it in. I used it as a halloween costume as a baby.
4.0,Well the chain is not the same as shown in this pic but overall nothing happened so far<br />Has been about a month<br />I think works great for this price
4.0,A little big for my 2 year old. I put them away for next year. They seem to be very durable and decent quality overall. They also arrive with a carrier case which is a bonus!
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my brother. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but he‚Äôs happy with it.
4.0,"While I really like the lightweight feel of this for hot summer months, I do wish the breast area had just a little more material as the lightweight seethrough material does require a rob when walking around the house."
4.0,"A little on the small side in terms of length but very cute, my girls love them"
4.0,Not a great fit but still comfortable
4.0,"Very comfortable, good fit, going to buy again in another color. I did buy one in brown."
4.0,A little big but great lines. I had to pay more to get it tailored to fit me than what I paid for the dress but it‚Äôs worth it.
4.0,"Smartest purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time! Strapless bras are absolutely impossible when you have a big chest and this fixed all of the issues. I‚Äôve recommended it to so many friends, coworkers, and strangers. üòÇ I wish I would‚Äôve bought another just as a backup."
4.0,"I like these shoes a lot, but they run a tad small. The color pops and doesn‚Äôt show dirt much. Get 1/2 size up. I got an 8, should have got an 8 1/2. Good support. Unfortunately, the soles will wear fairly quickly wearing these on hard court outdoor surfaces for pickleball. Better for indoor gym surface floors."
4.0,"I was pleased with the tunics that I ordered.  The fit was very flattering and the fabric is cool and comfortable to wear.  Both were true to size and the fabric has a little give to it.  Plenty of armhole space that some other shirts are often tight in.  My only dislike was that the coral one, was not true to color.  The photo shows one that appears to be a brownish/orange.  Mine came as a BRIGHT orange."
4.0,"The t-shirt I received is a little different than what is pictured.  I Ordered the Rose Gold.  The picture shows the Beth Dutton underlined in white, but it is underlined in Gold.  The t-shirt is soft and stretchy and fits great, but the grey color has a little brown to it.  It does go with the rose gold lettering.  I was wanting to wear this in the summer, but without the white underline and the brownish-grey color it looks more fall-ish and kind of cheap."
4.0,"Good fit, but color is orange not pink as shown in display"
4.0,It didn‚Äôt fit me well but cute.
4.0,"One of the speakers was broken, otherwise I would of given 5 stars! The hat is great!"
4.0,It's really comfortable materials really great unfortunately it didn't fit around my chest normally when I order an extra large I believe it usually fits me perfectly but besides that it's really cute.
4.0,"You definitely get what you pay for here. Of course, everything is plastic or cheap fabric. Don't go running or anything like that while wearing it, because it could fall off/fall apart.<br />But, really, it's a nice piece. Worth the money, for sure."
4.0,Came with instructions and punch to allow adjustment of belt size.
4.0,"This dress is super stretchy in a t-shirt like material. I got the green and it is a beautiful shade of green that can be worn year round. The uneven hem, I have tried other dresses like this and the short parts were always too short. This one is a bit longer and so that's not a problem for me with this dress.  4 stars for 2 reasons: 1. While the dress has pockets, they are not deep enough to trust putting anything in them except your hands. 2. I got this in a size larger than I normally wear and it was still clingy and unforgiving from the waist down so I would say it runs small."
4.0,This hat is awesome and my customers are all impressed and it arrived earlier than i was expected
4.0,Top is kinda small
4.0,"I absolutely love my grass green skirt. Great quality, perfect length but the waist was a bit snug. I'm 204lbs, sz 14 or 1x in clothes & I ordered a sz XXL in this skirt. I will order more colors but I'll remove the zipper & add elastic since it's so affordable."
4.0,"Solid, looks good, and is sturdy.  The clasp is a bit annoying when new, but after a few days worth of use, it becomes more managable.  That said, the clasp definitely looks a bit cheap relative to the rest of the bracelet.  Definitely good quality for the price and if they had a better finish and maybe a bit more heft on the clasp, it would get 5 stars..."
4.0,Little stiff to fold and put them in the pocket. But well-made. Should last a couple of seasons.
4.0,"This band looks really nice and fits my watch perfectly. The only reason I docked a star is because the ends of the band always get caught on the buckle making it hard to slide in and it has caught almost every time I put it on and is starting to tear on the sides. Also, the band is a little stiff in comparison to the original band that came with my Timex."
4.0,"The straps are great and helpful in getting my preschooler's glasses to stop falling on the ground. I can't get the little ""behind the ear"" pieces onto the glasses because they're way too small for the eyeglass arms, which I'm pretty bummed about, but not a deal breaker since the straps work well on their own."
4.0,Worked perfect for my DIY tomato cage witch. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the hair was thin  and tangled easy.
4.0,This shirt  fits well. I don't need to wear an undershirt. A black bra worked just nicely.
4.0,"I fell in Love with some of these slip dresses, in solid colors.  They are lined, silky feeling, perfect length, something I go to often, living in a tropical warm climate.<br /><br />I came back to Amazon to get some more, and this time I ordered some of the print ones also.  They just arrived  -- the prints and the solid dresses are Completely Different!!<br /><br />The solid dresses have a silky lining and a criss-cross strap pattern in the back.  The print ones are a simple, single-layer spaghetti strap dress, with adjustable strap length.<br /><br />The print dresses are much shorter, at least 6"" shorter, and don't have the curved hem.  The solid color dresses fall below the knee, and the print ones come several inches above the knee.<br /><br />The armholes are cut much wider on the print fabric dresses and the neckline falls lower.<br /><br />All of them are bias-cut, so that give them a nice way of hanging, some drape.  Please note - the white dress in photo just came out of the package and shows some wrinkling, but that will naturally fall out now that it's on a hanger.<br /><br />The solid ones are easy care and feel like a dream to wear, so light, smooth and comfortable.  I don't know about the print ones, as they do not fit me well, and I won't be able to wear them.<br /><br />Take a careful look at how the different ones are shown on the models... Not sure why they are all grouped together as if variations on the same dress, just be sure which one(s) you would really prefer before ordering."
4.0,"This is absolutely not an 18g. I was legitimately surprised at how thick it was, it's quite a bit thicker than any of my other nose rings and is most likely a 16 or 14g. With that said though it's very cute once you get it in and is pretty comfortable."
4.0,I liked that the padding is removable. The medium size is smaller than expected.
4.0,the sizing tool broke
4.0,"This is a great design and cool looking jersey.  Unfortunately, I used their sizing chart and the product was too big.  I suspect the jersey was mislabeled (XXL rather than XL)."
4.0,Absolutely adorable shoes! The perfect princess shoes and my daughter got tons of compliments. The only issue is that my daughter complains about them being itchy when she wears them without tights.
4.0,Nice dress to go out with friends!
4.0,"Could hold 6 photos, but 2 of the spaces are concave so can't put pictures in it"
4.0,My husband wears it a lot and is very durable after months and months of use.
4.0,They are very comfortable and stay up fine while doing Zumba. I wish they had some other color selections because I would buy more.
4.0,Came compacted but opened nicely
4.0,"I think these are better made somehow, these are good and not to bullky like some over glasses sunglasses are so these are good."
4.0,Good running hat... one size fits most.
4.0,It's not worth 35$ but it is a cute dress... Looks a little better in the pics here.. Very long on and I'm 5'9&#34;
4.0,"Nice, comfortable and warm. Looks very nice. Pills a little too easily but hard to complain for the price"
4.0,"ADORABLE!! I absolutely LOVE this shirt! It is a little see through, but a tank top under it works great! I ordered a large and it fits great:)"
4.0,"its a nice bracelet for the price, but does run a little tight."
4.0,"Went to this belt from a traditional ratchet belt, was on my 2nd ratchet belt, the end where the belt meets the buckle kept ripping out and I'd trim the belt more and more till it got too small to continue to use. I did this with two belts over the last year and finally had enough; figured id try this nylon belt. When I pulled it out of the package I had serious doubts that the slider bar would have enough tension to hold the belt when using ""in the field"". I am pleasantly surprised to say this has been working well for the last two days, stays tight and keeps my pants up. We will see how this holds over time but for now its a-ok!"
4.0,"I love this short, but it is smaller than advertised. I guess I‚Äôm on a diet"
4.0,"I loved this suit. It is adorable and covers nicely. Unfortunately, I had to return it. I am 5'11&#34; and the mesh on the chest was too low and exposed part of my nipples."
4.0,"Adorable pattern and very durable! I only wish the black logo ‚ÄúThe Bag Bag‚Äù was smaller and located at the bottom, or was in a coordinating color that blends in a little more. Over all, I love it!"
4.0,"I love the &#34;chic-nest, funky-nest&#34; style of the shoes! The  height & chunky heel  is a plus,  my only complaint is they are NOT a white  like shown in the picture !!! That's a huge problem for me because  I purchased them for a  white & black outfit I bought, these shoes are a  more  cream/ivory. I  really wish they  would stop with the false advertising.  We  customers  purchase online  based  on the pictures shown & description/ details/ reviews. I  purchased them specifically for  a  particular outfit.  Though I'm very disappointed, I'll keep them."
4.0,Very nice necklace. Seems sturdy. Clasp is good. Very happy. Good price.
4.0,"Nice authentic coach shoes, really nice."
4.0,"Soy L y ped√≠ XL que es la recomendaci√≥n siento que me quedo justo, pero no es que me apriete. En cuanto al secado r√°pido no lo tiene debido a que hoy me lo estren√© y a pesar que es v√≠a al mar (con brisa) al finalizar el recorrido la camisa estaba bastante h√∫meda en las axilas.<br />En cuanto al dise√±o y estado del producto a gustado mucho a las personas que lo han visto pues es mi gracioso y llamativo."
4.0,Get a size up but good underwear
4.0,"This is a precious, well-made necklace."
4.0,Pretty too but don't exactly stay up on your ears.
4.0,"I ordered a small. I am 5'1, 115 lbs, 34 D. The dress was too big ( slightly) and way too long for my liking. It's not a bad dress- felt nice, soft, and comfy but did not fit how I wanted it too - so I ended up returning it. I would recommend this for a taller girl."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  It is comfortable to wear and so far it is keeping time.
4.0,Nice bracelet.  I little large for my wrist but I do like it &amp; it layers nicely with other jewelry.
4.0,"Very soft, comfortable sweat shirt"
4.0,"The watch is amazing. It's really neat (though setting time isn't in the instructions. To set it there's a screw that looks like a flathead screw but if you turn it, it sets the time), but it's a little cheap for $40 (the casing is plastic and the sound quality is poorish) but overall I've enjoyed the clock (even though I've had it for less than two hours now!)."
4.0,Nice for the price. Color is good. Fit is good.
4.0,"My 5 year old has a heck of a time keeping his mask on, but we seem to have found one that suits him. He loves animals so having an alligator or a tiger face is fun for him (though he tends to pretend to be the animal--not always in the most appropriate circumstances.) It is spacious with still being form fitting and the ear loops are adjustable which is great. The mask stays on during an entire T-ball game without slipping off during play which is great. The cloth is rather thick with two layers. There is no pocket for a filter, but it works pretty well regardless. It fully covers my son's nose and mouth without slipping. Very cute."
4.0,"This is really big, but I like to wear my clothes tight because I am an hour glass figure. I usually wear Medium... I ordered a small & it was still bigger than I am use to. I think this would look better on a lady with small breast. I think I am going to gift it to a friend (with a smaller chest). I think it would be a great top for breast feeding. It is really comfortable."
4.0,I brought this product for my sneaker shoe
4.0,Just as I thought!!Like it!!
4.0,"This makes a fun mobile. The string included with the set was too stretchy to tie, so I used different string to set up the flying keys."
4.0,I would rate these more of a medium support bra - would not suggest for big breasted women in high impact exercise. These are fantastic for low impact and or just comfortable daily wear.  They wash well.  Great price.
4.0,Fit and look great. 4 stars because the lenses pop out very easily when  cleaning or wiping them.
4.0,The are very comfy and true to size; however the black sandals does leave black dye on your feet.  Not a good look!
4.0,"Good watch, just to show and go. Same for the invicta watches. Not durable for construction work."
4.0,"Not heavy duty at all. 3 stitch belt, buckle is aluminum or something. Bought fro my wife to wear her gun while walking the dogs on the property, works good for that."
4.0,Came with a plastic box and googles but there was only 14 geodes not 16.i had planned on 16. irritating.
4.0,"Nice soft cleats, fit perfectly and I have a wider foot than most."
4.0,"Scarf is the perfect size and shape for many uses; neck scarf, adornment for purse, etc. It‚Äôs beautiful vibrant colors but could match so many things or add a pop of color to liven up and otherwise dull outfit. Unfortunately though one of the scarves I ordered was not the color described. The ‚Äúcoffee gray‚Äù color was coffee with a cream background. Not one streak of gray to be found. Since I purchased this scarf to match a specific blouse I wa quite disappointed."
4.0,"I was very excited to get this wallet! I really like the structure and the storage. The coloring was a little off. I got the watermelon red, and the outside coloring was pretty much the same. The only changed thing was that the outside material was slightly glossier than the pictures showed. The inside is more of a pastel pink than a tan. However, these color changes were small and did not take away from the wallet's quality."
4.0,Bracelet is real cute. The clasp is a little tricky I put it on and haven't taken it off yet. The silver hasn't turned colors all good. Very happy
4.0,"Nice watch, soild-feels heavy enough that you won't forget it's there."
4.0,this wallet is freaking awesome i got the light brown one and it looks nice the pull mechanize holds up but if you get it wet the leather gets a little discolored
4.0,"The quality of the jacket is really excellent. Nice weight, plenty of pockets, attractive color. My only complaint is that the fit was quite small compared to other jackets I own. My usual jacket is either a Medium or Large. I ordered an M1 - larger than XL - and it fit snugly through the chest and hips. Knowing that the reason for which I purchased the jacket was to load it up with items so I would not have to carry them - I am sending the M1 jacket back and re-ordering the M2 (the largest size they make for women in this style)."
4.0,Like these tanks
4.0,"You can't beat this product for the price! The colors are beautiful and vibrant, looks just like the picture. I got a large (I normally wear a medium in shirts) because I wanted it to be flowy like a kimono should, but probably could have gone with the medium and it would've been just fine. I'm super happy with the product though. Oh, and it came 2 weeks earlier than scheduled which was a great surprise!"
4.0,I am really happy with this purchase. The size chart allowed for correct ordering and the material is wonderful and dress feminine and pretty in the blue I purchaes. I would buy again!
4.0,So far so good. Fits perfect on my DJI Mavic Air remote and is quite convenient. I like the design because it allows for other accessories to be used in the 2 little slots that the other lanyard are designed to use. I intend to put a phone screen shade in those  slots.
4.0,Great . Comfortable and keep my varicose veins from hurting as much
4.0,True to size alittle see through
4.0,The kids liked the way they fit on their face.
4.0,Nice and soft..wish they were a bit bigger
4.0,"Fleece lined interior, stretchy jersey-like exterior, hood is a different texture that feels water resistant maybe? To be tested. As mentioned in other reviews, fits true to size but if you're between sizes definitely size up. Size applies to length moreso than width but it is stretchy, so you'll be comfy."
4.0,didn't notice any smell they are what they are. quality seems to be good. made a good gift and the value was there.
4.0,"Cute design and inexpensive. Fabric is a bit rough, even after laundered. Fast shipping."
4.0,Love these! I ordered a Medium/Large (I'm 5'5&#34; and 145lbs) the tag says medium and they are a little tighter than I would like but the material is stretchy so they still look good!
4.0,Material is great and I can breathe well while using this. My only complaint is that it could have been longer by an inch as it pulls my ears forward a bit
4.0,"I love these pants! They do fit true to size,  the only thing I noticed that the purple pants are a little see through. Luckily I wear big shirts to workout in. They are very comfortable.  I'll possibly buy another one in a different color."
4.0,Older grand son loved them
4.0,Great hat but I had to insert felt inside the headband so hat would fit.
4.0,"I like them, just a little tight around my calves."
4.0,It fits as expected - very tight and provided a much nicer look in my dress
4.0,Undisputedly great
4.0,"I really love this bangle. I got this color and another for my bridesmids to stack. The burnt orange color is true to the picture and it compliments my colors beautifully. The only reason this item is not getting 5 stars is becuase I kept receiving some bangles that were missing crystals, so I had to send a few bangles back at least twice before I received merchandise that was not damaged. But I will say it was well worth the wait, they are just lovely and returning the damaged items was not a hassle."
4.0,"Good material, affordable and fits well."
4.0,My daughter needed a red sports bra for basketball.  She likes the fit of this one.  Would buy again.
4.0,The hitch cover fit perfectly and works as advertised.
4.0,"Love how it looks, but only having one big cavernous space with no separations has been frustrating"
4.0,"I ordered this with apprehension due to the low cost. However, I have to say so far so good. Have just had it a few days and seems accurate. As far as easy to read it depends how old you are..lol Not a bad watch for the money."
4.0,I really like this bag.  The only problem: a decorative piece of the buckle was glued and came off.  Extra word
4.0,I got these for me and my 3 sisters. so we all have matching bracelets. They r super cute. Easy to use and tighten or losen. The heart is super cute. I have noticed tho that they r no longer silver they r more of a copper color now.
4.0,Nice basic skirt.
4.0,Not bad. About half the size I thought it would be (box). Small dent on a corner but nothing too bad. Doesn't come in plastic and it was raining outside. Had I not noticed the Amazon driver in my yard it would more than likely have been damaged. Be care when ordering this.
4.0,"Good quality dress, just a little large but I think will work."
4.0,Material is nice and holds up well in wash. A tad loose fitting and not the best shape ever but great for price. Comfortable. Could accommodate small or large bust well. Modest top if buttons up.
4.0,Elegant and high quality.  Definitely worth the money.
4.0,They're kind of goofy and fun.  I'm pleased with the purchase and they even came with a great case and cleaning cloth!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the color that is inlaid into the sides looks green in the picture but is actually light blue.  I think it looks better with the lenses anyways!
4.0,Would have given 5 stars if pads wouldnt have come all wrinkled.
4.0,Beautiful and unique.  My only concern is the bracelet stretching out over time but I have received so many compliments!
4.0,"I like the jacket, but tend to have a longer waistline and the elastic in this sat a little high on me.  Size was accurate for me (medium)."
4.0,They were great at first.  Already starting to lose elasticity which is why I didn't rate them at 5
4.0,"a little shorter than it looks in the pic, but it is nice for the price."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Great fit, color, and length. I just hand washed it under the bath tub faucet with my Castile soap and laid to dry. The tag says the color bleeds but I didn‚Äôt notice that while hand washing. Nice garment if you give it lots of tlc. üòä but if you only do machine washables and don‚Äôt have the time, skip this one."
4.0,"Looked great, was a little bigger than expected. But! Really a good item."
4.0,"Seems a little short in length, my error I guess.  The colors are great and the laces are made of good quality. However, the color image looks more yellow than the laces which are gold."
4.0,"I did not think about measuring my hand, only my wrist. Had I measured my hand I would have moved on since it is 11.5"" around at the widest part. So I could not get it over my hand sadly. It seemed really nice. The magnet was very strong. And it looked nice. It is just not for men with larger hands. So that ended up being a $10 purchase for me that ended up in the trash bin (not worth the hassles of trying to do a return on a $10 item sadly)."
4.0,"These 3 compression shirts are nicely made but they are too small for a person that weights 65 pounds.<br />Even though I have order XL size, shirts are very, very small. They could fit to a 10 year old boy.<br />I do not understand how these Chinese products can be sold by Amazon. They are wasting money on shipping products and then being returned.<br />I think buying on line is a Waste of Time.<br />I have returned these items."
4.0,I am a size L but I ordered a xl just in case it wouldn't fit me but I think I should have order a L . Anyways I liked the dress good quality:)
4.0,"The Ear cuff was a LOT smaller than I thought it would be, but it has gone on my upper right ear cartilage since I got it two weeks ago and haven't taken it off since! It's comfortable, stays on and is a pretty little thing. Of course, if I ever lost it down the drain shampooing my hair, that would be the end of it, it's so tiny! But in the meantime, I love it. A total of $7 well spent."
4.0,It was too big for my 11 year old.  I had to sew the sides to make it fit her.
4.0,Good quality for the price. The rainbow hoops were not as colorful as picture but still nice. Delivery was shorter than expected.
4.0,The balls are bigger than my expectation but this set is great.  Like it
4.0,Runs a little small but cute.
4.0,"Like the product, it was as described, but didn't receive order by date stated."
4.0,Recommend!!!! Fast delivery.
4.0,Perfect gift for any Christmas Vacation fan.  Runs a little small.
4.0,I am going to begin a water aerobics class soon. I needed a new suit. This one should work well. I am large breasted so this one isn't perfect but doable.
4.0,This is pretty good value for the money. The clasp is super hard to get open though!
4.0,"I'm a traditional medium, but this fit just a tad bit small. Still love it anyway"
4.0,If you get the right size for you.  They fit similar to a sock and the laces are only needed as they loosen over time.
4.0,"These are great for what I need. I work in a machine shop. I need to look nice for the customers, but it is an environment with dust and machine fluids. These pants are nice, but not too nice. A great price for pants that I won‚Äôt be too sad if they get coolant on them. I am ordering in a few more colors. I have only 4 stars because the pockets are only ok. There are front pockets that are half of my iPhone, and no back pockets."
4.0,"I had got this for my husband but it turned out to be a fitted style, so it fit tight in my husband. My husband ended up giving it to our son and it fit him perfectly. The material is nice but thin. It‚Äôs not fleece. It will be nice enough to wear in the summer also."
4.0,sox seem very effective after using 2 days.  They are pretty tough to install; I wish there was a better way.
4.0,I really liked this but it was too big. I ordered a large- had to return it. Will most like order a medium. I‚Äôm short (5‚Äô 4.5‚Äù  40D chest 34 waist)  and the dress hit the floor
4.0,"I bought the dress to wear to a wedding, I am a size 16 so I got XXL and the size was great. The material is stretchy and the design is nice. Nice dress for the price point but not fancy enough for me to use for the evening affair I am going to, but I will definitely wear it. Maybe for Easter Sunday Church since it has a vintage look."
4.0,"A nice lighter weight hoodie. The description made it seem like this might be T-shirt weight. It isn't something you want to wear on a very cold day, but It's suitable for both spring weather or wearing around the house without feeling overly warm. A good value, comfortable and the color is neutral so will go with any jeans or pants. Recommended. Goodthreads Brand consistently offers good quality at affordable prices."
4.0,Thin but pretty pattern and actually usable!
4.0,Not exactly the size and clarity but overall good.
4.0,You should order a size larger than your normal size to make sure you're comfortable while wearing the product.
4.0,"I reached out to the maker but never received a response. I loved everything about this headband, but it did not light up. My decision to make this purchase had to do with the light up feature."
4.0,"My 9 year old granddaughter is a true size 10/12.  This unitard, being a size 16 or XXL was TIGHT on her.  We made due because it was the largest size in the child's size and her other two dance partners were wearing the same style (color).  I wanted all three colors to match.  Also, the stitching was bad in two places, at the neck and under one arm.  Some brown thread and a needle took care of that."
4.0,"very pretty,clean casting lovely product...that being said the only way to place this over my instep (anklet) would be to add a connector to the hamsa. i wear a sz.8.5 shoe (high instep) and have a sm. women's build.so...for the average american female, this is a bracelete."
4.0,"I purchased these earrings a couple weeks ago, and I was a little disappointed on the size.  I thought they would be a little longer."
4.0,The paints are a bit larger then I need it but I love the outfit
4.0,The color is fantastic I love all of the pockets. However I do feel like it runs small I ordered a size larger then what I would for a tshirt and zipped up its a bit snug.
4.0,"I bought this to actually go under a dress I bought to give it volume. It was for a 50's style dress. Was cute all by its self too. I guess that was how it was to be worn. Nice but sometime during the night I would end up tugging it back down. Was very light, good material, and the slip that was on the inside was silky. Fits some what smaller but I will keep it I am losing weight and it will be nice to have something fit later on."
4.0,My husband loves how soft these shirts are...they do pill after washing/drying often.
4.0,"I really like it, but it smells awful. Like mothballs."
4.0,"I like the quality of this product, but I find it a bit tight fo.........r me, i ordered XXL i am. 5'4 and 138lbs and I had a bit of a hard time getting the rash guard on, after i put it in its fine."
4.0,They worked pretty well!
4.0,"My son is 2.5 years old. Initially I bought him the 1-3 years socks and they were SO SMALL. I was really disappointed. I attempted to return them and I was refunded and told to keep them. So I ordered the next size up which is a size 4-5 years old. These fit MUCH better. For reference, my kid is not big. He's 33 inches tall and 26.5 lbs. The 1-3 years old should have fit him. The 4-5 years are a little big, but better than the 1-3 years which fit like 12-24 months. I think all the 5 star reviews are due to this product being very well made. No shrinkage, but I did not put in dryer after washing, I let air dry."
4.0,"I know the scale is given in one of the photos, but still, these earrings are smaller than I expected, and this is why I awarded 4 instead of 5 stars.  That being said, they have lots of sparkle, shine and eye appeal.  They seem to be well-constructed and the design is both delicate and fun.  Very nice!"
4.0,The hat is really cute and the brim is very wide. It is well made. The fabric is not thin or very breathable but it feels soft.
4.0,"Only downfall is getting them on, the clips have to be put on after the pants are on and it gets tricky in the back."
4.0,leather construction with reasonably thick leather that should hold its shape.metal key attachments are of a simple design and appear to be designed to hold keys without loosening overall good value for the price
4.0,"I love the bottom in this suit! The top doesn‚Äôt fit me well - it‚Äôs a little too big for my chest. But I love the bottom so much that I decided to keep it to pair with a different top or to try and alter the top that came with it. The skirt/short bottom fits great, is a nice mid rise and is so cute while giving more coverage."
4.0,Fits perfect. Tried the top on when I received it but have not worn it as yet.
4.0,Smaller t h en i thought
4.0,"Cute patterns caught my eye.  I purchased to keep a couple for my bag so I'm always ready at the store, and decided to give out to family as they left our home from the holidays.  Everyone appreciated the ability to fold and store in their purses or coat pockets and the bags were roomy enough to carry their gift(s).  They too liked the pattern I chose for them"
4.0,Not US sizes. You need to order much larger size than normal. Warm and soft. Could use more stretch.
4.0,"They are good, but was sent the wrong size in one of the bands. Overall - good quality and durable."
4.0,The waist is quite tight for an xl . But I could fix it somehow.
4.0,"It's a pretty dress, but doesn't have as much &#34;twirl&#34; on the bottom as it appears it would. The glitter is nice and the gold lace on top is sparkly and nice too. The quality seems good. My problem is the top on these kind of dresses. That boxy cut doesn't always work with little girls. My daughter must be petite because this was hanging off her shoulders and exposing too much chest. I debated between a 4 and 5 because she wears a 5 in all regular clothes, but I was worried about the top. I ended up ordering the 5 anyway and thought I could just hang onto it for a while if it was too big (and she likes her dresses to be longer). Well its DEFINITELY too big. We're returning because i don't think her shoulders will ever be broad enough for this style.She is about to turn 5, weighs about 42lbs and is 43(ish)&#34; tall."
4.0,Very easy installation on my watch.  Slim secure fit and easy to clasp around wrist.  Fairly comfortable with normal movements of my wrist edges may dig into arm with extreme activity?
4.0,4 instead of 5 just because mine had a little tiny scrath in one fo the lenses.<br />Pretty good glasses for the price though.
4.0,"Had to do some adjusting, but it is very comfortable and looks good too."
4.0,"Came quickly as described, a little light shade of pink than in the pictures but still look fly."
4.0,It's made of that clingy cotton material. More comfortable to wear with a faja but I am also on the fuller side. XL / Size 12.
4.0,They came in perfect condition. At first I was a little skeptical but to my surprise they were pretty good. The only downside I have about them is that I was expecting them to be a bit taller.
4.0,"Great design with good material but too small, if you want to go for this product, go a size higher than the your normal size, the design is nice, smooth material"
4.0,I love the look of these sunglasses and the price. The only downside is I don‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre dark enough. I wish they blocked out more light.
4.0,"YUP!! It adds a cup size while holding the girls in place. Very comfy fit, I like you can actually get some housework done in this without a boob popping out of place. The padding is nice and even though it adds a cup size it's not to overwhelming with the padding."
4.0,I only deducted one star because it doesn't match the photo and I don't like ads like that. I am keep it for my grandmother and hope it isn't too bright for her. The main blue color is dark navy and the flowers are very bright colors!
4.0,I ordered these because I was sore for days after just 30-minute cycle class. I loved the workout but hated how it made my rear so sore.  I didnt want to spend alot of money though in case it didnt make a difference.  These are wondeful!! I can cycle more than once a week and not have any bruising or pain from the bikes seat! I enjoy the workout more.  My only complaint is the size..I prob should of went with a small but I stuck to the size chart. They are a little big and go high up on the waist but they still work and fit pretty good.  Definately recommend these bc they work great and wont break the bank like some other bike shorts will.
4.0,But I like
4.0,a bit too pricey
4.0,For the cost it was just fine. The hoops tend to move up a bit when wearing and if you‚Äôre not careful you‚Äôll need to thread the belt back through (which I did when my daughter wasn‚Äôt being careful and separated them) but they did their job and like I said for the cost I was actually happy.
4.0,The top of the sock seems to roll down to the ankle
4.0,"This was a super soft and comfortable shirt.  Only issue is it won't sit at tunic length naturally it keeps creeping up and being at an odd length but it drapes great, if only it was a bit longer so it would sit at tunic length while moving around and not having to pull it down and having it drape, this would have been a perfect fit.  I do have a long torso so this is usually an issue for me anyway but I am otherwise pretty average body type not super small in any area and not large in any area.  I ordered a size up than what I would normally wear based on the other reviews. I will probably get quite a few wears out of it though, because it is so soft and comfortable.  I bought the shirt at a discount in exchange of my honest and unbiased review, which is exactly what I gave.  That being said,  I am going to buy another one because its so comfortable, if you're on the fence go ahead, but I recommend ordering up a size. If you have a long torso and want length AND drape as pictured, order up two sizes."
4.0,Not great as pictures. Was little off color than expected. Overall quality is good.
4.0,"Nice shirts for the price but they‚Äôre fitted and run way too small. My daughter is only 4‚Äô8, 76lbs, and didn‚Äôt fit the 14/16"
4.0,"I love the look of this bag! It's really beautifully crafted. It's fairly heavy and the leather is a bit stiff,  but I knew the bag was going to be slightly heavy on it's own before adding my things."
4.0,They are awful yet I LOVE them
4.0,Really narrow but awesome and great price
4.0,these are comfy yet a little on the tighter size of large compared to other vendors of similar design. i would buy again just next time a size up for my personnel preference.
4.0,Can fit up to adult size M
4.0,Pretty. Well made and my grandson will love the.
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for, it is very cute but bigger then I wanted, first shipment got lost and they sent a new one right away."
4.0,"I love this piece and fit very well with my steampunk costume.  I would of given this 5 stars but upon my 1st wear the button clasps had one side come out/unglued.  So after 1st wear needed to repair with some glue, but has held up since then.  Great feel and material."
4.0,"Bigger, in height size, than I anticipated. Otherwise no real complaints."
4.0,Cute is the word.  Only wish they were a little bigger in size.
4.0,"Very durable, lovely colour. Ive had it for about 2 years and just now the zipper has spoiled but lovely bag"
4.0,"Very cute, but VERY small. Wouldn't buy for a child older than 6."
4.0,"I am so impressed with these straps. They are fantastic! My measurements are 34-29-33 and these fit great! I went with the small since I'm 5'3&#34;.  Everything is super adjustable and the quality is ridiculously good. Some other reviews were saying you need to reinforce parts, but I couldn't tell you where that's needed.<br /><br />Give yourself at least an hour to get these on the first time, or try putting them on someone else.<br /><br />Four stars because the leg parts seem to fit on or below my kneecap, which causes the straps to bend a bit odd in some places, but it's fine. I can't size up because then it wouldn't fit at all. But that's it for complaints!<br /><br />Buy this!"
4.0,Nice heavy duty chain.  A little bigger than I expected.  I planned to hang a pendant from it but it is not really meant for that.
4.0,This is a very pretty watch and it keeps good time. The unfortunate part is the band. I had a hard time getting it adjusted properly and it does not latch firmly. It comes loose and has falls off easily.
4.0,"The pajamas were really nice, but just bigger than I had expected."
4.0,"Sexy bottom. Would like if it was offered in more colors. Only complaint is the color (red) bleeds in the washer, so it should be washed separately."
4.0,I love lapis and wanted a bracelet I could wear to work and for casual wear. This bracelet works fine for that. A good bargin for the price.
4.0,"Inexpensive way to dress up a blouse of dress.  This belt is a little thicker than it looks in the picture, but still a stylish way to add interest to an outfit."
4.0,Great fit and warm üëå
4.0,"The class didn‚Äôt work on one but they replaced it. Overall these are really nicely made big umbrellas. They don‚Äôt feel cheap or lightweight. However, I had a problem twice with the clasp. that holds it open not working. The company was easy to work with though, and they sent me replacements"
4.0,Nice dress.  Fits well.
4.0,These are so cute; a tad flimsy but they were very inexpensive.
4.0,4 stars given because product quality is great but it runs really small
4.0,"Nice looking, good quality, compact. Just fits the Samsung Galaxy Alpha with TPU case on."
4.0,Very nice. Kind of feels like ‚Äúsatin‚Äù.<br />Very long though.. I expected to be a little above the knees but it goes a bit below... doesn‚Äôt look bad though.
4.0,Fits well nice looking
4.0,Okay but was to small
4.0,"Super cute and due to the zipper, you can show as much skin as you'd like.  Paired with leggings and boots, Amazing!"
4.0,It's fine just a little bigger than I won't do but is ok
4.0,Looks like the photo.  I didn't like it for me though
4.0,The outfit was cute. Bought it for a 10 year old due to her height.  So it didn't fit exactly right as it is meant for an adult woman.  This was fixed with a white short sleeve cotton t shirt.  The leggings were a challenge as one was impossible to keep up.  The elastic should have been tighter.  She loved it so it was a success.
4.0,"Very see through (above the lace) so unfortunately it will not be for pictures like I had purchased for, but it is cute and will make a good beach dress or cover up."
4.0,"Very good buy, it looks and fits nicely. I like the colors, I would recommend purchasing it."
4.0,I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the pins and how quickly I received them.  I will use them as gifts!  I WISH I could order more than 5 per order!!!
4.0,"This was a hit at Christmas. I had to apologize to my mom because my dad wears them in public now.<br /><br />Are they a high quality product? No... they‚Äôre probably what you‚Äôd expect for sandal novelty socks. But let‚Äôs be honest...who is buying these for the high quality? If you‚Äôre considering buying, do it. You won‚Äôt regret it (though your mother might!)"
4.0,Very satisfied! Very roomy. Probably could've ordered a smaller size.
4.0,Nice boots and the shoe portion fits well but I wish they were tighter on my thighs.  They're loose in that area and the constantly slide down.
4.0,Fits easy doesn't ride up especially due to wide hips
4.0,Not a ton of support but good for a normal workout but not running.
4.0,I really like it!  just needed 1 size up
4.0,"I love the material and the was the sleeves flow, however the bust is a little small for women who carry big coconuts... if you catch my drift. Other than that no complaints"
4.0,"I really wanted to like this more because its a good shirt, very soft and comfy but if you can tell from the pictures, it already looks worn out and I've only worn it twice, it hasn't even gone in the wash and already I can tell it will not last me long."
4.0,"Bag was a little smaller than I was expecting, but it's perfect for a high school girl to carry all her things."
4.0,"Nice fabric, but not much room for stretch at the chest yet"
4.0,"Very nice piece of footwear. Good quality material, but a little to short for me. Otherwise they look very sexy on your legs-worth to buy"
4.0,I was impressed with this set of bands because I've tried other ones that didn't fit well or at all. Fits my galaxy 4 watch perfectly. It came packaged well and included 4 sets of different pin sizes. Bands were easy to install and switch out except sometimes the plastic part that holds the pin isnt fully cleanly cut so you do have to push or cut through yourself the first time but it's no big deal - like most girlsüòâ. The fabric feels silky and is comfortable to wear. I have tiny wrists and ordered the small and it still moves around on me a bit but a smaller circumference might not allow me to put it on at all so is my plight lol. Does look cute on and I'm happy with it. Recommend!
4.0,I have bought your other copper fit before and these are pretty good support
4.0,Nice little dress. Worked perfectly for the occassion. It's a little longer on my daugher (age 13) than it appears on this model.
4.0,"These are a skin-tight fit until the legs. If you want a slightly looser fit, go up a size. When I took them out of the package, I thought there was no way I would fit, but they do stretch. I thought I had ordered a child size, but I can wear them."
4.0,"Fit snug, a little thicker than what I was expecting after reading the reviews, but the slightly smaller size helped with the fit in the shoe. Great water drainage."
4.0,"I'm really into large, bold  rings and this one did not disappoint, which is why I bought it in both gold and silver!  The fit was a little large, so I added a ring guard to it and that was all I needed.  If I ordered another from this company, i would order a size smaller than I usually wear. It goes well with all my gold jewelry."
4.0,Good easy care shirt. Better fit than what I purchased before. Irons well and looks like a quality dress shirt. Good buy. And I'm extremely picky about my dress shirts.
4.0,Took too long to get here but it's the only hat aware now
4.0,good tie has a nice feel to it
4.0,Going to be great in the hot Houston summers
4.0,"This is a very classy bag, and just the right size. The only minor complaint I have is that it tips over easily and the buckles are a little difficult to work with."
4.0,"Adorable and good quality... served its purpose. Well, would‚Äôve if coronageddon didn‚Äôt happen -_- but it‚Äôs good to have for next St Paddy‚Äôs!"
4.0,"Lovely casual top, enough room for comfort, enough style to feel good, enough coverage for confidence, and the price is so right.  Love the prints!"
4.0,"Great price, but really thin, wrinkled (and hard to get unwrinkled) and didn't fit very well. Very lose, but I needed a suit this color and fast and it was just what I needed. If you're in a pinch, it's great. If you're looking for quality and great fit, not right for you. I'd look into paying more."
4.0,Good fit flare dress. Love it for Ballroom dancing.  üíÉüíÉ
4.0,I really like the way it feels and the value is really good. I just felt that it fit a little too tight for the size I ordered. I will not return in hope that I can make it work.
4.0,"Cute little flip flops, flower on one came a little smashed to one side but hopefully will fall back in place over time. My daughter wears size 6, got the 5/6 and those fit with almost no extra room."
4.0,"I would definitely recommend going a size up, it‚Äôs great quality keeps him warm but the arms are a little short and so is the bottom so for a more comfortable fit I‚Äôd say size up for sure. Overall great though"
4.0,Good buy for $20.
4.0,Great dress for the price. Material not that great but what do you expect for 33$?! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ I'm 5'8 and 152lbs I got a M and it fit great!
4.0,My son purchased these & he loves them
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and weigh 190 and a 38DD.. My body is curvy but awkward and hard to fit. I purchased the XL based off the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric is good quality, even with how short i am the train wasn‚Äôt too long although i did wear 2 inch heel. I got so many compliments. My only cautions are the same ones I‚Äôve read in other reviews. The zipper was broken when it arrived and i definitely could not have gone braless. You have to have a good strapless bra if you are well endowed as well as shape wear if you are thick. I ended up safety pinning the dress to my bra just to keep it in place so I didn‚Äôt have to worry. This was a good call because with the side arm sleeves it leaves a lot of room for slippage. I don‚Äôt know when I have felt more beautiful though. I recommend this dress 200%."
4.0,"These had a little bit of an odor to them, kinda musty but not too bad. Unfortunately I have found that these are too long for my short neck. I had issue with another pair so I gave these a vigorous shake before trying them on so the fibers wouldn‚Äôt irritate my eyes. These are my favorite colors so I‚Äôm bummed the earrings are too long for me."
4.0,Breathable! Classy!
4.0,"This is the perfect dress, it is very flattering and fits me perfect.  I received a lot of compliments when I wore it to work which made me order another color. BTW the price is just right!"
4.0,"These shoes are ok, we needed a pair of hiking boots for the kids and considering the raving reviews I decided to try these out. They‚Äôre nice looking, pretty water resistant but kids report not as comfortable as other shoes but main complaint is that the sole isn‚Äôt very thick. So, when hiking on rocky terrain, my kid said her feet hurt from the rocks which she doesn‚Äôt have when hiking in sneakers or her previous (sorrel) hiking shoes. Probably great for streetwear, less so if you are looking for proper hiking shoes (which may not be surprising considering the price point)."
4.0,"Wife liked it, easy on and easy off"
4.0,"First, the material is fantastic! Super soft and stretchy so they're perfect for lounging. I got a medium, which is the size I typically wear in this cut of panty, and they fit pretty well. I don't like to wear them while working out or plan on getting sweaty, even though this seems like it would be the right material--they hold on to moisture like crazy. I also feel like you have to be extra careful when washing them or they'll start to fall apart, I've been hand washing mine and they're holding up very well after multiple uses/washes. Overall, they're pretty good if you're in need of some lounge panties"
4.0,Order 1 size larger than you normally wear.
4.0,"Dress is very cute! A little large Under arms, so need a couple alterations"
4.0,This is my favorite cover up.  It is pretty thin and care tear was easily.  I will probably order a new one next year.
4.0,Crosses look sturdy/ prefer no image.
4.0,"This is good for her going over to her friends' houses or meeting up in town. Holds her phone, sunscreen, small wallet or cards, small (8oz) water bottle. Not much more.  A fancier leather purse seems too sophisticated for her at this age. This is a good casual middle ground. In the picture it looked to me like there is a zipper at the top and one on the side, plus a slot on the side. Note that there is NOT a zipper at the top. The zipper you see on the side is the ONLY entry point for the purse. (Plus the slot on the side, which is its own compartment and doesn't zip or snap)."
4.0,"Cute top but, the color is mostly RED than blue, purple, etc. as pictured on Amazon's site. I would rather have gotten those colors instead of so much red..."
4.0,I ordered 3 different sizes.  And finally the largest one fit.  Looks nice.
4.0,"The top fit really good, especially with the off the shoulder strap. I was afraid that it would have been too tight and I would not be able to move my arms but that wasn't the case. I'm a 32b for reference and the smallest size was good. The bottoms however were a little snug because they don't stretch that much. I was still able to wear them but I wished they would have been a smidge bigger."
4.0,Go on easy and looks great
4.0,"I thought this watch band was really pretty and easy to change the size of. I really wanted it to work, but unfortunately, my wrist was in between link sizes, so I had to return it."
4.0,"Perfect for working out, work, and church."
4.0,The item did not come from Walter Drake but from Miles Kimball.  It has taken some time to get used to wearing it even though it is soft siiicone.  I just wish that it would give much better relief than it does.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 135 lbs I ordered a small and it was perfect. The fabric doesn‚Äôt look the same as in the pic, it‚Äôs a bit see through from the front so a bra or pasties are needed."
4.0,I bought it for my friend who recently got a baby girl. I pictured the pink background and cactus pattern fits her very well.  I like it in general.
4.0,"Haven't worn it yet, but it looks pretty cool."
4.0,Love this bag. Just wish the bottom had a sturdy piece in it so it could stand on its own.
4.0,Smaller than others on the sides and very long on the front. Material is great. Hair fall right off of it.
4.0,These sunglasses are amazing. I have  large face and they have a great fit. This is my 3rd pair.
4.0,"These ski goggles are not exactly what I was expecting but they are still great. As you see from most of the reviews, the are very large. This is not necessarily  a bad thing, it just depends on what style you like. I personally think they go great with the new ski helmet I purchased. They seem rather durable for a lower priced pair of goggles. If they do not last long I will update my review. I like the blacked out look as well. Looks great while skiing down a snowy slope."
4.0,"I loved this onesie! I wore it to a show at Red Rocks. It was pretty warm out before the sun went down and it was perfect to tie around my waist with a shirt underneath. I put it on all the way when i got cold at the end of the night. It‚Äôs quite honestly the perfect material. It‚Äôs super soft to keep you cozy but not crazy hot! The horn on the head actually stands up by itself, too! I don‚Äôt have any complaints other than the small hole in the seam near the pocket."
4.0,"This is a lovely shirt. The material is thin, so if modesty is a concern, it'll need something under it. The neck also shows cleavage if something isn't worn under it. I normally go for a large these days for a looser fit, but I gave this medium a try, since another shirt from Wild Hazel I tried was a bit on the large side. While this medium does give me a loose and flowy fit(to the point I worry it looks like a maternity shirt), I do think I'd have been happier with a large based on the top part. It's more fitting there, but the arms and bottom are much more flowy. I'd recommend going with your regular size.<br /><br />It's also a bit brighter in person than I anticipated, so it's more of a statement piece than I typically wear out. The picture shows gold as the flower color and elephant accents. Mine has bright pink instead. The gold would have been more fitting for my personality, I believe. I wear it around my house on those in between days(not too hot, but not too cool), though. It has an airy feel to it."
4.0,"Nice color, appears too small for a man's head, adjustments minimal."
4.0,"Just a little tight around the arms.  Wore this to church last Sunday with a tank top underneath to hide the cleavage, I looked amazing, now I am not a fan of splits in my dresses or skirts and this dress has splits on both sides.  The splits were not bad at all and the colors are vibrant.  I really like this dress."
4.0,"Great! A bit tight, but I'm a bigger girl and expected that. It'd be nice if they could fit better."
4.0,"The look and feel of these slippers is quite acceptable, but they lack sufficient footbed padding.  I will see how they wear and possibly revise this review."
4.0,"Cute outfit, fit my granddaughter just fine"
4.0,"Beautiful design and lovely soft fabric.  The fit is a little off though.  I ordered a large, and while the product does fit, it is an awkward fit.  The waist sits too low on me, and the back gaps out.  For reference I am 5'1&#34;, 140lbs, 36B, with a very round bum.  So it's not like I am some tall amazon woman.  It feels like this was made for someone with much smaller proportions.  The top is very pretty but does not offer any support, so this would probably not be good for a woman with a larger bust.  But, despite this, I will still wear the piece, and my boyfriend finds it very pretty also!  Just wish it fit a little better!"
4.0,Good .but then gold silver is more beautiful
4.0,"I am 5'4 and currently 140lbs. I bought a medium and it fits snuggly around the chest. This dress is so pretty, I look adorable in it. Excellent dress!"
4.0,Bought this for my daughter.  Fits as expected.  Very cute. The top seems more durable than the bottoms. I would recommend.
4.0,"The chain is well made, approximately 6mm thick. It is sturdy, a little heavy with a good clasp. I like it. Quality and workmanship are good. The finish is nice and shines. Will be purchasing another chain from Beststeel Jewelry within the next serval weeks."
4.0,"So cute! I bought this after buying the same one in black and light blue, but was a little disappointed to find out that it doesn't have the built-in slip underneath like the black and blue ones did. Make sure you wear something you wouldn't be embarrassed to show off underneath, because it's a tad see through. I love the stitching and the look of this skirt, plus it's long enough to wear to work. The bottom of the skirt has a weird little flare like it doesn't properly fit around my legs, but it looks like it was intentional. Cute skirt for a not-so-bad price!"
4.0,I am a watch collector and have seen many straps. IMO this product is a good quality strap. The buckle however can be improved. All in all it is worth the price.
4.0,Ordered black but it looks navy blue I guess because of the white small dots. Overall happy with the fit.
4.0,Won't wear till spring
4.0,I ordered this for my husband who has a huge wrist and it was smaller than the standard Apple band ... of your looking for a replacement than it‚Äôs just as good as the Apple brand but not larger
4.0,"I got the two pack, one for myself and for my partner. Check the screw in pieces when you get them and it only comes with 6 dividers. One of the screw in pieces didn't have the grooves to screw in but my partner didn't need theirs so I would have had an extra one anyway. It definitely cut down on the constant clink of my keys. I used the bottle cap looking attachment for my partners car fob so that's the only piece that sticks out."
4.0,Good belts. The buckle is plastic but it seems pretty durable. Great buy for the price. Fast Shipping
4.0,perfect size! I am making hair jewels and I LOVE them!
4.0,Easy to put on Light weight for summer and love the cool colors.
4.0,Super comfy and perfect for summer.
4.0,"Adorable glasses, lightweight."
4.0,El palito se dobla con facilidad ;  pero el dise√±o me encant√≥!!!*
4.0,This was a gift for someone on their luck.<br />It served the intent.
4.0,"The dark blue color is beautifully set off by the silver arms, which has minimalist branding - I hate the ones that have giant logos on the sides! The pop of blue tortoiseshell for the ear bumpers make me happy, even though no one else would ever see it.<br /><br />The optometrist was very complementary of the high quality of these frames when I brought them in to be filled. They are a bit deeper than I've worn in the past decade or so, but this had been recommended to me because it allows the progressive prescription more room for subtle changes, and I won't spend as much time cocking my head up and down to access the sweet spot.<br /><br />The nose pads are soft silicone rather than hard plastic, which means that you don't have the constant slippage down you nose from heavy lenses.<br /><br />I have noticed that I do have to keep tabs on the screws holding the lenses in - they tend to loosen over the course of a week or so - be sure to keep your tiny screwdriver handy for tightening up again. It's a small knock for an otherwise great pair of frames."
4.0,"I bought for my small 12 year old, fits how I expected. Cute on she doesn‚Äôt like scratchy things and she loves this so it must be ok."
4.0,"I got this for riding on those crisp winter mornings, which in California are in the 45-55 degree range. It works to keep the head from getting too chilly, and it fits under the helmet better than a typical cycling cap. It also extends over the ears which is very nice.<br /><br />If you're riding in the dead of winter in Minnesota, this won't be enough. But for warmer locations or in the autumn and spring, this is a really helpful bit of kit. Oh, and it packs up small for when it warms up."
4.0,"Good materials, not flimsy.  More importantly, my granddaughter loves how she looks in it... which is &#34;very, very cute&#34;"
4.0,This is a lovely blue pendant. The blue stone looks to be good quality.  The metal parts looks like sterling silver though it's not  but it looks very good.  I think it's well made and should last a long time.  Had it been a little bit heavier and the chain a little bit longer I would have given it 5 stars.  It hangs like a medium length necklace and does not hang low.  It's very pretty though and I look forward to wearing it often.
4.0,"thinner than snoozies, but great for the cost"
4.0,I ordered a size up from what I usually wear. It fit great. Good quality for the price and flattering cut. It looks just like the pictures. It is a very dark blue.
4.0,Love the shoes and my son was so happy to get these! He calls them his party shoes and rhey fit great. Wish they would have sent 2 chargers to charge both shoes at once and one ahoe was super squished in the box. But it eventually evened out after wearing.  My son says they are the most comfortable shoes he has. We ordered a size 10 and my son is 3.
4.0,"A bit tight on the arms and accentuates every curve on your body,a little too tight for me but overall a beautiful dress!"
4.0,This ring looks real. It is a beautiful ring. Very elegant. Good quality!
4.0,I am M but I bougth XXL and it is fit
4.0,Great as long as you don't dry them-they shrink when dried!
4.0,"These are fun and pretty for casual wear, though the mix of red and silver are not really as shown.  There's very little silver so they look more solid in color...still, a nice splash of color for earrings."
4.0,The bezels were just what I was looking for. The only complaint I have to make is that they did not come with a loop to put a chain through. I had to find a couple and put them on myself.
4.0,SHE LIKED IT
4.0,It was missing a piece of the suit near the stomach area...
4.0,"Good value, quality"
4.0,Runs big. I‚Äôm usually a medium but had quite a bit of extra fabric around my waist. The design is cute so I‚Äôm considering reordering a small to see if the fit is better.
4.0,The watch itself if great. However the ring on top and the chain feel cheap.
4.0,It is a nice and roomy bag with large pockets on the ends. The embroidery on the front of the bag is really cute  Just wish there were a couple of pockets on the inside of the bag as well.
4.0,Felt that the top was a little too short for me . Material is super soft and the pockets are a plus
4.0,"My daughter, at 10, tends to find kids masks too small, but adult masks too big. I like the adjusters on these to shorten the ear straps. They work pretty well for her. They are two layers of mid weight polyester or blend, not sure - soft and slick - with the filter pocket essentially serving as a third layer in the center. The filters themselves are so thick that they flatten out the pleats, which isn't great on a small face. I might see if cutting out and inserting a piece of a disposable, mask works better. I'm disappointed that the filter pocket is only sewn on the top and bottom - seems like the filter could slide out, but if I machine sew a third side it'll mess up the front design. Overall it's a decent product for the price, and nice designs."
4.0,Able to put on and take off w/o having to get my wife to help me<br />Very comfortable
4.0,"Like product concept, but it offers no support."
4.0,"First off, the top on the model in this listing is not an accurate representation of what this Women's Summer Sleeveless Scoop Neck Tank Tops looks like. Now, the photos in the listing that are laying down are.<br /><br />This tank is of a pretty good quality and be a cute basic for summertime or even an under short for Sweaters, blazers, or cardigans and the little stones do add a cute touch. I love the green color!<br /><br />For reference I'm a 38D and 5'5 and this tank fit perfectly with a little room!<br /><br />I do recommend, but really did like the look of the model pic"
4.0,"Cute earrings, but I cannot wear them with everything"
4.0,Eh too thick üòÇ
4.0,"Very comfortable, in my opinion there should be more holes in the strap. Over time the leather will stretch and the straps will have to be adjusted. I can make new holes, but why not anticipate this need. Seem to be of good quality."
4.0,"The only thing I dislike is the supplied chain. Other than that,  it's a nice wallet."
4.0,Pretty good quality sweatshirt.  I like it.
4.0,The hat was great but it came all smushed in a box so it had wrinkles and folds and the top was smushed down.
4.0,"This top was a little on the large side but not bad enough to return. The fabric seems a little cheap and there were a lot of strings at the seams. Again, it was so inexpensive so I'm not going to return it. For the price its just fine."
4.0,Works fine in polishing up silver stuff.
4.0,"Not as large as other reviews said. I have small hands and ordered these for a tight fit as I hate loose gloves.  I‚Äôve discovered, they are definitely for children üôÉ I wasted money taking a chance."
4.0,"They're exactly as advertised and will do what I want. Keep my shooting/safety glasses from being easily scratched or damaged while banging around in my range bag. Had a pair break even though they were in a separate zippered pocket, so this will provide extra protection for them. The glasses I ordered (Radians) fit well. While the case isn't as stout as some, and the lid will compress a bit at the zipper, if your glasses aren't overly large the case should do a reasonable job of keeping contents safe. Good price, and good service."
4.0,The train is a little long for my likings but my daughter absolutely loves it so that‚Äôs really all that matters fit her great tho
4.0,Comfortable odd to zip zippe backwards
4.0,The back of the underwear is too big. This is supposed to be a recommendation since the product that I was looking for is no longer available.
4.0,"The material and feel awesome, I could have ordered a smaller size!  But, I am still wearing it"
4.0,Don't really dislike anything about the jacket
4.0,fixed my vita no more low battery warnings with full charge.
4.0,Est√° bien pero ese corte de la parte de arriba no me agrad√≥ mucho q digamos
4.0,Comfy material but ran very big. I also bought the hot pink from Saraswim in large and it was too small. I prefer the look of the Saraswim. Much more expensive looking.
4.0,Great deal for the money but these need a lot of work before they're worn! Definitely needs a chin strap and all 4 were mis shaped when arrived. Great for what I needed though!
4.0,"It is pretty, but it is obviously &#34;homemade&#34; as in there isn't even a tag in it and you can tell by the thread/stitching. Also, even though it's two layers it is still fairly sheer. It is long and flowy and the print as pictured."
4.0,"Nice quality and super cute.  Sadly, it was on the small side and I had to return."
4.0,"I got them for a costume and was a wise choice. They fit well we‚Äôre super comfy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 5‚Äù long legs. 34 hip, 37 full hip and a 34‚Äù inseam. They were shorter than I would have like. Came up a couple inches above my ankles which I wasn‚Äôt to happy with. It fit snuggly on my legs but was still had a lot of stretch. Thick material."
4.0,Just what i need for my hair. Right length and width.
4.0,"Like the color, sleeves that roll are nice. Cute with leggings and boots. Few threads came out with washing, may be better to dry clean. I wear with a scarf because the zipper in front feels big. Fabric lays nicer with a cami underneath. Would buy again"
4.0,"Space in the main area is a little tight once you put a pair of sneakers (size 9.5 for me) in their special compartment, but otherwise a nice compact and sturdy gym bag!"
4.0,Runs a little small. Bought a 3T for my tiny 3 year old and it fits small...and short. But she still loves it. Not the best material either but she doesn‚Äôt mind
4.0,"ALoveSoul  Inspirational Expandable Bangle Bracelet, is nicely made, has great quotes, and is half the price of &#34;other&#34; popular wired bracelets.<br />I purchased this bracelet for my daughter, to inspire her on a daily bases. I purchased the bracelet with the quote... &#34;She believed she could so she did&#34;.<br /><br />The bracelet is a shiny Alloy, similar to Silver. So far I've seen no tarnishing on the bracelet, no discoloring on the skin, and no problems with adjusting the bracelet. The adjusting of the bracelet is a great feature, being your able to slightly contract, or expand the bracelet to fit smaller or slightly larger wrists. Expanding the bracelet is easy. You simply either, squeeze both sides of the bracelet slowly, and slightly, or expand by pulling both sides out. You just don't want to overdo the expand/contract of the bracelet, so as not to change the initial form.<br />The charm is nicely worded, and the font is large enough to be read, or seen at arms length.<br />I made sure to tell my daughter to try not to get the bracelet wet, and not to use when using suntan lotion, or other lotions, unless they dry completely. From my past experiences, certain metals have a reaction to exposure of lotions, or liquid, that tends to tarnish the metal.<br /><br />Overall, a fun, inspirational bracelet that my daughter loves, and that makes this Mom of a pre-teen happy...  I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinions are solely my own and are based on my overall use and satisfaction of the product. Any questions, please feel free to ask, and I will try and answer them. Let me know if you approve/disapprove of my review by clicking yes/no below."
4.0,Received four compliments on this tie the first day I wore it! One was from a menswear salesman in the department store where I work part-time. My only concern with this tie is that it feels rather stiff instead of &#34;smushy.&#34;
4.0,"Fun hats, good quality. But they are very oval, not head shaped and they don't form to your head. We wore them to Burning Man with goggles on them and had a fun look."
4.0,"Good idea for the modern age but it does depend on the person who has your luggage being willing and able to either scan the QR code or go to the web address on the tag. The web address is relatively short and simple which is a plus. When I tested it, it sent me to a very useful contact information page for my luggage including a photo of the luggage itself.<br /><br />My only complaint is how this is marketed. It is implied that the device itself can use GPS tracking to find your lost item It can't. It is implied that the tag itself has ample storage. It has none. At best, it's a little misleading. The description reads:<br /><br />FROM THEIR WEB SITE **** A dynotag is an advanced Web-enabled, GPS assisted QR Smart Tag that can be read using a smartphone or a computer. NO batteries or moving parts. Easy to use, the dynotag instantly displays any information you, its owner, wants to share such as contact information, medical information, documents, photos, recordings. Ample storage for your information included on the dynotag, and you can easily update your information at ANY time using a web browser.<br /><br />I think the company needs to be clearer about what this is and/or stop using misleading language. It's a tag with a QR code that directs people to a web site containing identification info and some GPS location info if the person decides to allow the browser/phone to share it. The tag itself has no storage or GPS functionality.<br /><br />Still a good idea. I'm glad I bought it. Good supplement to the old school bag tag."
4.0,Love these shoes these are my third pair
4.0,"So this does exactly as advertised, however it pushes up my fat past the tummy control so then I have a weird tire up higher. Haha it was not pretty. It stays up really well while swimming though and it doesnt squeeze too tight on my legs. I'll keep it as my backup suit,  but they arent my favorite bottoms."
4.0,"Super pretty, fits well- comfortable (I personally detached the arm sleeves soI could wear those with our without the dress- It's more comfortable that way too so I can move my arms and also keep it not so tight around my arms.<br /><br />It is thick though- the fabric isn't the best for summer wear- its hot lol"
4.0,It‚Äôs design is so nice! I‚Äôm hoping my hubby loves it! Somehow though I got shipped 2 lanyards and one of them was a Wiz Khalifa lanyard üòÇü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0,It was a gift I gave to someone near and dear. He LOVES IT!!
4.0,Lots of points for comfort. Super soft yoga pants. They make me look pretty great! At 5'2&#34; the legs are much too long for me. I got them hemmed about 2.5 inches and the boot-cut opening feels a little big for my shape. If they offered petite sizes these babies would have 5 stars from me.
4.0,"Bought for a gift, but they are cute and like they said"
4.0,"I like this top, the fabric is flowy but not clingy & I like the colors, which are true to the online picture. I will say it does come out of the dryer with wrinkles but some will fall out when hung up. The sleeves have a small cuff that don‚Äôt go back to the proper fold after being washed & dried. Don‚Äôt dry on high as it will shrink but on low did fine."
4.0,"pretty good quality sweatshirt, like all over Instagram. runs small, i'm female and 5'6 and i had to buy xl so i'm not sure how it'd fit others. other than that, the graphic is nice and it's good for spring/fall weather"
4.0,Like the price. Good materials.
4.0,Really LOVED this dress... just too small in the bust... otherwise nothing wrong. I wish I could have kept it - it fit everywhere but the chest.
4.0,"Beautiful colors,runs small and long"
4.0,Zipper was flimsy. I had to replace. But overall I multiple compliments.
4.0,"Nice kippah made of high quality fabric, but the picture is misleading. This Kippah is not like a Bucharian or well rounded kippah that fits snugly on youtr head. My suggestion is to make an expandable band sown into the rim of the kippah, so that kippahs  like these can stretch to fit snugly on all head sizes. That would be a best selling kippah."
4.0,"These pants looked good, but they were too small.  More of a junior XL.  Length and legs looked good, but waist was too small. I didn't even try on.  I returned, which was quick and easy at Kohls."
4.0,Los uso cuando hace un poco de calor
4.0,"It worked great for my Belle Disneybound, however, it was HUGE on me right out of the bag. I had to be crafty and use paper clips to fold the sides in so that it would be acceptable to wear to Disneyland since I didn‚Äôt have time to do anything else. After washing it, it did shrink considerably and now fits appropriately so I definitely recommend washing and drying before you wear it, especially if you have a small head like me."
4.0,The are very comfortable and tru to size. Did not have to break in. I have received compliments.
4.0,"I love these the only prob I have is that I think these are assembly lined items, they have a place on both sides where the pockets obviously are or were supposed to be for another item..Who knows but, It is obvious when you wear it that it is a pattern of a different kind of dress not the one being sold here.."
4.0,It did it's job. Comfortable. Breathable. No irritation. I wore this mask for about 3 or 4 hours while in a Mardi Gras parade. Worked out much easier than painting my face black.
4.0,"Other than being a little big around the top of dress, I really like it.  I get many compliments on it.  The pockets tend to stick out, wish they weren't there."
4.0,Good summer hat. 2nd favorite of my straw hats. My Panama has a tighter and smaller weave but was considerably more expensive
4.0,I'm loving the necklace it looks like real silver and it looks beautiful with my silver accessories got a lot of compliments :)
4.0,Smaller than expected but still cute. Details in the glass not nearly as visible in person than in photos which is a bummer. But they‚Äôre cute enough I‚Äôll still wear them.
4.0,These socks feel and look great.  they go to your knee which is what I wanted without any struggle.  they are thin so will fit with any shoe or boot.  the only issue is they snag easily.
4.0,Wore this to the Boston Marathon and didn't see ANY other people wearing it!  I got a lot of comments about it.  Love the color/contrast.
4.0,alittle to smll but ok
4.0,She liked it. That's all that matters.
4.0,"too tight, not a great dress"
4.0,Nice gold. I will order a little bit more big size next time.
4.0,"Very low neckline, almost like a V-neck."
4.0,Very substantial hoops.  I wear these a lot.  Love them.
4.0,IF I WOULD KNOWEN FROM CHINA I WOULD HAVE ORDERED A SIZE 4OR 5X  IUSUALLY TAKE 8OR9  BUT FROM CHINA  MUCH LARGER  OTHERWISE I LOVE THEM  THEY HELPP SUPPORT MY BACKAND TUMMY AND ARE COMFORTABLE  I  WILL BUY THM AGAIN
4.0,"So realistic, had gotten so many compliments. Was even decently comfy for a Halloween costume."
4.0,"These have lasted pretty well. After 4 months rotating through the three pair, one of the wooden pieces has come loose from the metal threaded bit. For the price I have no complaints."
4.0,This is super cute! But also super super big. I wear a size L or XL and it was like...so big. Like I wanna try to take it in a little? So if you‚Äôre tiny idk if this is gonna do the trick for you.
4.0,I can't wait to wear at the beach!
4.0,Nice looking. Speedy service. As represented in product description
4.0,Ordered a large. I'm 175lb and 5'3 it fits nicely.
4.0,"It did what I needed it to do for a galantines day brunch. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 185 lbs. Ordered lrg."
4.0,Well made strap and it stays on.
4.0,"Nice quality, slimmer fitting than I anticipated."
4.0,These are well made. They metal does not hurt my ears. I could wear them for days with no allergic type reaction. The photo shows some turquoise-like veining. Mine were just solid color. I like them.
4.0,The only concern is the sleeves are a little tight. Not bad enough to return.
4.0,"Very good headphones, glad I purchased. Seem tight, even on my 3 year old's head, but other than that, he loves wearing them, and they made a huge difference for him. He can go to noisy locations now without a problem."
4.0,A gift for a friends kid they fit for now but there is no adjustment on them when he grows a little more won‚Äôt work for him but maybe this summer
4.0,Always looking to shed more in the summer and this works for me nice fit
4.0,"My son found this in a shop for $50. I was able to handle it in person and tell that it was cheaply made, and I wasn‚Äôt going to pay that much for it, but he desperately wanted it. I was pleased to find it here for a little more than half the price, so I ordered it for him. It is exactly the same as the one he saw in a shop. I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to keep anyone warm, but it‚Äôs more of an accessory to express one‚Äôs  Demon Slayer fandom. It is not good quality, and it definitely runs small. I ordered an XL when he usually wears a medium in US men‚Äôs sizes."
4.0,I love these shades and they way they look! The mirror lenses look awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they are VERY dark. I guess they're good for a REALLY sunny day though!
4.0,Cute little gift for someone special.
4.0,I don‚Äôt absolutely love this product because the necklace was very loose and felt like it was gonna fall off at least the green part and I wasn‚Äôt as very stable and put together as you may think.
4.0,Great shoe but the inside lining literally made my feet sweat.  I don't want my feet to sweat so I returned them.  Now my feet don't sweat.  I don't like it when my feet sweat.  I never let my feet sweat.  Feet sweat
4.0,Fits in waist but too Short for someone tall. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9. Too short
4.0,"This is an ingenious idea! Only two of then will buckle tho! The other two will not snap. I‚Äôm really enjoying the two that do snap, they do a great job of making the waistband fit better!"
4.0,I got these for myself and my mom and daughter for a trip to Paris in January. They are beautiful and look great. I was surprised that my fingertips still got cold in 35 degree weather though but maybe that is normal.
4.0,This watch makes a prefect give. Lovely
4.0,"I got this watch for my nephew, but i think i will keep it for my self. It is very nice and the price was even nicer. $18.0"
4.0,Nice blouse and I didn't have to spend hours (and a lot of money) searching a brick & morter store!
4.0,I love this sweater. The only thing I don't like is that it runs big. I got a small and could have easily fit into an extra small.
4.0,"It came early so that's good but I did find the sweater itself a lot bigger on the upper sleeves. The printing is also a bit flaky towards the zipper. Overall, good."
4.0,Good color and the end of the wire is filed and rounded.
4.0,Its a very cute dress and it came just in time!
4.0,It's a nice necklace but it didn't come in the size that I ordered
4.0,"Loved this costume!  Some people didn‚Äôt know it was a birthday cake, which surprised me, but the top fit great and the bottom went on easily over the head or over the hips.  Only problem was it doesn‚Äôt stay completely round."
4.0,Fun t-shirt but rather pricey.
4.0,"This is the third order I've placed for these cooling bandanas. There are crystals inside the bandana and soaking them in a pail of water makes them puff up then you just tie around your neck. The guys who have worked on our house always appreciated the bandanas I provided for them, especially when the weather  is hot outside. I think all companies who have contractors working for them should have these for their employees. One worker told me he couldn't believe they didn't drip when he used them .  Great for anyone mowing their lawn on a hot day should use them too.<br />I give these out for free as the price is not high when buying 12 or more on Amazon."
4.0,Liked it. Price can be more competitive. Looks good
4.0,"I ordered the dress in royal blue and overall it fits very well. My only critique is there is a fair amount of material for the bottom half of the dress. It's not heavy at all, but for someone petite as myself there is too much material. However, it still looked great, it's comfortable and flattering and I received many nice compliments on it."
4.0,"I purchased XXL although my US size is L. I read reviews and also found a size chart see for this and similar products -see below. It makes sense why many people ordered and found it to be too small. Because you need to go by 2 sizes up. Just use the chart. The coat seems to be an a cheap side and I would prefer a nice liner (looks like the liner is the same as outside fabric), but I like the design and that it is light. In general, it is a comfortable, light, and warm coat. Have decided to keep it.<br />Size Table:<br />Us Size<br />(type): S M L XL<br />Our Size<br />(tag size): L XL XXL XXXL"
4.0,Good buy. i wear large in clothing and i bought small in the belt. that's how much stretch it has. really good
4.0,"My first amazon clothing purchase and I was pleasantly surprised. Fabric was thick and comfortable. Dress fit perfectly, no weird loose pieces or anything like that. My only qualm is that the skirt is somewhat see through. You will need a slip with this one."
4.0,I liked the quality of this tie.  I color was less vibrant in person. But the likeness was close.  I would recommend this tie to anyone that needs a silk tie for less.
4.0,Cute but be aware the size 8 runs small. It fit more like a size 6.
4.0,Pretty good. do not appear to be available in Australia so they must be a must have.
4.0,Fun for game day
4.0,"Very light, soft and comfortable."
4.0,"I love the style and the lettering in the  back. Neulus makes some great great quality items. I own their compression shorts, running pants, now the dry fit shirts.<br /><br />The ONLY con is that I assumed the large would fit more snug. I'm afraid that going to medium might be too small."
4.0,"Comfortable, nicely constructed, very attractive. Just a bit small.  Large is for size 10 to 11.  I wear  a 10 and my toes hit the end of the shoe."
4.0,Just what I expected for the price. Like them!
4.0,I have neuropathy in my hands and arms and these along with the gloves help a lot.
4.0,"These are pretty close to the kind of socks I wanted. The ad said they were cotton, but they obviously have artificial materials besides cotton in them."
4.0,"love the cuff, on of the tips of the feather was bent upward which caused a sharp point, will attempt to bend back into place"
4.0,Love these so cute and comfortable
4.0,"Plastic shield is too short it barely covers the nose area unless you pull the hat all the way down. The plastic is not clear (almost like frost glass) so it‚Äôs hard to see. I detached the visor from the hat to remove the plastic shield and the plastic snap-on broke! Now, I have a hat without a visor. Poor quality. FYI, my now useless visor isn‚Äôt tinted either.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller regarding the issues I was having with the item. They responded to my inquiry very quickly. They shared very helpful information so I could enjoy and use my hat visor properly. I am very happy with the outcome and thankful that the seller was very willing to assist. Thank you AYLISS !!!"
4.0,"The quality is great, and it is still worth owning, but I subtracted one star because this deep red looks more like a deep purple in person. I needed deep red for my bridal party."
4.0,Big but very comfoy
4.0,"you get what you pay for. i got these for decor and they are perfect for that. they are very thin and light shines through easily, but if buying in bulk they are a great purchase"
4.0,Love the look; material could be better. Wish it were lined. Love the fit.
4.0,"This shirt was purchased for my 7 year young grandaughter who loves kitties, tacos, and being unique! ~ this shirt is made well, the fabric is smooth and very soft; and the price was right with all my boxes checked off!"
4.0,"This is my first TwelveLittle bag and I have to say, I'm impressed with the overall quality and design, not to mention the beautiful floral print! It holds pretty much everything I need while I'm out and about with my 4 year old, which includes: a 24-ounce stainless steel water bottle for me; a 12-ounce water bottle for my kid; a JuJuBe large set piece (with mommy needs); a change of clothes; a JJB small set piece (as a mini med kit); small snacks; my wallet (another JJB small set piece); keys, and a couple other small miscellaneous items. For size comparison, it's bigger and much more spacious than the JJB Minibe, and more comfortable to wear, in my opinion.<br /><br />The internal organization in the main section of the bag is useful, and I feel like I can load up the bag without it looking too bulky. The front zip pocket isn't super spacious, but you can fit thinner items in there easily. The hidden pocket in the back comes in handy too - I will often put my wallet in there for safe keeping. The top grab handle is very sturdy and the zippers are super smooth. The straps are padded and pretty comfortable, although I will say, I wish they went down a little lower under my shoulders. When the bag is really heavy, the straps can dig in a little in my armpits.<br /><br />My absolute favorite feature of this bag is that it stands up on its own, even when completely empty! This might seem like a minor thing, but it really annoys me when bags are floppy and slide down or tip over because the bottom isn't flat or wide enough. Whether it's empty, partially full or completely packed up, the bag sits straight up and never tips over, which means you'll easily be able to pack it up or grab whatever you need.<br /><br />There are a couple cons worth noting. I do wish that there were exterior bottle pockets so I wouldn't have to use up space inside the bag for our water bottles. I've also become accustomed to having backpacks that have a zip pocket at the top, near the grab handle. That's always been a good spot for keys, sunglasses and other easy-grab items. I've also only used it this past summer, so I haven't had to worry about bringing extra layers of clothes, which would most likely not fit or else have to be really stuffed in there. But other than that, I'm really happy with this bag and think it's a great mommy backpack for when you've graduated from diapers and potty training needs."
4.0,"A beautiful and inspiring key chain inscribed with the verse: Romans 5:8, ‚ÄúI loved you at your darknest‚Äù. I believe the correct verse would translate to  the word ‚Äúdarkest‚Äù, however, not a significant issue for me. If this was purchased for me to give as a gift, I may recheck the correct phrasing/word, but I understand the content and meaning of the message, so not a big deal. Holds nice amount of keys on the key ring, but the cross is about the same size as my keys, so more a keychain charm; Nonetheless, it‚Äôs beautiful!"
4.0,I'm enjoying them! And they do not make me break out. :)
4.0,"Nice cufflinks, though I think the chrome is a little much. These would have been great if they were a little less shiny or in a pewter finish."
4.0,"Current price - $19.99. Size Large - I typically order everything in a medium but his dress said the medium was size 4-6 and a large was 8-10. There is also a weight factor - I weigh 130 lbs and the weight portion was in-between a large and a medium. I rather error on being too large than too small. So, I ordered the large. The large fits just like I like a beach cover-up to fit. Not tight. The length is good  too. This is something you could wear out for really causal wear but there is nothing fancy about this dress. Just a decent cover-up. 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. I ordered the navy and I'm very happy with this dress."
4.0,The material on the inside wasn‚Äôt sewed together with the outside and the sequins would end up rubbing on my legs.
4.0,"Great quality from MP, Can‚Äôt go wrong with Cordera fabric, can use either the carabiner or velcro Koop in either horizontal or vertical position, wish they had more color choices. Fits an iPhone XS with battery case or a 6+ with pelican case easily. Overall satisfied with purchase, I own almost a dozen of MP products and all get used and abused often but still holds up."
4.0,Great buy soft and was nice and long.<br />Only issue is u do wanna b careful w how u fix the top so hair is well displayed. The bangs r wicked long. I trimmed them = looked great. I got lots of compliments over the wig.I got it for a Xmen costume.<br />If u need to brush it out use your fingers works better. I used some hair oil as well to tame a few flyaways and to undue a few knots.<br />I liked the quality. Stayed on no problem its a white silvery color. Deffintly a head turner.<br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Cant beat the price and I liked the material<br />Looks just like the pic a wavy platinum wig . Incredible length. U cant go wrong w it
4.0,"These gaiters are silky and stretchy, with a serged vertical seam up the back of the tube and hemmed edges at the top and bottom. The blues are just as vibrant as in the pictures, and the whites, greys, and blacks are nice neutrals that go with everything. These are a great choice for sun protection or a headband or bandana, but they are extremely breathable and thus not a good choice for containing respiratory droplets. I can blow out a candle wearing one of these just as easily as I can without any face covering at all, and I can even do so with the gaiter folded to make a double layer."
4.0,"So far so good. Got these to use with my ‚Äúgood‚Äù Maui Jim‚Äôs that I like to wear on beach but can‚Äôt read with (old eyes and all!!). So far these have been perfect. Take some getting used to the bi-focals when walking, etc, but reading has been great. I did have one of the lenses pop off, but fortunately I caught it when it happened. It reapplies with no issues and so far so good, 3 days later. They definitely work as intended."
4.0,"Nice sunglasses and nice case. I've tried four different brands and all are too tight, including these. I'm female with a wide head. I don't know how big-headed men find glasses at all. Anyway, I'm going to razor-shave the arms so they bend out more. This pair is worth the effort."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable fabric, minimum shrinkage. Size runs bi."
4.0,Clasp is a little hard to get used to at first. Sound product.
4.0,"Worth the more,  good swimsuit. Has good bust support"
4.0,"Love the color. It' super cute and comfy. The front hangs a little longer than the back, but not horribly. I plan on wearing it to an upcoming trip to Vegas the first week of October.<br />I am 5'4"" about 140 lbs. I ordered the medium....maybe, maybe could've taken a small."
4.0,"Hmmm.... I was kinda surprised with this dress, it's a nice spring/summer dress but it's not what I expected. The buttons are non-functioning so the whole front of the dress is sewn shut, and the straps are not adjustable so for me to get the dress to sit properly I had to do a little sewing. The length was good just below my knees, the smocking on the back was nice but I'm not sure how long it will hold up, meaning the shape. This isn't the kind where it's gonna shrink back down so if you stretch it out, it's stretched out. The material was a little heavier than I expected, it's good cause it's not see thru but I was something a little nicer."
4.0,THESE ARE SO CUTE! A LITTLE SPENDY FOR RUBBER GLOVES- BUT YOU WILL BE THE TALK OF YOUR KITCHEN ON THANKSGIVING!
4.0,"Runs a little small, even following the size chart. But it was a nice bathing suit, not weird cut or odd like most of the ones I've ordered. Pretty good quality."
4.0,"The dress is very very long and it is short waisted, but I can hem it."
4.0,"The neck does kind of a weird thing, it's perched directly balanced across the top of the sweater instead of being canted a bit to the front like most cowls and mock-turtles. Doesn't stop me from wearing it, I love the length, but I find myself periodically fussing with the neck, trying to &#34;fix&#34; it."
4.0,It looks a little better in the picture but it's still a pretty bag... The quality is okay and I like that it's roomy.
4.0,"Very pretty. Great sparkle.  Big but not too big.  hand a little sideways, wish they faced front a bit more (maybe it's my ears?)  Very pretty. Comes in nice velvet pouch, keeping them in it. Wore for formal event, but can also wear to office."
4.0,Love the look but my feet are wide and they are too narrow for me. Do they come in wide sizes?
4.0,I like turtleneck for layering and this one fits true to size. The neck stands on its own and is not sloppy.
4.0,"arrived on time and comes with the watch tool too. Haven't had a chance to switch straps, but they seem to be quality and the right fit for my weekend knock around watch!"
4.0,"Fits as expected, comfy, stylish"
4.0,very nice shirt. good material. runs a little on the larger side.
4.0,"I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable, but I did add some moleskin to the underside of the straps, since the edges if straps were sharp."
4.0,"Always loved these since my college days. Like anything, quality has gone downhill in those 30+years. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hold a heavy set of keys. The metal ring is not very heavy and loses its shape easily just trying to put simple house keys on it. Great for a quick dash out the door to walk the dog or trip around the block but wouldn‚Äôt trust them for heavy activity over a long period of time."
4.0,Just love the simplicity of this dress!!! Simplebut elegant
4.0,Love this suit. Very attractive and well made which is important for full figures girl. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Cute but I really like a cover-up that is cotton and closer weave.  Want it to keep out the strong Fl sun and breathe! Bought this for Mazalan, Mexico so was OK for there."
4.0,A little to big for me
4.0,If you need a beiny this is your way to go. light wait comfortable. Worth the price and the waight.
4.0,"It is pretty.  It's a bit awkward with the collar, but it is aesthetically pleasing. The drawback for me is the way it feels. It has sort of plasticity feel to it."
4.0,We used them as gifts. Folks liked them. they were easy to fill. A little smaller than i visualized.
4.0,"I bought this for my wife. She loved it. Small and simple, but elegant. Is smaller than I was expecting however."
4.0,These are cute and easy to use. They don‚Äôt hurt my ears so far which is a great thing. The larger sizes are very large lol I used only the small ones for a few holes that I didn‚Äôt have anything in. I also used one in my septum. So far so good!
4.0,Just wished it was a little bigger. If bigger would of given it a 5. Very fast shipping. Excellent packaging. Thank you
4.0,"Very strongly made. Soild, that goes for the spring action too. Very tight. I have yet to wear it. But, I think it will do the job quite well."
4.0,"Very comfortable skirt! It looks exactly like it does in the picture. The fabric is really thin and there's not a slip underneath, but the color and amount of fabric hides it. It's super long on me (I'm 5'5) and I had to have my mom hem it, but once she did that I've been wearing it during the warmer months of the summer! I've received numerous compliments on it!"
4.0,This seems very well made. The Velcro is very strong . I myself have worn this daily and it does make my midsection sweat. Haven‚Äôt actually experienced any belly fat changes yet though but I am hopeful. I am a senior so I‚Äôm pretty sure more youthful people get faster and better results. Still believe this does what it should.
4.0,love this bag with jeans!
4.0,It‚Äôs comfy but the shirt keeps coming up
4.0,Great old church in urban area outside large cities & towns! Sits great in countryside near farmhouses &  woodland areas!
4.0,The sizing chart is perfect the dress I order fit perfectly to my measurements according to their chart. It is a great dress for the price!
4.0,Nice shirt but small to size. I would buy size up.
4.0,"A light, flowy dress perfect for the summer.  It seems like the fabric wrinkles easily but given the color (I got the blue), it's not too bad to wear through out the day."
4.0,"This money clip looks about as I expected it to.  I tend to carry 6 or 7 cards at a time, along with some cash and it's SUPER TIGHT!!"
4.0,It's very pretty and you can't beat the price. I didn't give 5 stars because I had a Swarowski Disco Ball earrings before and the quality was better.
4.0,Good fit but cheaper quality shirt. Just needs a good iron before wear and it‚Äôs great
4.0,"It's a great product and well-made, but I was sent the wrong color/design. It's still a beautiful design and I don't have complaints, but it wasn't what I ordered."
4.0,"I bought these because they perfectly match a shirt that I have.  My only complaint is that the solid gold one has somewhat rough edges.  No big deal for me, since I probably won't wear that one anyway.  I'm a very large woman and the fit is great!"
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. Ideal for a nice events. Comfortable. The fabric is a bit thick and needs to be ironed after a wash. All in all, good purchase"
4.0,they look nice
4.0,"Esta bonito el color me gusto ,ordene talla 4 y quedo perfecto para mi hijo"
4.0,"These swim goggles fit well, had great suction, didn't seem to leave a mark on my face. I did try a different size for a better fit to the size of my face. Overall, a great product."
4.0,"I thought it was actually going to be embroidered but it was just printed on, which is fine for a cheap dress. Besides that it's a nice fit and very lightweight."
4.0,"Great Glasses, nice fit."
4.0,So I give this dress my thumbs up approval of being plus size friendly üëçüèª<br /><br />It goes up to an XL.<br />For reference I am a size 16/18 5‚Äô8‚Äù 230 42D-39-45<br /><br />This dress actually was longer and went to my knees so I liked that. But if you want to adjust it and make it shorter you can easily pull the draw strings on the sides.<br /><br />It is ribbed and made well. Not too thick and not too thin.<br /><br />Admittedly it was a little tight around my chest putting it on but that was OK it stretched and even after I put it on I was able to still pull it around my chest for even more stretch.  I would say this dress in an XL can easily accommodate a size 16/18/20.<br /><br />Sexy little black dress with long sleeves.<br />It is tight and body con which you can see from the photos but as I mentioned has plenty of stretch to it. And don‚Äôt worry about the length because you can adjust that you can have it at your knees mid thigh or shorter.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful for you.
4.0,Might be a little big but I'll still wear it. Looks great with a backless shirt.
4.0,Light n great look
4.0,Arrived in timely manner. Good jacket for spring through fall.
4.0,My dayghter loved it
4.0,Really cute cut!
4.0,"I ordered these shades for myself for Christmas.  I am terrible at picking out a good pair of sunglasses and I was very hesitant to buy a pair online.. but these were a steal at $75 + free shipping.  The product came within a few days of ordering and came in a heavy duty leather case.  The frame of my pair is actually slightly bent- when I put the sunglasses on a flat surface upside down, they do not sit even (one side is about a cm off the surface while the other lays flat).  Fortunately, the defect is not at all noticeable when wearing them.  I think they look great and my girlfriend really likes them.  I would recommend these to any dude who wants to get a decent priced pair of designer shades and wants to look slick."
4.0,It‚Äôs kinda looks like Kermit the frog but dead. The plush is just not shaped well. Sent it back.
4.0,"I love this romper! It fits perfect, and so comfy."
4.0,"Love the style. Well worth the buy. I ordered a size 4 (which I'm normally is), however this is still big. I had to cut the length and adjust the straps to fit me. FYI, I had to do it adjust it myself since the event was the next day I got the dress. So, check your size carefully and do order a smaller size."
4.0,I absolutely love this bag! It‚Äôs very small tho
4.0,I bought the size I always do in clothes. This one fit a tad tighter but not so bad. But if you like it loose fitting just get a size larger than usual.
4.0,The moon keychain‚Äôs opal crystal fell out the first day i got it‚Ä¶
4.0,The glasses were very light on the face and nice looking for a gift<br />Not too sure about the seeing in the night thing I need to test them when I have a chance
4.0,"Loving this shirt! I like longer hem shirts that I can wear with jeggings or leggings, and I needed a nice burgundy shirt. The material is nice and soft - which I'm glad since the pictures made me think it would be a stiffer fabric. If you're looking for a comfortable, long hem dolman sleeve top, this is a great choice!"
4.0,The dress was a good value when I purchased it and it arrived quickly. It fit well and seemed quite nice but anything that snagged it (including a glitter gift bag) made it pill terribly. Washing and drying it made it so much worse and it already looks old and worn after only one wash. (It may say dry clean only but I‚Äôm a rebel). I still feel like I got my money‚Äôs worth out of it because it is pretty cute and comfy and the black disguises the pilling mostly.
4.0,Very cute but much smaller than I expected..great price though!
4.0,"It is a very well crafted piece, exquisite in detail, and maybe too much so.<br />The tail is too sharp to wear comfortably next to skin."
4.0,"I am very pleased with the quality of this product. The exterior plaid material is 100% polyester, and the 100% cotton fuzzy interior lining that extends through the arms is very comfortable, and instantly warm. I am normally a small in tops (I'm 5'3&#34; 32D/130lbs) and the medium I ordered fits perfectly with a long sleeved or short sleeved t-shirt underneath. I wanted to size up so I could wear it as a camping/work shirt jacket with a sweater underneath for those super cold nights like we've had lately. However, as a personal preference, the medium fits too perfectly to add any bulk underneath, so I will exchange it for the large size. Also, just to be honest and not at all nitpicky, the blue color is a little less bright than is shown in the picture (it's navy blue instead of royal blue), but it is still a very nice looking color and pattern. The only thing that would make this my go-to favorite camping/work shirt jacket, and earn a 5 star rating, is adding side pockets. I would still recommend making this purchase."
4.0,"I really like the dress!!! It is good to do errands, comfortable but not son unformal. The delivery had a dely, but apart for that, all good."
4.0,"Very durable belts & comfortable, well made.  A little hard to lift the part of the buckle that cinches the belt for adjustment, the benefit is that it will not come loose on its own."
4.0,"The color is great, the style is great!  They are not snow gloves, but better for chilly/windy weather.  The finger tips didn't work on my phone or my daughters phone.  We had to take our gloves off to take pictures."
4.0,Relieved my fullness leg sensations
4.0,Wonderful cool material.
4.0,"Bought this for my son to wear during his concerts. It fit great, I was afraid it would fit oddly but there were no awkward bulges and it sat evenly on his stomach."
4.0,"IT IS SO PRETTY! I  LOVE THE MATERIAL, SOFT AND FAST DRYING."
4.0,I like the look and the ear hooks but they are hard to wear in hot climate as they stick to your mouth when you breath in.  I would order them again as just put up with that as otherwise they are comfortable.
4.0,"I didn't know what to expect, but the fit was great"
4.0,For a very small wrist. My slender 7 year old said it was too tight. I say it‚Äôs perfect for 5 year olds and under
4.0,I am very pleased and surprised with the quality of this item. The inner lining is very nice and very soft. My only negative is that sizing runs a little small. Had I known I would have gotten an X-large.
4.0,Value for money and good coverage
4.0,It works as advertised.. it doesn‚Äôt fit fully so the watch slides and rattles around. Other than that no complaints!
4.0,They are a little thin but they do there job well.
4.0,Botton & top fit well & are flattering. Only negative is that I have to keep adjusting the fabric on the top to keep the black shinny part covering up the white inner layer.
4.0,"It's smaller than expected. After a dip in Tarn-X, a polish, it looks just fine. No gripes."
4.0,Nice hat . Has a bending material in it so you can shape it how you want it. Not a big floppy hat so its better then I had expected it to be. Came in a neat package folded up and I thought that would have damaged it but it molded to what I wanted when I put it on . Good buy.
4.0,"I love these pants and the look and feel are great. They are very cute and stylish! However, the largest size they have appears to be a 10 (which is what I ordered) and they are too snug around my hips. I have an hourglass shape and my hips are curvy. I normally wear a 6 or 8 in pants or dresses and the size 10 is snug enough to the point that I need to return these. I wish they had a larger size for normal bodies!"
4.0,"These are a very nice pair of knee socks, they fit me very nicely and great with my knee high boots. The reason I have them 4 starts is because I really  did expect them to be much thicker and warmer. . They are kind of lightweight which will be perfect for warmer months. Very nicely made though.... Good material<br />."
4.0,Great quality. Runs a bit smaller than others i bought from same manufacturer though.
4.0,"This romper is really cute and my daughter loves it. I would give it 5 stars, but the button on the back is really hard for kids so my daughter just leaves it unbuttoned"
4.0,"I wasn't sure about the clasp at first but it's held up just fine.  It's slightly bigger than I expected length-wise, but it's a nice piece overall."
4.0,Lots of compliments on the dress.  I was very happy with it.
4.0,Good value. Really cute
4.0,Beautiful watch. I am used to wearing watches with a bigger head but it is a great piece for the price.
4.0,Fits true to size. Great to wear during workouts!
4.0,Like the style fits very tight at the front of the foot and toes
4.0,"These are my favorite actually, and I wear them often"
4.0,small and stylish!<br />smaller than I thought!
4.0,I was afraid to buy viscose as I like cotton but not nylon. This material was a pleasant surprise along with the nice colors. It makes me thinner and it comes up to my real waist! I am buying them again.  The only change I would like them to make is the crotch to come up higher in the back.
4.0,"It's a beautiful piece altogether, and I'm keeping it because it really looks great -- but it arrived long sleeved, not 3/4. And the belt is a bit flimsy. Also, there is no &#34;jacket&#34; piece. The part that looks like a blazer/jacket is part of the dress. Fits great and shapes your curves beautifully."
4.0,"If needed extra pieces for maid costume, this is the one! As expected, and received all items"
4.0,Great shoes!  But delivered with a small stain.. see picture:
4.0,Very useful and nice quantity.  Just what I wanted and will have enough to last me a while.  Thank you.
4.0,"There is a lot to like about this bag. It's well organized, nicely made, and I lover the chartreuse interior. Makes it so easy to find things.<br />Made of a nice study, but attractive fabric. More lightweight than leather which matters if you carry a lot in your purse, as I do. Looks like it could be laundered if it gets dirty.  This is my everyday go-to bag. I gave it only 4 stars because the plastic clip made to hold your keys is already loosened and doesn't hold the keys as well as it should. It's a minor issue but should have lasted longer than a month."
4.0,"Color warning!  ""King Cash's Mescaline Mocktail"" = GOLD, not the yellow it appeared to be in the picture.  Great glasses and now I know why these were the last color left on Amazon.  It looked like I was buying shiny gold shades for my 80's hip hop costume."
4.0,"Fit my daughter‚Äôs phone perfectly and the design is super adorable.. she owns the silver iPhone 5s and the design is slightly visible from a distance, but nonetheless it‚Äôs adorable once up close.. may look way better on the pink one, as shown."
4.0,A little smaller than I was expecting (about two inches long) but still nice.  They contain a small slip of paper that you can write on to identify each.
4.0,"For the price this works. Very cute shoe, stays on well due to ankle strap, does crinkle a bit when bent, but what can you expect with this material? It doesnt leave lasting marks after it fades."
4.0,doesn't look quite like the photo but still cute
4.0,"Very comfortable, but have to wash separately to stay the bright white color, I wish they had made this also in hunter green."
4.0,Lovely print and comfortable. Feels like a t-shirt but not cotton. Definitely hand wash and line dry or lay flat. You will need a slip and belt.
4.0,"These are super cute! I will say the bottom two rows are MASSIVE, they looked a bit odd on my ears, but they‚Äôre very light weight which is nice when I‚Äôm wearing three at a time (multiple piercings)!"
4.0,"I adore the bottom. It hits right above my belly button which is perfect for me as it covers up my stretch marks. The top is a little large which I found surprising as I wear a 34d bra, and this has never been a problem before. With a little sewing I was able to fix the top to fit my body and now it is just the perfect bikini for me. I had very low expectations due to the low price, but it's holding up fantastic! I am going to order a second suit so that when this one shows normal wear I have another one to use. As far as bikinis go, this is a flattering style for nearly all shapes. The color is an intense black with small white polka dots. The inside of the suit is also black and double layered. The top does have built in cups and underwire so it's very supportive."
4.0,"Good price. A little less flexible than expected or desired. But still a good buy. For anyone who doesn't want to pay the price of the originals, this is a super buy. Yes you get three different colors and sizes as pictured."
4.0,This dress is pretty big it‚Äôs very baggy. It‚Äôs a relaxed fit. Overall I like it wish it came in an XS
4.0,Fits well but is not a dress. Seen here with some spandex shorts. Makes a decent top though. I'm 190 5feet4inches ordered a medium. If you want it to be a dress size up once or twice.
4.0,"This was so pretty. My wrist is small so I was worried, but hoped it would work by twisting like some reviewers mentioned.  No amount of twisting made it fit, but if you have a larger wrist this would be great."
4.0,Bought this for tendenitis.  Seems to work...just hard to tell if its the bracelet or something else.  . . .
4.0,"Pretty decent for the price, but not spectacular."
4.0,"The material is great and I really like it, but my daughter is tall and has a behind so it fall shorter than I like."
4.0,Looks very nice on the body.
4.0,Really cute my size but way too large. Had to return.
4.0,"I have the mid weight and these fit a little smaller in the same size, large.  I noticed the sleeves are a little shorter."
4.0,"I was skeptical to order this dress based on the mixed reviews but I'm glad I did! I'm 5'8&#34;, 175# and ordered a size large. It fits me well with a tiny bit of room. It does not fit quite as loose as in the model photo but is also far from tight or fitted. The fabric is soft, comfy and breathable. It has pockets which is a huge plus on a dress. It doesn't bother me that they emphasise the hips a bit. Many other reviewers have mentioned that the dress doesn't fit like on the model but I think that is because most of us (myself included) don't have a model body and breasts that stand perfectly at attention (LOL). That aside, I'm happy with the dress and think it will be great for my upcoming summer vacation!"
4.0,A bit large but super cute!
4.0,"These are a bit wide and of course a bit short. I expected them to be short and less wide. I would order them again. Even though the material is a bit thinner than LuLaRoe leggings, I prefer these to the overpriced LuLaRoe leggings. Better pattern choices and less trouble to order them :)."
4.0,"The socks are OK, just didn't realize they were men's sizes, so we sent them back."
4.0,"Love these!  They are amazingly comfortable and squat proof!  The only downside to these pants is that they tend to slide, as most workout leggings do."
4.0,"I like these. I originally came across the brand from an article about ‚Äúsquat proof‚Äù leggings. I purchased these hoping that they would not be see-through. They do have a sheen, which makes it look like you can see through them. I ordered a large and they fit perfectly."
4.0,Had identical shirt from another retailer. Love the open back gray to wear with a bralette or nothing at all under it.
4.0,LOOKS PRETTY CHEAPLY MADE AND THIN MATERIAL.
4.0,"It is a little bit pricy,  and medium fits little tight,  but I like the many pockets."
4.0,Plan to wear it for Christmas. It is a fun piece.
4.0,"Very nice, but know it won't last!"
4.0,Very trendy and in style right now. I've gotten many compliments on the design and look. Only reason for 4 stars is I feel they are a bit on the thin/flimsy side. Otherwise happy with my purchase.
4.0,Good for the price üëç
4.0,"These are soft and SUPER comfortable, BUT... Because of the indentation on bottom, it creates a seal with vinyl plank floor. It literally suctions to floor A LOT. Ended up cutting a slit on the edge, which completely fixed the problem, but very odd, never had that happen before."
4.0,Looks beautiful and just like the picture. Be wary of wearing it for long periods of time because the metal will tarnish and will appear red or rusted. Otherwise a wonderful piece.
4.0,"Fits great, is a little longer than I expected, but I should learn that by now (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 1‚Äù). I ordered a small, and it fits comfortably, on the waist. It goes down to my shins though, so it‚Äôs longer than I expected. Its good quality material, has pockets, and the skirt is lined down to the knee so that‚Äôs a plus. The color in the picture is a rusty (orangey) brown, but in person it‚Äôs a true chocolate brown.  I still like it."
4.0,Love these. They are a little loose in the waist.
4.0,"This cross looks cool, gets compliments, but oh how i hate that chain!!! So many reviews say it but its true. Ive been walking down the street and the cross just falls off me. Buy the cross and replace the chain,because the bad chain isnt worth not buying this amazing looking cross"
4.0,Ron's wife here  - this sports bra is comfortable and looks like the photo.  I ordered the XL for a 38B bra size and it fits perfectly.  I have used it once at the gym and washed it once in the machine on warm (hung to dry) and it was fine.  Great price.  I will order another.  I don't understand the reference to &#34;shiny&#34; but maybe that applies to another color.  The white with pink piping is bright white but not what I would call shiny.
4.0,"I loved the stone , it was bigger than what I thought but it‚Äôs beautiful<br />Thanks Amazon"
4.0,Nice bands but they are replicas
4.0,"This money belt was offered to me for free. The following is my unbiased review after testing it out.<br /><br />The first things I noted was that the fabric is soft, though it does have a texture to it. It is almost a bit rough, but it did not irritate my skin when left on for a six hour trial.<br /><br />This money belt is a fairly straight forward affair. It is designed to be worn under clothes when traveling so that it is harder for someone to pick pocket you. By putting the contents of your wallet inside here, it is hard to swipe those items.<br /><br />This has two pockets, I liked that, it meant that I could put my id, house key, and a credit card in the front pocket and my cash/passport in the back.<br /><br />This is a bit too thick for hiding under clinging clothes, so be sure to wear a loose top or the outline of the pouch will show. You might also carry a small amount of cash in a pocket so that you are not having to use the money belt to access cash while standing in front of a cashier. (Thieves are always watchful!)<br /><br />All in all, it is easy to adjust to fit my waist, easy to get on/off, I only sweated a minimal amount under it. The beige/nude color allows it to blend in under even light colored clothes."
4.0,This watch band cought so many eyes. It's very pretty. Only this is that it can stretch out a little.
4.0,"This bag is very sturdy and I love the style.  I just wish it was a tiny bit larger.  The zipper compartment in the center constricts the amount of interior space on either side of it, so there are certain larger items I would normally be inclined to throw inside it (like a binder) that simply won't fit."
4.0,Looks nice but the pants were too big like for 9 months old. Anyway my baby boy looked very cute at Christmas
4.0,It make you sweat  and are comfortable.
4.0,Comfortable shirt and looks nice a well.
4.0,Nice shirt but smaller than expected. I normally wear a small but I should have ordered a medium.
4.0,It was a little big.  Maybe it is a mens small.
4.0,"Great shirt, runs a little small"
4.0,This is the perfect travel bag. There are tons of pockets inside and out as well as on the sides for a water bottle. (The top has a zipper closure) I have one and bought one as a gift. The one star is taken off because I used this on the plane and it worked great but then after I returned I carried my laptop and a few small items in it to work one time and the handle broke. For travel it's great but I wouldn't use this for my laptop and feel secure about it. It would also be a great diaper bag if you want something more sophisticated.
4.0,"These are really cute earrings, but they are a little heavy to wear. They are metal, which means they look great, but are not particularly light-weight. I don't typically wear earrings that are this heavy, and they feel a little strange after wearing them for a few hours. They would be fine to wear to a game or whatever, but I have a hard time wearing them all day."
4.0,"There are a lot of these in different colors and sizes.  I use the big ones for hanging my cookware and the small one for hanging the keys on my purse.  I only found one of the big ones that did not close properlyl  Overall, a great bargain for hanging lightweight things;"
4.0,Zipper sucks but fits nice and warm
4.0,This top fits as expected but the material seems to be different on half of the shirt. One side is smooth and the other has a bit of texture like the pictures. It‚Äôs not super noticeable & is still cute but bugs me a bit.
4.0,Very pretty but I had issues with it coming off maybe better for those with shorter hair that doesn't dangle by the ear
4.0,I bought for my 77 year old father who always wears suspenders. He loved them!  He couldn't wait to wear them.  My only feedback is..is there a better place to put the light control switch?  In the back makes it difficult to change your lighting needs on the fly.
4.0,"My wife really likes them. Comfy, warm, water resistant as advertise. Good product"
4.0,Just as I remember the from the old days when spittoons were in many offices even though it's a decorative item for me.
4.0,THIS IS A GREAT BELT. LOOKS ATTRACTIVE AND IS SO EASY TO ADJUST.
4.0,I wear these to the gym and they are very comfortable.
4.0,"My wife loves it, but...<br />Loaded up the bag is bigger than her! If only this thing came with wheels"
4.0,It was nice except too large. I wear them anyway
4.0,Good price for quality backpack
4.0,A little tight but still like it
4.0,I didn't wear it yet but was not what I was expecting. Thin. But I will wear it around the house.
4.0,"This seems to be a nice-quality sock. Feels good and fits well in the foot. Nice thickness. My only grips: I have normal-sized calves, and these fit a little tight in the calf."
4.0,"I like the fit of this vest, however I did find it shifting around a little when running, a little rubbing occurred around my neck, but because I use body glide I did not have chaffing from it. Otherwise it worked great, the two bottles that came with it are nice and I like the fact that I have the option to add a bladder too. Also, while it felt a little warm on the back, when I took it off it it did not feel heavy from sweat, so it‚Äôs a great lightweight option."
4.0,"They work well, but they are too small for my arms. I use them around my ankles when i run.<br />Pros:<br />Chargeable<br />Good battery life<br />Bright<br />Cons:<br />Short strap"
4.0,"Definitely order a size up, but very nice design"
4.0,The shine wears off very quickly but I prefer the matte look anyways. I love them sending multiple sizes since it made it finding the right size to wear very easy and you can give the other sizes to friends so they can try out silicone rings too.
4.0,They are better than I expected but the frame is a little too light.
4.0,"I like fisherman type sandals for traveling, keeps feet cool. These are very light weight and comfortable."
4.0,"Cute and easy to put in and take out, but the gem fell out of one within a month or two."
4.0,"You get what you pay for. Good price, so so quality."
4.0,"The seams are a bit thick, making these less than max comfort. But, they are made from durable breathable material and I like the cut."
4.0,Great product for the price and looks cool
4.0,"This is a comfortable band (this is the ""crocheted"" model). However, it snags *very* easily. So watch it when it's close to anything velcro! Wear with care."
4.0,a bit too thick in material and definitely very large in size
4.0,"I really like this cute little bracelet.<br />This stretchy bracelet comes in varying colors of blue ranging from aqua to pale baby blue. Some of the beads are two toned. Though the description states the color as sky blue, my bracelet is more in the aqua tones. Very pretty.<br />There is a buddha head and two other symbols all in a silver tone and it is a little loose on my wrist ( I am not tiny) so this should comfortably fit larger wrists too.<br /> I am into all things yoga or buddha so this a really nice addition to my other jewelry.<br /><br />I received this at a discounted price for my honest review."
4.0,"This dress is great. I did have to hem it a few inches, and I also ordered a size up. Overall, the dress is comfy and pretty!"
4.0,"This is a cute dress.  It‚Äôs exactly as pictured. I loved the color and the print (also exactly as pictured).  The fabric is polyester I guess but feels soft and is flowy.  Unfortunately, the cut wasn‚Äôt the most flattering on me (I am 5‚Äô2, 34DD, generally between a  4 and a 6). I felt like this cut made me look heavier than I am.<br />So cute overall just not my favorite on me.  FYI - this hit well above my knee so I think this might be extremely short on someone over 5‚Äô6. Just my 2 cents."
4.0,"These are a taller version of the ever-so-popular Chelsea boot, which makes them feel a little rocker-ish (relive your youth much? Ha!).<br /><br />The soles are nice and chunky, the uppers seem to be well-constructed, and the insoles are actually really comfortable! If you get these, do NOT pull on the tabs to assist with pulling them on - one of them pulled right off when I tried these on for the first time. I was able to fix it, but it was a little disappointing with a brand-new pair of boots.<br /><br />Overall, I love them and they will be a regular in my wardrobe!"
4.0,I would love these except that I have a high  instep and they run a little too tight for that.
4.0,Love the bag and all of the outer pockets.  Do NOT like the flimsy divider that separates the two pockets inside.  Would sure be nice for that to actually stand firm and separate instead of lying flat on the bottom of bag.
4.0,"Pro: High Luster pearl, good quality, excellent packaging and good price.<br />Con: Pearl size is much smaller than presented online."
4.0,"It's perfect lightweight and I enjoy wearing it as a cover up, it fits really nice.<br /><br />The only complaint is that is pretty thin. The string at the bottom of my jacket got stuck on something and the tug ripped the whole big where the string comes out of. It was a easy fix .but ya."
4.0,Cute earrings just too small. Sent back.
4.0,2 FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.
4.0,Liked the style of the dress. I ordered the olive green. Was not a true olive green I think I was sent the brown instead. Decided to keep the dress because I liked it will order it in another color.
4.0,"Let me preface this and say, I'm a 45 year old Mom of two...and I had my doubts. It worked. But I had to get low. I had to hike the dress up and work a good few minutes to get it in place properly (some practice may be in order). I definitely peed on my hand, a lot but my garment was dry...so it worked. I think if anymore alcohol was involved when using it (we were at a wedding), it could have gone worse but I managed it. Would recommend."
4.0,Sizes are a bit larger than true fit. Overall satisfied with my purchase
4.0,Lovely but too small. Be sure to check the sizing chart carefully. These are NOT plus sizes!
4.0,It's a tank . Two tone. gets the job done.
4.0,I bought a large and the dress fit good. Not to big or small. A medium would probably be a little more fitted.  I got another dress from this seller in a medium and it was fitted. I guess it depends on how the dress was made. I'm 145 pounds and 5'4. The dress was cute and classy. Nice for a conservative event or church.
4.0,"More white than print , it's hard to tell what the pattern is. Definitely buy a larger size ! I'm 5'2"" and about 118lbs and the medium barely fit."
4.0,Good price point and worked great for family pics
4.0,"Cute style, nice color, decent quality but runs small in the bust.  I normally wear an XL top, bought this in XXL and it‚Äôs uncomfortably tight across the chest."
4.0,Very fashionable. Also warm.
4.0,Small ran more like a medium.
4.0,"Trying to find good t-shirts can be a challenge at times, especially when purchasing them online.<br /><br />When this arrived I was impressed at the quality and how soft it was! The size was a perfect fit and it's quickly become a favorite for my son.<br /><br />Even with lots of use it washes well and doesn't get stretched out. It still looks great and the distressed look works well for that."
4.0,These are beautiful boots. Unfortunately I ordered a half size up and they are too big.
4.0,"Good design, hope its a lot bigger n more pictures to put in."
4.0,I ordered this larger because someone posted on Here that being 5-10&#34; made a difference.  Now it's pretty bulky.  I'm 6-1&#34; and I think I could have probably gotten away with a medium instead of large.  Oh well.  The quality is good.  I'm going to take it in.  I would disregard that review.  I think it's just someone being picky.  The sweater comes past my hip and I'm very tall.
4.0,"This is an attractive, well-made tassel keychain. The size is just right, and the leather tassel looks like it will hold up well. There are two clasps, both of which are very small. I wish that one of the clasps was larger and easier to attach and detach."
4.0,Good quality. I am looking forward to getting my bag now.
4.0,"The picture appears as a lose fit, but not sure if it will survive the washer and dryer."
4.0,"The dress was very cute, and the colors were vibrant. However, I first purchased a medium, and it was VERY big (I'm kinda busty, so I was surprised by this.) I returned it and ordered a small, and it was VERY tight across the chest. I had to return that one, too. Returns were incredibly quick and easy, but I was very disappointed."
4.0,Very thin material. Doesn't fit as I expected.
4.0,This size didn‚Äôt fit inside most of my pant‚Äôs loops.
4.0,"Also sprung a dime size hole after its first go in the wash, although there were some open zippers and buckles in the mix so I feel I‚Äôm half to blame on that"
4.0,Pretty dress but does not fit up to on a 38D
4.0,"Loved the color. Had to exchange for a large, the medium was a little snug in the stomach area."
4.0,The band is very nice and great for large wrists. The fit between the lugs is SUPER tight to the point you may need to grind the each side of the band down ever so slightly to attach the band. The end of the band that mounts to the top of the watch has a small channel/indentation so it doesn't block the speaker port. I would have given 5 stars if I hadn't had to break out my Dremel to make it fit.
4.0,Fabric feels great
4.0,"I love this swim cover, but didn‚Äôt realize it is see-through. I have the same color swimsuit for underneath, but was expecting a thicker fabric based on the photos. Still plan to wear it and enjoy at the beach."
4.0,Cumfort
4.0,"I'm 5'7"" 130lbs, weight evenly distributed. I ordered the M and it was like a large at least 2-3 inches to large in the waist and chest. No label on the dress with a size indication just a sticker with an M on it, but I definitely don't think it was a Medium. I got the Navy, it is a beautiful dress and seemed comfortable to wear had it fit properly."
4.0,"fit great, very cute, they wrinkle a little easily and the white gets dingy quickly"
4.0,Fits well if you do not have a lot of hair or very thick hair.  Could use more room in back of cap for ponytail or bun to tuck.
4.0,I got this for the Taylor Swift I'm going to and it's perfect! Great quality for the price I think.
4.0,Fit very well.  Like it.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter in law!  She loves them and so do I!  They are fun and comfortable!
4.0,Bought as present for my daughter. She liked it because she really likes camo. Sizing seems correct. But this is a thin sweatshirt not a thick material.
4.0,I have bought two so far but they had diffrent belts that came with them. One of the belts was really good but the other was a cheap wide one.
4.0,A bit smaller then I expected and difficult to get on because the bracelet is stiff
4.0,I'm 5'9 125lbs and it fit really cute. For those who have said the hole is to big you can just pull the top higher and it is not revealing. Good quality and support. I ordered the small pink one and the bottom color didn't match the Chevron lines as well as it looks in the picture. Bottoms are bright and match the tie string but the Chevron is not bright.
4.0,"Super comfy, but it shows its wear quickly.  Still not bad for the price"
4.0,The bracelet is cute but very delicate.
4.0,"Love it! I use it as a blanket, shawl, or scarf.. The fabric is thick enough to provide plenty of warmth. I only gave it a 4 star because the frayed ends are not secured and sewn in.. so with multiple uses and one time in wash, bits of the shawl started to unravel."
4.0,"They're cute, but they run quite large. Not ideal for chokers. But if you like the loose fit, then you'll love these."
4.0,"It's a nice apron, but the strap across the shoulders has to go! It is really uncomfortable"
4.0,I love them! Just way overpriced!
4.0,"It was a very nice shirt but the problem was that it was cut in front, I didn't reconize it till I wear it"
4.0,"I bought these sports bras after reading the title of &#34;high impact.&#34; However, they're not the best sport bras I've ever had. They are really good for wearing around though! So if you're looking for a high impact sports bra, keep searching. If you're looking for something comfortable enough to wear all the time, grab these."
4.0,"Really nice jeans for the price, very slim fit all the way down and then small flare. Fabric isn't itchy or super cheap which often comes with this price point"
4.0,"Great for what I needed it for! Definitely a costume piece, I would not wear it daily."
4.0,"I purchased this mask for a Lion King themed Halloween party at work. Only issue is that you can't see very well with it on, as well as a spray-paint-like smell. But I love how it looks!"
4.0,"Likes: -Lots of pockets & roomy pockets -very comfortable, not too tight or too loose -colors true to photo<br /><br />Dislikes: -No back pocket"
4.0,Exactly as described and color was true to the pictures. The material is soft and a perfect length for an infinity scarf. They even have a pocket! Overall good quality for the price.
4.0,Pretty dress wanted this for a while. Longer than exspected. Really tight in the arms debating whether or not to keep or return.
4.0,"The dress is comfortable and light.  However, if you are short, you will need to adjust the length.  The V-neck opening is also deep, so you may need to adjust.  The quality is okay for the price."
4.0,I bought this for my mom and she really likes it. Very comfortable and cool.
4.0,Some of the gems are slightly crooked but nothing too obvious unless you're up close. Very cute
4.0,"I order this gift for my mom and her really loved that. Her said me The quality is very good, it adjusts to the body and absorbs sweat, it is quick drying, and the long sleeves protect from the sun, the back part that is padded is very comfortable."
4.0,"Heeded advice of others and sized up to a medium. I am typically a size 4, but do not like anything tight around my legs. The navy fit great, more like a small in my other exercise skorts. The white and aqua were really big. It seems different colors are sized differently, I'll be sending the white and aqua back. My advice is order a few and see which works best.  Nice item for the money if you can get the fit right."
4.0,Love the material<br />Should have ordered larger size but it works fine because I wear it under my shirt
4.0,Feel like walking over clouds.
4.0,"Pendant is very nice. Engraving  and design is very clear. I purchased this for my 23 year old grandson who was being deployed for the 3rd time in 3 years. My only dissappointment is the the size of the hole in the top. If he would want to remove it from the chain and put it on a key ring, for instance, it is too small unless he leaves the extra ring on it."
4.0,"I really love the detailing on this dress.  It is super cute on, and you can tie the tie in the back or the front, so you can wear it several different ways.  The dress in itself is well made, but there were strings off of the buttons.  This would have me a bit worried, but the buttons are only there for decoration and aren't actually used as buttons (it would not be good for a button to fall off and then have that part of your dress hanging wide open.<br /><br />I like the top detailing, but when I put it on, the top hem on the front didn't stay up very well with a little bit of tugging.  I had to fix it several times before it actually laid correctly.  They should have put some sort of elastic in that part of the dress.  However, it probably wouldn't have been a big deal if I were smaller chested (I'm a 32DDD).<br /><br />When I took it out of the package it was quite wrinkly, so it would need to be ironed.  The dress is 100% cotton so that is expected.  The only other downfall to the dress is that it says that professional dry cleaning is recommended, which sorry, isn't going to happen with me.  So hopefully just hang drying it will suffice.  (I'll update my review if it doesn't).<br /><br />For reference I'm 120-125 pounds and 5 foot 5 inches - I bought a small"
4.0,The material was a little thinner than expected but it does the job.
4.0,I read a comment to buy a one size bigger and that comment was wrong ! I am a extra small and bought small. It looks like a medium on me! Other than that it's a nice dress  good material
4.0,"The glasses look great. It's a little big for my face but that's what I get for having a small face.<br /> The product seems durable. Not to mention the price is very affordable and I agree with the other reviews below, it does appear like you bought it with a very expensive price tag. One problem is that, I originally ordered the black golden, but I received the black and grey. It's not a big deal, though. I realized that I liked it much better because it is much simpler. The color would compliment anything that I would wear. Hope that the seller won't make this mistake again to other potential customers."
4.0,"Great fit, seems to be good quality fabric. Would have gave a 5 star if made in America"
4.0,Fits nicely but I would prefer it be looser around the chest
4.0,Great pair of shorts for our athletic girl.<br />Should not have charged $10.37 for UPS ground for 1 pound.
4.0,"The burgundy slippers don't look anything like the picture. In the picture, the shearling lining looks bright red and the paisley looks like it's a silvery blue. They look very elegant. In reality, the shearling is light burgundy and the paisley is indistinguisable on the dark burgundy background. They must have adjusted the shadow and contrast in Photoshop to get that picture that looks NOTHING like it really does. I'm attaching a picture of what they really look like - just a burgundy slipper with no distinguishable paisley print and a lighter burgundy shearling. Also the bottom, which isn't shown in my picture either, is very visible in real life. It's a very light tan and is printed with snoozies! in diagonal lines in about a font size of 18 pt. all over the bottom... about 35 times on the bottom of the size XL I purchases. Very busy and on a much brighter background than the rest of the slipper.<br /><br />Now, as far as the more important stuff... the lining feels amazing and the workmanship seems of a superior quality. I think my husband is going to love these in his Xmas stocking.<br /><br />I would have given them 5 stars, but I dropped it to 4 because they look nothing like the picture and because the logo is way too prominent covering the bottom of the slippers."
4.0,Few loose threads needed to be taken care of but the fabric and color are very nice.
4.0,super cute. love them.. I wear a 12 - big butt - and these fit a little too tight @ an XL.
4.0,My daughter love this
4.0,"The bracelet is adjustable, so it would fit any size wrist, or even a small ankle. No clasp to fiddle with. The Jade coins are nicely carved and a pretty medium green color. Good for anyone who loves Jade and any natural stone. Affordable."
4.0,"Beautiful shoe, with embroidered heel and feminine styling. The heel is just the right height for me. They fit well, but still hurt when I wore them the first time. Oh, and the original heels were way too slippery, so I had a cobbler replace the plastic heels with rubber ones. Cost me $20, which I wasn't happy about, but I had to do it. Otherwise, I would have slipped and fallen on my behind. LOL"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, with rich colors - very soft, but you need something underneath because it is a bit itchy, like wool, but with a turtleneck it feels fine."
4.0,This is the best lambswool for sore feet! I've tried them all and this lambswool is the best!
4.0,Considerate size
4.0,"I got this as a gift. It did its justice. It fit perfectly, worked fine. The only issue is that the paint chips easily."
4.0,"These are cute capris. Are they thin? Yes, the material is very thin, think thin spandex. My four year old got the ones that included the striped rainbow pair, and those are a little see through when she bends over.<br />With all of that said, I still really like them. My daughter tends to run a hotter base line temp than most kids, so she doesn't like a lot of heavy clothing. These are perfect for her. They're cute and colorful and fun!"
4.0,Hilarious and a bit hit as a gift.
4.0,Lights up one clear color. Good material on outside. Sole was hard.
4.0,Love these so much. So soft. Good quality
4.0,i'm only 4'11 and bought the smallest size. it's still a bit log for me but it was ok when I pair it with my wedge sandals
4.0,Perfect for exercising
4.0,Wash before wearing as graphics and fabric finishing makes these very scratchy if you wear without washing. Bright graphic. Flames are more high quality graphics than skulls. Good size/fit
4.0,Very nice & sturdy weekend back. Great to minimize overpacking ;)
4.0,The locking m√©canisme is in plastic the symbol itself is decent
4.0,"These are very decent for the money, my only gripe is that the viewing areas for each progression is very small"
4.0,Great outfit! Shorts were a little snug for my son. You may want to order a larger size than what you think the actual size is. Delivered on time. Would recommend.
4.0,"Very pretty dress, unfortunately it runs small. Arrived in a timely manner, no shipping complaints."
4.0,Its very nice and flattering but the back is loose.
4.0,At first i was pissed theyre so light weight. Then i wore them and aside from a nice feel they are very warm.
4.0,Well... It looks exactly like the pictures. Just wished it was a bit thicker like normal sweaters but this will do.
4.0,Looked better on than I thought. Really cute!
4.0,Loved it. Looked great. Fit my daughter a little big but she is a skinny gal. Will keep it and am pleased with the value.
4.0,I think I'm going to love this dress in much cooler temperatures. I purchased this dress to wear in late spring but the fabric is heavier and the dress feels very fall or winter.
4.0,Very pretty statement piece. Items was excatly as described fast shipping.
4.0,"First off, this dress is really flattering. Every time I‚Äôve worn it I‚Äôve received so many compliments! I would consider purchasing it in colors but the one thing stopping me is the fabric. It‚Äôs a very thick polyester (almost costume-y) and is not breathable in the slightest. However, it doesn‚Äôt wrinkle which is a plus."
4.0,"It's not the most attractive of coats, but it kept me dry on my trip to Scotland and has continued to do so during the rare Southern California rain showers. It also folds up very small, so it's perfect for traveling in the constantly shifting Scottish weather. I do wish the pockets had some sort of closures. They just have flaps. Otherwise it's a great jacket and I would buy it again."
4.0,"Feels more flexible, softer and less sturdy than the original Garmin band but have had no real issues. The end of the band is constantly falling out of the little strap so I have to adjust it a lot. However overall it has held up well but just gets dirty easily inside the holes. At least it‚Äôs cheap and easy to order a new one!"
4.0,These fit my two year old perfectly. They keep her hands dry and warm on snowy days. So far they are holding up well and seem to be well made. Good gloves for little hands.
4.0,"These are cute, however do not really have a pink hue, they are more orangey-yellow. Still though I'll wear them."
4.0,Somewhat large but super cute
4.0,The sleeves are a bit tight but I'll be able to wear the dress.  I love the color it looks absolutely gorgeous on me.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pinky
4.0,Nice size!I have them on all the time!
4.0,Very pretty but the fit was just a little off. It was baggy in the midsection but everything else was great! Lots of compliments!
4.0,"It's a large hat; we had to glue foam pieces around the inside, so it would not slip over my daughter's face. But the quality of the hat is nice."
4.0,I‚Äôm actually impressed! The gemstone/crystals seem real because they‚Äôre cool to the touch & the white evil eyes are super cute too. I haven‚Äôt ‚Äútested‚Äù it‚Äôs durability yet so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving 4 stars. The black string that attaches to the phone is a little long as well but that‚Äôs the case for all phone charms. It also came with a cute little card as you can see in my photo. Would buy again! Great gift idea as well!
4.0,"The band is about as comfortable as you can get. The plastic is so soft, smooth, and flexible. The face of the watch is about 1.5&#34; in diameter, though. I didn't pay attention to the dimensions or I probably would not have ordered it. It's huge on my wrist but I use it for sports and hiking so it really doesn't matter how it looks. So far, keeping great time. I really like it except for the huge size of the face."
4.0,"Rather large and cumbersome, but ultimately my keys are not falling off so I cant complain."
4.0,My 14 yr old son loved it!  Casual classy.  A bit thinner than expected.
4.0,Love this dress. Sweet and good coverage. Comfortable good quality fabric.
4.0,Mine came with a little green/yellow stick<br />But can't find what it is from the directions that came with :(<br />Haven't tried it on yet. Love the color and feel.
4.0,Very cute but the proportions are a little off.  The legs are short compared to the very wide body.  My daughter is short for her age and the legs still stopped just below her calf.  I was under the impression that the legs were supposed to be full length.  Maybe I was mistaken... But they are still very cute.
4.0,"I don't have much room to move my toe's around in the right one, but I still enjoy wearing them. I'm a male sex and I've ordered a size 10. Besides that-they are gorgeous."
4.0,Cute and fit perfectly. The only thing I dont care for is the stretch of the fabric. It was somewhat stretchy but not as flexible as the typical swimwear you'd buy at a store. My daughter would get frustrated when I put it on her because it was a little inconvenient putting it over her head and getting her arms in.
4.0,"I ordered the size 40 and usually wear a 36-38 and the 40's fit well - praying the washer doesn't make them a size 32!<br />Cool details - good hardware, zips, snaps. I took away one-star b/c the color is off more than expected. These look like they have an initial layer of camo with a blue-gray layer on top. Then sections of the blue-gray are scrubbed away revealing the camo. Great effect but the blue-gray for me is very muddy. Very good fabric/cotton and not too heavy. The bottoms of the legs have elastic sewn in - I'll make a small slit and remove the elastic."
4.0,Runs true to size. Light weight and slightly on the thin side. Shoulder area smaller than images shows. Length on both arms are exactly the same. Not irregular in any measurements I had taken of the shirt received. Mid section is flattering if trying to hide a slight belly.
4.0,It's OK cute even cuter smaller the chain is somewhat small
4.0,"Cute, but design is very asymetrical on the pair we received -- the toe of one boot in nearly entirely pink without the design and the toe of the other has a butterfly. This looks a little odd, but otherwise these are ok for the price."
4.0,"Super cute climbers, I love forward to wearing them."
4.0,"Really cute, but beware if you have a long torso. This is much shorter than anticipated. It's a swimsuit coverup, so it doesn't need to cover much and I'm still going to wear it but it is barely long enough to cover the goods."
4.0,"My daughter loves them, but they look a little cheap to me."
4.0,Just as expected.  Good value  Nice leather strap.  Very basic.  Great traveling watch!
4.0,"I‚Äôm a nurse on a COVID unit and I bought this as a daily hair covering while at work. I like the fit of this hat, However, it‚Äôs not the fit that was advertised. This hat is very small and fits more like a standard surgical cap, just with pleats. The 4 stars is due to fit, even though I like it. Easy to get on and adjust, and the terry cloth sweat band is perfect for what I use this cap for. I‚Äôm in a white cover all suit all day and the sweating is serious. I bought another before I knew about the fit, and will keep them both."
4.0,"Good buy, looks good, slightly slim design which makes torso and shoulders look great."
4.0,received what I ordered and on time. Item seems tight due to the straps over shoulders. Bought for my wife but she only tried on once when we were in a hurry out the door.
4.0,Cute dress but tight on the top portion and arms
4.0,you can't put the checkbook into the wallet if using both. LOVE the checkbook. PS these are NOT shoes
4.0,"Arrived fairly quickly and is as pictured. I'm a little disappointed that the size was smaller than what a normal XL would be but overall, the product is great. I would def buy again!"
4.0,Comfortable for cotton socks. Will be good this summer. Can't match the Browning wool socks for comfort.
4.0,"Look nicE, but feels a bit snug. Just a little narrow to me."
4.0,The arms were a bit stiff. Wished they were a bit bigger but they are still fierce.
4.0,"I was very pleased with this item, for what I paid for the item it was better quality than I thought it would be."
4.0,"The quality of the dress is nice, but it was too big for me. I'm short, so it was obvious that it was going to be super long on me. I would probably have to take over 6 inches off if i wanted it to work.  Also, it wasn't as flattering on me, made me look frumpy and the arms were a little loose too.<br /><br />For reference I'm 5'1"" 34D-26-36 and 124lbs"
4.0,"Good product. Didn‚Äôt do well in the first wash, some of the seams came apart."
4.0,"The vests are nice.  However, they are too small for upper elementary students."
4.0,Love the shoe. It is a little tight.  Otherwise they are comfortable.
4.0,I like this but it is not Tunic length. I ordered the biggest size and it is shirt length. It is very cute but runs very small.
4.0,Fitted along hip area.
4.0,somewhat good
4.0,Only complaint is that the nose piece is molded solid with the eye pieces so it won't properly contour to your face.
4.0,Thinner than I expected but I love them .
4.0,"Something different, very sexy looking."
4.0,These socks were for a Christmas present.  The giftee enjoyed them.
4.0,"They are a little small, ok for me, but perfect for a child."
4.0,Omg I love this jeans üíãüíã‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Even though couple of the change came loose but nothing little needle and thread thread can't fix
4.0,"Look.  I'm so tired of ordering bigger sizes cuz people say the item is so small.  Every single time,  the item turns out way too big,  not small.  This tell me one thing.  GIRLS,  GET REAL ABOUT YOUR TRUE SIZE AND JUST COME TO TERMS WITH IT! If u can't do that then stop posting reviews because it's not right to people like me who keep getting screwed with huge shirts based on your advise!  This shirt is for sure true to size and if anything I think it's a bit large.  I normally wear small and got USA medium and it's huge,  I should have got extra small [I like slim fitting shirts] for reference I am 5'2 120 lb D cup chest (And this shirt was still large in the chest) Also the shirt didn't shrink much in wash,  I had to sew it myself for a better fit but still a little loose for my taste but it's better. Now size stuff aside,  this is a really nice well made shirt.  It's thick and soft. Which is why I kept it and decided to alter it. So unless you like it real baggy,  order YOUR REAL SIZE especially if u want a fit similar to the girl in the picture's.  You will thank me. I promise."
4.0,"the pants are too big for my 2 year old boy but the long sleeve polo just fits right.good materials,doesnt look cheap."
4.0,"Will fit Samsung phones,  Good Quality"
4.0,There not strong but they are definitely a great retro 80's look and feel. It's a good buy for the price.
4.0,"Excellent design, materials and fit - very comfortable to wear!"
4.0,Nice!  Very comfy and stylish!  I'm ready for the beach!
4.0,Really cute!! I think it will be a great  vacation bag!!
4.0,The belt is mostly plastic but it feels good and works great
4.0,"Really enjoyed these shoes for kid! Came with double headed USB charger. Only problem was one shoe had a glitch and after googling found that this was an easy fix by lifting the inner sole and reconnecting the wires/connections. So many compliments when child wore these at appropriate evening outings!! Didn't wear to oten due to school dress code, rain, and occasions that these wouldn't be appropriate in... But other than that, wonderful fun shoes!!!! Would recommend to others! 4 star only because of glitch that too new forever to realize I could fix it myself. Unfortunately, my child has outgrown them, so, I'm passing these along to a friend's kid. I hope they last for a little while longer!!"
4.0,Super stiff. Definitely clear. Click lock closure is cool.  Trying untie then retie strap knots is bit of a task.  All in all it serves its purpose.
4.0,"Very nice, well constructed messenger, roomy too..unfortunately had to return since the top flap was missing a prong and the bag would not close. Packaged nicely; cloth dust bag too."
4.0,Is nice but this top stain my skin even after two washes still doing it. I had to scrub my skin hard in the shower to make it go away.
4.0,"Love these and took them with me to Mexico. Very cute, but not stretchy at the waist. I recommend buying up a size or two on this one."
4.0,Beautiful skirt! This is made nicely and looks great on. I ordered a size medium and it fits great.
4.0,nice but chain  broke after first time I wore it
4.0,Nice for the money. I'm a jewelry maker so I'm going to use the parts for other pieces. Works for me!
4.0,Just wasn't what I was looking for.
4.0,I really like the color but it was too big for me. Can I order the right size it was an extra large. So I gave it as a gift!!!
4.0,"This is a great product for the money. It fits well (still a bit tight, but that's intentional) and makes a nice matching pair with the matching pants. BUYER PLEASE HEED MY ADVICE (and the advice of many many others on here) THAT YOU MUST BUY AT LEAST TWO SIZES LARGER THAN YOUR NORMAL SIZE. I am a Men's Medium for everything, got an XL in this and it is still tight! So please, BUY BIGGER!"
4.0,Light thru the butt
4.0,But it's a very cute outfit
4.0,Makes my Seiko look like 5x the price. Cannot recommend it more. I'm thinking of buying more $100 watches to take advantage of the additional straps.
4.0,"Very cute!! They seem to be of nice quality and arrived quickly. They do not look cheap at all and seem well made. The packaging is quite flimsy, but the earrings were in perfect condition when I received them. I ordered the moon earrings, and the moons are facing a weird direction. The earring itself is also a tiny bit difficult to put on. I have yet to see how they hold up. If you‚Äôre debating purchasing these or not, I advise you to buy these earrings as they are very pretty!"
4.0,This purchase fits well
4.0,Love how thick the material is. Good quality hoodie. Originally ordered my normal size and what came looked like it would fit my 10 year old. Returned and sized up and it fits perfect. Super soft
4.0,"I have a photo of myself back in the early 90s rocking a pair of glasses just like these! Not sure if id go purchase another pair but if these are youre style, they're a for sure win. Good quality, good sun protection, built to last.  Im rating them 4 stars because expected them to be a bit bigger, I dont like when you can see too much eyebrow about the glasses."
4.0,Material was ok fits on the larger size but pretty
4.0,"I really like the designs, the quality and the color, they feel great. I only wish I had read the full description before, I thought they came in pairs! lol but they are super cute and I can mix them with other small earrings on the other ear."
4.0,Some kind of poly/nylon blend but it doesn't wrinkle and feels light on a hot summer day.
4.0,"i didnt order this my boyfriend did but its so cute, although pricey. was perfect for him ^_^"
4.0,fit me so nicely my daughter wants to take them from me :-)
4.0,M√°s omeno
4.0,Well made. Fits as expected. Cute pattern.
4.0,"This was really cute. I'm very sad that the sleeves are made for someone with toothpick arms - - way too tight, though the shoulders, waist, and hips all fit with plenty of room."
4.0,I really like that they fit over my large calves. Thick bands at top and bottom. Really soft too!
4.0,This thing is amazing....Other bodyshapers flatten my booty and then make my shape look weird. It does roll on top and that is kind of annoying.
4.0,"First pair of compression socks I've bought based on the recommendations of my best friend, who is a nurse.  I really like them, although they are a bit tough to put on - at least initially.  Will see how they do after washing once."
4.0,"I like the necklace I just didn't realize how small the rolo actually was. Wear it often however I will be looking for a bigger thicker necklace soon. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend however, everything got here quickly and just how they descibed."
4.0,Ran larger than expected.  More of a men‚Äôs x-large than a women‚Äôs
4.0,Ya las he probado antes... es la segunda vez que las compro y si siento que son de ayuda
4.0,Beautiful dress I get lots of compliments. Runs a little big.
4.0,It's a bit long for a back pocket but otherwise excellent for holding all kinds of cards.
4.0,Great little coat but a little small i would order a size up. Very warm and comfortable. Looks nice too
4.0,Looking forward to the usage of these hoping for no allergic reactions and good wearing without damage or discoloring..<br />THE SIZES of the hooks ARE CONSISTENT AND SEEMINGLY THEY ARE NOT too Flimsy or unbendable.  I read reviews and grabbed these... thank u for quick arrival I'm anxious to begin my earrings.
4.0,nice price and nice tie.
4.0,"I got this as a gift in 2009 and I think it is a very good wallet, the brown leather is very good and the inlay is well crafted, the problem is that with extensive use and putting in the back pocket the leather started to lose it color specially on the edges and thats normal for a leather wallet, only thought it would be a more hard worker one, but it is a good one after all."
4.0,"Fits really well and really comfortably, dedinitely can't wear it as a one piece like some of the other smocked versions. I do like how thick the material is but the hobo in me wishes they had a softer version.<br /><br />I guess my one qualm with this is that, sometimes when I walk, it's like the crotch doesn't know where to go. Sometimes it flops back and forth awkwardly in the front or it flops back and forth awkwardly in the back.... I wanna say it's better when it flops in the back because then it's just like a tail but really, no floppage is preferred. I don't know if it's the fit or the fabric or if that's just how it is but it makes me self conscious haha.  Other than that, I love it. ;P"
4.0,"I really love using these bands so far! The lightest one snapped pretty quickly, but I can still use it. I‚Äôll probably be buying at least two more sets since they‚Äôre so cheap. That way, I can have one for travel, one for my gym bag and one for the home."
4.0,"El vestido es de excelente calidad , pero la parte de los hombros viene un poco estrecha ... y la manga de el vestido muy pero muy apretada ."
4.0,"Feels great, but appearance not like the advertisement photo.  Light weight, comfortable."
4.0,"Provides good structural support for my arches, but not terribly comfortable in the ball of foot or heel."
4.0,"I won't send them back because I will use them, but they are thin, and run a bit small. Not uncomfortable small, just doesn't seem quite on the mark for the sizing for this brand. I have others from this brand that fit much better. I will not be using it in the winter (Michigan), but will be fine for the spring and fall with a long sweatshirt."
4.0,Arrived late but comfy
4.0,Colors aren‚Äôt as vibrant in person but the earrings are fun and well priced.
4.0,Light weight and easy. Narrow fit and fairly long for any neck or faith.
4.0,"I was looking for something cute for my daughter (9), I got her size 32a the bras are cute, they fit around her and easy adjust the straps but she needed a smaller cup, I was trying to buy them as a training bra and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs quite this size yet but definitely will use them when the time comes, great price for 4"
4.0,The fabric is a little to thin but it looks really cute on. I love the sleeves.
4.0,Got it for my baby shower. Loved it.
4.0,"Love this shirt!  Sleeve style covers &#34;fat&#34; arms, and cinching on the sides is slimming."
4.0,The design is super cool. The 3d/color thing is awesome.  But the wallet for me was too small; too tight when you open it to get into your items. Luckily the seller offered refund (which is why 4 stars)
4.0,LOVE LOVE THIS WATCH.... Got so many compliments but after about a year the watched coating faded.
4.0,Love it just as it looks in the photo.
4.0,Love it! Love it!  4 stars because the pic makes the birds look red actual color pink.  Just not a pink kinda girl however I love them enough to wear them anyway.
4.0,Workmanship could have been better.  I had to rip some of the edging off and still need to reattach it because of the sewing.
4.0,It does what it‚Äôs supposed to.
4.0,I love the way this gaiter feels and looks.  The only downsize is that it's a little big for my head so it tends to slide down.
4.0,I do love the leggings. They‚Äôre really comfortable and easy to move in but they are see through!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:543ab2874ae89d2b0b121c8ec5e5dadd]] it‚Äôs cool
4.0,"It could be a tad bigger, but otherwise fine; I really like the filter pocket."
4.0,This Pendant was a gift to a family member. Name is Rose & has a black cat. Perfect!
4.0,"This is a solid plain tee shirt and it gets the job done. The pink is subtle, not over-the-top. The stitching is well-done and I haven't seen any depreciation in it over a few washes. I would recommend it.<br /><br />My only issue is that there is a strange seam in the middle of the back of the shirt. Like, instead of coming together under the arm pit, it connects in the back. I haven't noticed any discomfort or anything, but it is just a little bit different."
4.0,I like this billfold. It's very utilitarian. Not really sure if this is a genuine leather.
4.0,It's ok maybe for a young child .for sn adult it may seem cheap.but it's pretty from far away
4.0,ALSO LOOK SMALLER THEN WHAT I SAW ON THE INTERNET PAGE....BUT THEY ARE ALRIGHT FOR THE PRICE....
4.0,"Fit nicely, but the color was more of an off-white."
4.0,Not american size
4.0,"I love everything about this bag. I am a nursing student and have lots of books and binders to carry in addition to my laptop (Apple iBook.) On a day with a heavy work load I can usually carry three books, each about 1.5 inches thick, as well as three 1 inch binders, all at one time. There is also plenty of compartment storage for everything from pencils to calculators. I especially like the clip located inside one of the pockets so that you can attach your keys to avoid them getting lost in your bag. I do wish there was more padding in the back so heavy loads weren't felt as much. I don't have problems with the straps slipping off, although the material on the inside of the strap is a little smoother than that of my other backpacks. Overall, you can't beat the price of this pack for the amount of space you get. I would definately buy another if the need arose."
4.0,WAITING FOR MY ARRIVAL
4.0,"COLOR IS BRIGHTER THAN PICTURE. BLUE IS REALLY BRIGHT BLUE.  MATERIAL IS THIN (LIKE A T-SHIRT). IT HOLDS YOUR HAIR OK.  HOLD IS NOT AS STRONG AS YOU THINK, BUT I LIKE IT IS LIGHT AND SOFT, SO YOU DO NOT FEEL IT."
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, but the red balls in them aren't very visible from afar."
4.0,Fits a little small but its a well made garment that I enjoy wearing with leggings. Its very warm.
4.0,Its okay with the styling but the dress itself does nothing for me.  I probably won't wear it often.
4.0,"Best sock I know of to date.<br />The new one's are not cotton and grow less stuff. Keeps your feet healthier.<br />The moisture doesn't build. However somewhat thinner or not as much cushion as the good cotton one's which I miss.<br />Dryer feet but not as cushioned and made from different material. Also, wish they had colors or something because I hate marking and matching them with white pen cloth marker but does do the trick."
4.0,Love the look. Makes my cuffs pop.
4.0,"you cant beat the price, quality ,beautiful feel and colors. But I am a size 4 in which I ordered the smell ,I was so disappointed when I tried it on way way to small,,,i was going to reorder in a large that's how small it was ..I did reorder in a med .love it cant wait for it to come in which the delivery cant be beat either ,thank you Amazon."
4.0,"Nice shoes, but they run a size larger. Order size 2 and it was way to big compared to the other size 2 shoes I ordered. Ordered second pair a size smaller and fit just right. Rugged shoes that seem will last for a while."
4.0,"Glasses are fine, except one little detail, I ordered purple glasses and received multi color with all colors in a world except purple, not returning the glasses, just saying"
4.0,"Being a full-size woman, I was a little nervous about whether this would fit. Although a little snug, not enough to worry about. I like the style, color and it's comfortable. I would definitely recommend this top."
4.0,"I bought this specifically for use with the new Big Agnes SLX tent mattress (which exact fits the Copper Spur 2-man tent).<br /><br />Stretches on quick and although it is a 78"" mattress it works well with this 72"" bag spec.  Big Agnes said the Dream Island sleeping BAG has the length but is a little loose since it's not a tapered and elastic design.  Zippers and snaps work as advertised.  Just got this and only tried this out on my bed so far--way too hot for indoor use with pad.  Feels like this will make an awesome comforter though and is perfect for car camping/glamping.<br /><br />Edit: removed 1 star.  Zippers are constantly getting stuck. Pretty small as well. Still happy overall though"
4.0,"Super soft cotton on these socks and they do not constrict on the calves.  They wash well, too.  For me they were a little too generous in the toe box - some of my tighter shoes do not fit over them"
4.0,Good 4 $
4.0,"buttons are attached in the most secure way,afriad I will probably end up losing a button but it fits fine can't complain for the price. Its worth it"
4.0,Just what I expected.  Good quality
4.0,"Item was purchased for a 10 year old, participating in Salvation Army Adapt a Family, team building event at work"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d5b1725c2c5650a790be873aec78b198]] Me encanto aunq es delgada la cadena y se mira algo sencillo pero esta hermosa las medallas
4.0,"Cute dress, looks good in person. I bought this for my mom she normally wears a large so I ordered her a large. She said it fits but it's a little tight in arms up top. She said she can make it work but an XL would probably fit more comfortable. So one size up is probably a good idea. It was a little bit short too, so a bigger size might help with that also."
4.0,For some reason any dark pants I order fit a bit too small.  But the same size in a light color usually fit well.
4.0,Good cheap hoodie for work
4.0,"Beautful watch, but I was expecting a screw down crown. It had a push pull crown. The return and credit were quick and painless."
4.0,Fits nicely and looks good. Other vets notice it.
4.0,"When I opened the bag I was not so sure. The material is odd. It‚Äôs not soft but it has a fair amount of stretch to it. It just felt weird.<br />I actually really liked it on though. The color is more peach than khaki, but the fit is flattering. Overall I‚Äôm happy with it."
4.0,"I'm not completely in love with these shorts. They run large in my opinion. So even when I have the drawstring pulled as tight as I can get it, they still sit low. They look rather boxy on me. But please take that boxy statement with a grain of salt, because my hips are small and my butt is very flat.<br />It's too bad too, because besides the fit, I have nothing bad to say about these shorts.  I was impressed with the material. The fabric was soft, thick, and super comfy. The shorts feel really well made too. I didn't find any loose threads or stitching that was out of place. And I can't make out my panty lines through these shorts, which is always appreciated.  If you can get the sizing right, I'd highly recommend these shorts. They're super cute!"
4.0,Great quality very similar to natives just they run big.
4.0,goooooodddd
4.0,Cute bag and quick delivery. I thought I was getting a red bag and it is pink. I guess I should have read the reviews. It will work for me though.
4.0,Lovely dress but not a fan of the neckline. Also dress a little tight and short
4.0,Better than I expected. Fit was good. No replacement pins though. Breathable strap.
4.0,It worked for our murder mystery party. I would never wear this to any other event though.
4.0,"Comfy, love the pockets. Color is great."
4.0,"These sweatshirts wear well and do seem to wick away sweat better than many other.  When first ordering I noticed a couple comments regarding size running a little large.  I took that in to consideration and ordered medium.  I'm 5'9&#34; weigh 170 -175 and the medium fits nicely, even after many washings."
4.0,"This shirt is a 3/4 length sleeve, with a low neck, that I got because I thought it would be perfect for summer, autumn, and spring weather. It is nearly tunic length, which means it can also work in both a casual or more dressy setting. The downside, which I didn't realize until after I'd gotten it and worn it, is that the material is heavy, and the shirt can't easily be worn in warmer weather, though that also means it can be worn in even cooler weather than I bought it for.<br /><br />One downside is it comes available in just three colors.  It needs to be in more colors, as many women buy shirts and blouses they like in several different colors, but otherwise a great shirt to add to one's wardrobe."
4.0,The pearls are just the right size but the clasps are small and hard to open.
4.0,"Nothing else to say beyond the title. Came a little bigger than I‚Äôd like but I mean justtttt a tad bit. I wanted it firm fitting but not pressed against my skin. But then one wash and dry and it shrunk tighter than I expected it to given how loose it was before. But I think with a gentle drying and just air drying, that shouldn‚Äôt happen so good luck! Either way, the sweater is soft and very comfy."
4.0,"He wears his apron and hat all the time while helping his dad in the kitchen. He is only 3.5 years old but part of a family who loves to cook and create. This apron is adorable on him. It‚Äôs made of a microfiber or brushed fabric, so very soft. I had been expecting a stiff cotton but was surprised. Maybe that‚Äôs my fault for not reading the description more carefully. It all turned out fine though because he enjoys his soft dinosaur apron, and hat. Any kid who likes dinosaurs, dress up, and cooking would I think."
4.0,"Expands as I do, moves with me, good looking best jeans for price I have ever owned"
4.0,"Looked pretty cool and realistic. Smaller than I expected but that is not a bad thing!<br /><br />My only complaint was that I have a fairly thin septum so the ring came loose and fell off quite easily. It can't really be squeezed tighter, so it isn't one size fits all if you have a really thin or thick Septum."
4.0,"A little too loose for an adult female wrist,  but other details are perfect."
4.0,I purchased a Large as I normally wear a size 12 and it's way too big and pretty long on me at 5'4.  It's beautiful and seems to be decent quality.  I am going to try a smaller size and return the Large.
4.0,Sandal is cushy soft but suportive. One problem the size runs small. Wish I had  gone up a size.
4.0,Loved it! Thanks so much :)
4.0,"very nice piece for the price. it's synthetic i'm sure but it looks great. the beads are the perfect size, not too small if your using for meditation and if using as an accessory it's still lovely.."
4.0,"The knees wherr the cats are, are uncomfortable on the knees. There's no lining between the embroidery and skin.<br />Otherwise very cute and fit my daughter great"
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my nephew. He loves it.
4.0,"Great, water-proof rain jacket! Pros: lightweight, detachable hood, roomy hood, cute lining, folds up into a tiny little pouch so it's great for sightseeing and travel, cuts the wind, fairly warm as it is a non-breathable fabric. Cons: pockets don't zip closed so they will fill up with water if you're out in a steady rain storm, non-adjustable cuffs and hem, no lining. Overall: if you're looking for an inexpensive no-frills rain jacket, this works perfectly. I especially liked that it took up so little room in my suitcase and backpack when I was traveling. It's somewhat fitted, so if you want to wear a sweater under it, then size up."
4.0,Super cute! I bought this for my friends birthday and she loved it!
4.0,"This watch is classic, even though it‚Äôs smaller than I expected. I bought it for my mom and she complains she can‚Äôt see the time hands and figures, except with lenses. But she likes it."
4.0,It is a little big but still ok!
4.0,Great for mud runs!
4.0,Adorable but... They did come smelling funny. I left them on the porch to air out and a day or two later the smell disappeared. The sizing is off. I ordered a size 6 and my older daughter who normally wears a size 9 or 10 in the same shoe company fits into them. I‚Äôll save them for when my younger daughter can wear them. Very cute though.
4.0,"This a light fairly comfortable walking and light hiking shoe that is better adapted for walking on unpaved surfaces. I used it on paved city streets and sidewalks and the sole tended to ""hang up"" once in a while and a little more padding would have been nice."
4.0,Thought was a reL robe not a Halloween costume
4.0,"Love the various sizes. The colors are not vibrant but more subtle. I have super sensitive ears and I‚Äôve been able to wear these for days at a time with no issues. The only drawback...the packaging only includes a few pairs of backs that come in a plastic baggie. This may not be an issue for some but for those of you who lose earrings and backs like they are bobby pins, this can be a bit of an issue."
4.0,The boot size tight
4.0,"The prong or whatever that goes into the holes on the band feels like a cheap plastic that'll break easy, but otherwise i'm happy with it. Should be a nice addition to Pride."
4.0,Nice dress. Fabric is a little thin but doesn't need a slip. Perfect for a warm summer day.
4.0,I normally wear a men's 9 and noticed the description said they run small so I ordered a 10 which fits just fine.  These appear to be good quality for the price point. They are very warm which is great for winter use or popping outside.
4.0,Great tote. Only got 4 stars because it smelled bad
4.0,Not perfect condition.
4.0,"Great collect add! Be warned, the earrings come in different sizes and lengths. But true sequin accents."
4.0,"I'm really tall, and this was just long enough to wear as a cover-up, which is what I was looking for. Decent quality."
4.0,The first product sent to me was the wrong one but it was cleared up quickly.
4.0,My wife ordered these for her smart watch. She loved them but had to order new ones because the seams are falling apart.
4.0,Fits and looks great!  Very flattering.  Takes a minute to adjust and get to look right but once on it stays in place.  It's comfortable and fashionable.  A great purchase!
4.0,Had to glue the plastic stone back in but has been in ever since.eventually the black on the sides rubs away however is still on my finger to this day and at the price I paid for it I can't complain.
4.0,Pretty nice for formal wear
4.0,I described the product fit as &#34;fit as expected&#34;. My husband is 6'1&#34; and he was surprised how long the pants were. He ordered the large. The waistband fits at the natural waist....not below waist like most men's jeans today.
4.0,I will eventually fit into this.
4.0,"My granddaughter loved it.  I thought it would be smaller, but she's happy with it and it's really cute"
4.0,"Solid and nice looking; however the white area in between the CZ almost looked like tape on close inspection. However, for my purposes, since the price was reasonable; I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry if lost on a trip etc-"
4.0,"Broke fairly fast, the ring's jewel fell out after about the fourth wear. Worth the price."
4.0,Very nice light weight hat
4.0,Was smaller then I thought it would be. It barley fits on my arm which is around 7&#34; wrist.It works fine and no problem except it is small
4.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful high quality purse, great materials.... and then there‚Äôs this really weird ugly surgical or construction type hose material for the over the shoulder strap. It looks out of place, it‚Äôs weird, ugly, and doesn‚Äôt belong on this lovely bag."
4.0,This is a really adorable set. Only problem is that the one size for top and bottom doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly (maybe it‚Äôs just my body?). Only way to make better would be to specify sizes for each top and bottom!
4.0,"Absolutely delightfully cute. Perfect size. The blue and silver of the turtle are really quite attractive. The box link chain far exceeds what we thought we were going to get.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how well this holds up (as far as tarnishing goes, etc.). One problem already encountered: a literal weak link. There are two circular pieces of jewelry wire link at both ends and they are far less robust than either the main chain or the link extenders. One of them was improperly cut and formed so that a) there is a burr and b) it is out-of-round (see photo). Our fear is that during a day's wear these ""links"" will pull apart and we'll lose the necklace. We'll see, I guess.<br /><br />Our only other comment regards price. There isn't one yet (shows as ""unavailable"" at the time of this review). A reasonable price keeps this at ""4 stars"" (or better) while an unreasonable one would have us lowering the rating to ""3 stars."" Again, we'll see.<br /><br />Until then, 4 stars. Worth one's strong consideration!"
4.0,I buy these for work and have them embroidered with company logo. Nike polos look good and more professional than most knit or weave polos. Wish Nike would make tall sizes already
4.0,They are comfortable to wear and the tint shows up the fairways better than normal shades.
4.0,I love this bag. It was exactly what I expected from the pictures
4.0,"This is very cool, but the design can be improved.  It's obviously made by people with really small wrists.  Some brave skinny entrepreneurs!  But come on guys!!! Did you test this product other then yourselves? My wrists are not even that big at all!  I am only able to use ONE of the bracelet buttons, and it comes off really easily.  The strap needs to be longer so that I can use two of the buttons to hold it.  It's a bit embarrassing when it falls off in public and you have to pick it up from the ground.  So though I love it and I still ware it, the design could be much improved if I was able to use two of the buttons.  One is NOT enough to hold it all day unless your arm is stuck to a table and you don't move much.  I'm going to find a way to use it though cuz I like it, so maybe a pin will do the trick or tightening up the snap buttons or something.  If you have skinny wrists, its perfect.  Please owners of this get it together and I'll buy another."
4.0,"So, for the price and the quality, I will give it 4 stars. The pattern is GORGEOUS and the material is soft! I have had such comfy sleeps in this. But there are a few things buyers should know.<br />One, this is *not* silk; it is polyester and even says so on the garments. I knew this was likely since silk does not exist for 40 dollars, but honestly, I find this comfier and softer than my real silk bathrobe. Just be aware that ""satin"" refers to ""weave"" (stitching) and not material!<br />Two, the sizing is a bit weird. I am 5'4"" 125lbs, and I got a medium, and I am very glad that I sized up! Primarily because the elastic on the waistband of the pants and shorts is tight (though it does stretch a lot). The cami may also be a little tight for those who are bustier (I am a C cup, and it was fine, but those who are much larger should definitely size up). The long-sleeve shirt though was super roomy but still cute.<br />Third, there is no eye mask, which you can see in the picture. There is a scrunchie (for your hair; very cute!), but what they call an 'eye mask' is definitely a garter strap... which is sexy, but maybe worth removing from the package before you give to any teenagers!<br />Overall, a lovely pj set that I definitely recommend, but size up! It's comfier anyway to do so. The pattern is unlike anything else I saw on amazon. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Cute small but yet still have enough pocket to hold many cards. The only con is that you can not fit everything you want inside, it may get hard to close when fully packed. But still love it anyway!"
4.0,Chain came in knots
4.0,"The small fits great! I usually wear a 6 in women‚Äôs. As others have said the hem of the skirt isn‚Äôt finished. I am ok with this b4cause of the type of fabric, I just wish they would have cut straight."
4.0,"Great quality, but too small. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and offered the XL and that was still not long enough."
4.0,I ordered this shirt for my 12 year old daughter Nice fit true to size. We ordered size small
4.0,Good goggles marred by poor earplugs they seems to be single size fits nobody.
4.0,"This is a very nice compact umbrella that one can keep in a bag, purse or in a vehicle. Works great when it gets wet."
4.0,My wife is pretty particular about her clothing but this year i hit every wish on her wishlist. She actually needed some new tights but was dredging dealing with the Christmas rush so saved her and i alot of time and energy.
4.0,Wears okay
4.0,"Like the fit, comfort, and warmth."
4.0,"The tshirt is silkscreen, basic. But I should have expect something of this sort since it was cheap."
4.0,I bought this shoes for my daughter with the idea of a weekend polo wear. When she saw them she loved it so much. She loves the shoes!!
4.0,Easy to adjust and use. Should last a long time.
4.0,Good and comfortable but a little large. Recommend ordering a size smaller than usual.
4.0,"Nice looking pants, especially for the price  I also liked the color for fall"
4.0,I like this for the functionality but it's not quite as pretty as its leather counterparts.
4.0,I got lots of compliments on this Janet Jackson shirt. This is one of my fav shirts. I love it. It doesn't fade or shrink when you wash it. I do wish the pic was front and back but it's not. If you are a big Janet fans as me you will love this shirt.
4.0,"The only thing I don't like about these pants is the upper waist band part is a little too tight. I'm small, 5'3"" 115lbs & my stomach is pretty flat. I've had 4 c-sections so I love high waisted yoga pants but I guess I got spoiled with Victoria secret yoga pants."
4.0,runs a little small but looks great.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this coat. I've been looking for a light trench coat for a while, one that has kind of a classy Audrey Hepburn style. Thankfully, I found it with this coat.<br />I usually buy a small in women's clothing, so I got the Small (Asia size Large). It fits very comfortably. The arms run somewhat small but is still comfortable. It shipped and arrived days before it was expected to, which made me very happy. It's the perfect length, it reaches the mid-thigh. Some of the other reviews said that some of the buttons had loose thread, but it was not the case with me. Very well made for a great price.<br />I also find the jacket to be very slimming, and would look great with a dress underneath. The perfect jacket for a rainy Spring day. I highly recommend this product!"
4.0,"Much darker tinting than I had expected, which is fine for very bright sunlight when outdoors, but seemed a little too dark for driving and partly sunny conditions.  Despite claiming it is made out of magnesium, the sunglasses are fairly heavy."
4.0,My 8 year old loves it.  Good product for the price.
4.0,"Cute, but the two bands didn't stretch like the rest of the tights and made them a little uncomfortable."
4.0,I like them. I do look like a skier instead of a scientists. I was going for the latter.
4.0,"LIUMILAC Women Halter Vneck Ruched Swimwear One Piece Tummy Control Bathing Suit<br /><br />No pictures in this one! The suit is SUPER LONG in the crotch area. Not that the legs are so high cut but that is part of the issue too. The suit is lined in the front. The material could be a bit thicker as the front that isn't roused allows body part shapes to be a little too apparent for me! Maybe if I would of ordered a medium it might be a different fit. But for reference, I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs and for the suit to hit on the body in the correct location, I would need to shorten the crotch area by 2"". I have other suits in a large and did not have this problem. So it just could be the cut. Not for me! I really liked it too! Hope you found this review helpful!"
4.0,Cute top for the price! It's not the best material but that's what I would expect. I get lots of compliments on this. I will say that if you have a big mid section or hips this might not work. It's a bit tighter at the bottom hem.
4.0,Perfect for the wedding I attended this summer.  I do however wish there was a &#34;petite&#34; option for maxi dresses.  I don't do heels and I'm always tripping over maxis.
4.0,"Really like these. Very light weight.  Did not realize back was not Same as front, back is concave and not shiny.  that was disappointing.  Overall still happy with them as from front very pretty and super light weight"
4.0,"A great pair of sterling studs, bezel set with CZs... the size of these earrings is perfect - makes them look believable and suitable for dress or casual. A great value at this price point."
4.0,"I am wearing this pendant on my own 10K yellow gold chain but it is certainly much smaller than I anticipated.  However, it does go well with the 3 ct yellow gold CZ earrings I also purchased from Amazon.  Because I have had several compliments on both, I will continue to wear them until a stone pops out of one of them.  I have never had that happen and hope it never does though.  These seem to be very secure in their settings.<br /><br />Barb Mayer"
4.0,"Not too bad for $6. A little bent up when I received them, but for $6.00 they're a deal. They look good, they fit well. Satisfied.<br />I'd buy again."
4.0,"Very nice product. Normal fabric for button downs. Only issue is it it not made for tall people. I thought getting a size bigger would give me longer sleeves. I'm 6'2&#34; 170lbs. I'm not big, just lengthy. I end up rolling my sleeves above my elbow to make it work."
4.0,They fit kinda is strange or the clear frame might be the issue... But they are built nice and came fast...ummm came with a hard and soft case ...but I think if I tried them at a store I wouldn't have bought them because of fit...
4.0,I love them. They are cute and feel great. The fit is weird. I ordered a size up. They fit my legs tight but it is too big in the waist. I have to keep pulling them up while I work out.
4.0,Above average
4.0,Bought these for my 91 year old Mom so she could just have jammie days..  These are comfy.  I ordered two pairs.  The kitty ones are different material and a better fit.  The ruffle ones have an odd ratio between the arm holes and torso.  So the kitty ones would be 5 stars and the ruffle tie dye ones would be 2 stars.
4.0,The quality is cheap
4.0,Great option to leather earrings!
4.0,Great for the price. Both the quality and fit are true. I recommend these gloves.
4.0,No ball support.
4.0,"A little barrier for a passport, but it will accommodate them.  Great for cellphones, drivers licenses, cash, boarding passes etc."
4.0,"Have worn different earrings, most of them gave my sensitive ears problems, so far no problems or sensitivity.  They look good and feel good."
4.0,Very sexy. It is a little sheer but it's still perfect! Definitely recommend!
4.0,Love this swim suit! Fits perfect.
4.0,arrived on time and had the expected results - a smiling wife.  These are quality items and are very well made - not overly priced and seem to gather complements so makes me happy over and over.
4.0,"Product as described, works well."
4.0,"Very soft, comfy, great color."
4.0,"Know someone who loves foxes? This is the perfect gift for them. Not only is it as cute as it looks, it's cuddly and comfortable too. The fabric is soft to the touch and highly breathable, making it a great addition to outfits all year-round. One thing to look out for is that the stitching is a little crude, although it's not aesthetically noticeable. Also, be careful when you wear jewellery with this scarf as its threads are a little prone to getting snagged."
4.0,"Very comfortable, looks good and well made. The lenses are easy to replace and it has a nice case to hold lenses and glasses. I use polarized lenses for kayaking and other ones for biking and both are great for those proposes.  Very nice for the price."
4.0,Soo i always ordered jeans and chinos from here this is the 1st time i tried the color pants and what a huge difference in sizes. The jeans and chinos fit perfectly but these i couldnt even fit 1 leg in and i took it in size up.<br /><br />Edit: i love that the company quickly responded to my order problem and refunded me the money. Thats what good buisness it about. Thank you. Im still gonna order stuff from ypu guys cause i had more luck than bad luck with your items. I hope you guys have more products tho
4.0,Did not like no directions for the mystery parts included which i think are to make the band smaller or bigger. No instructions on how to use.<br />Watch is great and very pretty. But too big and not sure how to fix that.
4.0,Not but lifting at all but looks like the picture
4.0,"Hubby loves these. He sported these all in Mexico. Not for everyday wear, as they are see through."
4.0,The beads are red not orange. To bad the p<br />rice went up or I would of bought more.<br />Otherwise  they are very nice
4.0,Lightweight neck gaiter. Comes in an 8 pack. Two of each color. Made well. Fit well. Breathable. Can be used in many ways. Very versatile.
4.0,These glass where a great buy and super cute. I will be purchasing more sunglasses from this seller.
4.0,It's been pretty good so far. Looks a bit cheap tho
4.0,I ordered a size up and it's pretty good.
4.0,Lightweight flowy runs a little big
4.0,"Beautiful coat, but the fur is not as full as pictured."
4.0,"Material is ok, cut (style) and color are gorgeous.<br />Only downfall is the sewing it's a little too cheap in my opinion, paying $25 for a dress sewing must be better, the thread keeps coming off especially on the bottom of the dress. Haven't washed it yet, but I feel I MUST hand wash it."
4.0,So soft and stretchy which I love!!! Want to order in another color:)
4.0,Materials and construction are fine. The adjustment strap is just OK. It is all synthetic material with no stretch. Getting a good fit takes some adjusting and it tends to loosen up over time. A bit too big but that has more to do with my really small head than the hat itself.
4.0,"It's super cute, but definitely not for plus-sized girls... it's very soft, and swimsuit-like material so its stretchy and slinky. I'm a 38DD, 16 dress size for reference. I dwarf this thing, haha."
4.0,"I bought this set and another, more expensive one. I'm having a difficult time deciding which one is better. My actual ring size is 6.5, but I ordered a 7. It's slightly too big , but I think I'll keep them both and see which one holds up the best. This is a beautiful set , for the price ,you can't go wrong!"
4.0,"Esta bonito , compr√© una talla m√°s grande por si acaso ."
4.0,Cute and roomy summer bag!
4.0,"this was exactly what I was looking for!!! it fits me perfectly and best of all it fits my 6-year-old son, too."
4.0,Brightens some with brown shade
4.0,Pros:Super Comfortable out of the gate. No need to break In. Does what it says on the tin.<br />Con: Sole is too soft to wear on a roof.  Hubby has to switch out to another pair on roof day.<br />Will update at a later date as we've only had a few weeks.
4.0,Good quality. A bit larger than I imagined.
4.0,While this was a little bigger than I expected my girlfriend gets compliments on it all the time!
4.0,"Thought it would be a bit smaller. I got it for a 4 year old, and it would probably fit my 10 year old better. (She is a bit old for it, though)<br />The ponytail was a bit messy, but I sprayed it with a little fabric softener/water solution and it combed out &#34;OK&#34;"
4.0,good product<br />my son wears these with work boots and loves them
4.0,"just too big, suit made well"
4.0,Material is a bit thinner than expected for the price point.  But can deal with it due to a hard to find color.
4.0,Good quality - would order again
4.0,I was a little skeptical since they were a lot smaller than I anticipated. But after figuring out how and what to put inside they worked great as a quick party favor. It took about 8-9 before I realized how to work these things. Everyone loved them!
4.0,Dress was floor length on me. Its ok but I thought it would be shorter more mid calf length.
4.0,"I thought they would be smaller for some reason. I am a small person so I prefer dainty jewelry, but as the other reviews said, they are pretty and shiny, so I am going to keep them even if I don't end up wearing them in my wedding."
4.0,"IT SEEMS REVIEWS ARE SOMETIMES REQUESTED BEFORE HAVING A GOOD CHANCE TO TRY THE ITEM.  ITEMS LIKE THIS ONE ARE NOT NECESSARILY USED DAILY.  THIS ONE FEELS GOOD, RELATIVELY HEAVY (BUT THAT IS GOOD FOR WEAR).  NOT SURE YET WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT GETS WET, I UNDERSTAND IT MAY DEFORM.  ALSO HAVEN'T YET USED IT FOR WELDING, BUT CERTAINLY WILL KEEP SPARKS OFF THE FRONT OF ME.  DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BURN THROUGH."
4.0,Really cute just made on the small side so size up!  My granddaughter is size 7-8 she is thin and 7 years old!
4.0,"Love the patterns! The only thing I don't like is that the inside pocket was packed out of shape so it has creases that cause bigger things to fall out. Other than that, it's awesome!"
4.0,Works find. just make sure you keep the inserts from the old watch band.
4.0,"I should have sized up. I got a L which is my usual size, but this was a little tight. Nothing extreme but I like a little looser fit. I suppose it's my fault for not taking my measurements beforehand."
4.0,"short handle is hard to slip over wrist to carry on the crook of your arm but the shoulder strap is plenty long, beautiful bag."
4.0,"Didn't realize they were capri style, but other than that, they fit my tall thin 3 year-old and she looks like Michel Phelps lol."
4.0,"Luv the length, definitely mini, perfect with tights or tall boots. Fabric not bad, i only wish the waistline is smaller in size small."
4.0,love it! had t have it hemmed it is very long. I am 5'4&#34; so I had to cut about 2 inches off and still wore 4'  heels and it was almost on the floor.
4.0,I‚Äôm so impressed with the product and packaging!! Comes with a box a little blank notecard and a small dust cloth. Such a great price for this item!
4.0,For the price it‚Äôs beautiful. The only issue I‚Äôve had is that one of the clasps fell off. That said I was able to easily repair that.
4.0,Very cute. Light jacket. True to size.
4.0,Material doesnt have much give and they're made small on the legs
4.0,"Really like to skirt however, the color is more of a ""winter"" white and would have preferred white."
4.0,Love these gloves! The Navy color is great and the style is comfortable!
4.0,Dainty and beautiful
4.0,Very comfy and can be dressed up or casual!
4.0,"Very cute, warm, and comfortable. Only problem is the band the earmuffs are on is very large and not adjustable. If your head is on the smaller side, these may sit too low to even cover your ears. I can pretty much only wear them if I wear my hair up so the band can rest on my ponytail/bun/etc."
4.0,"As described. The only negatives are that the plastic frame is not as sturdy as two other pair that I have and that they are slightly loose on my face, However, I have a smaller face, so they may fit most people."
4.0,"Used it on a Seiko 5. It is very thin and thus looks quite elegant. The holes keep my hand a little cooler and helps cut down perspiration (My hands sweat a lot though). As expected from this kind of leather, the grip is very fit and shall become more comfortable by use.<br />I do not think it will last more than a year. That being said, I have ordered five more."
4.0,I love this watch! Hooked right on to my purse.I gave a 4 star rating because the stem is a little hard to pull out to set the time.
4.0,Just like the photo & as described
4.0,I love the color of the frames. Perfect fit.
4.0,Nice material I'm hard to fit so was concerned about arms /sleeve would hang too longbhich it does but manageable. This runs a little large.
4.0,The dress runs a little large but the material and quality is great. I was looking for a dress my daughter could wear as a costume and dress as she likes to sometimes go out in her play dresses. This worked out perfectly.
4.0,"UPDATE: After writing this the company reached out and refunded the full purchase price, apologizing for the inconvenience. It took them a while but they made it right in the end.<br /><br />‚Äî-<br /><br />Broke after less than 1 year, within warranty. Company sent me a replacement in the wrong color and then refused to replace in the same color I ordered originally. Not well made and company doesn‚Äôt back up their products."
4.0,"What a pretty dress with the contrast piping around the waist. It fit me very well. I found the lace on the front wasn't centered, and it looked odd. I am a seamstress, so I know about centering the pattern. Unfortunately I returned it."
4.0,"It beautiful, however, too large for a gift for a little girl"
4.0,"I liked these, I gave em as a gift, but they are like easy to misplace"
4.0,It's pretty and looks good on. Another buyer posted it's hard to get open (if you know Alex & Ani bracelet functionality) and it is hard but pull as hard as you can it won't break and it looks great with my others!
4.0,"These earrings are adorable! I gave it four stars because one of the stickers fell off during transit, and while I was able to stick it back on, I'm worried it will fall off and I won't notice. Other than that, these are cute earrings that are perfect for any sloth lover![[ASIN:B00GBDNK5M Sloth Face Novelty Dangling Dangle Drop Charm Earrings]]"
4.0,"Nice set, but some are  hard to open."
4.0,I like the way the dress feels and I like the pockets but they start a bit high on my waist making the waistline look proofed out. But it a jacket this is dress is cute.
4.0,I wanted a funky statement necklace for a black dress and this worked very well. It definitely is cheaply made but I still liked the way it looked. Fast shipping.
4.0,This dress is adorable.Just be sure to have some static spray on hand. This thing rode up like crazy. But it was so cute I kind of didn't care.
4.0,"I just love everything about this company. Their jewlery is great quality and if I EVER have a problem NinaQueen goes above and beyond to make it right, a d to fix the problem. NinaQueen is just a GREAT company"
4.0,Bag is great just too big for me and I did not like the cheap look on the sides.
4.0,"The yoga pants from AutumnFall are so soft - like BUTTER! I wear a sz 12 and the XL was very snug. It fits well, but snugger than other similar style pants that I own.<br />They wear comfortably, wash nicely and I love them! I am going to order some more"
4.0,"I love the style. I got a small and its a bit bigger than I expected it to be, however I am super glad they didn't have any mediiums available when I ordered, since that would've been way to big. The pink is peachier than I though it was going to but, but i stll love it. Looks good just as the model styled it, and I'm planning to wear it with a white dress. I love this jacket, it was exactly what I wanted."
4.0,They fit well but the dimensions given are just a tad on the small side.
4.0,"Fit as expected for Asian sizes so remember to order a size or two up.  Thin material, not very soft, and you might want to wear a slip or something underneath.  Very cute dress wore it to my best friends wedding as her Maid of Honor with a pair of over the knee boots.  Looked awesome and had so many compliments"
4.0,The sneaker has very cushiony soul. I actually need more of a molded soul. So I do wear them at work and around the house. But they are great from me to run or workout in
4.0,"Very pretty, large and with lots of room. Lightweight and soft. Showed signs of wear pretty quickly"
4.0,These are very light and very flat. Just what I was wanting. They don‚Äôt wrap around your arch much so a different feel from a barefoot shoe which will hug your arch. Overall though I am a total believer in Xero shoes and boots.
4.0,Great fit and good quality. Not overly loose or tight. Perfect fit.
4.0,These are comfortable and warm. They seem to run a bit small.
4.0,Larger than expected.. I don't carry it much but still love it!!
4.0,"Very attractive.Looks just like photo. Fit well and stretches. Reaches above ankles. I'm assuming if  you're feet are size 10.5 and over, you probably will have a problem.<br />The mesh part, covering the instep is not the same color as the sock - it is white, no matter what color you purchase."
4.0,"My daughter likes them, but they run larger than her other toms. I like that the toe area does not get torn because of the rubber front."
4.0,They‚Äôre a little large and I followed the sizing chart. I still really like them for lounging around the house and light exercise! Not bad at all for the price
4.0,"This is well appreciated by my granddaughter .. we wash it several times and the fit stays the same, the glitters intact<br /><br />The hems may not be perfect but the kids dont care :) thats why 4 star"
4.0,Want left one
4.0,"Great glasses for the price. Have used several times and can tell it cuts down on the glare while staring at my computer all day.  Could just be in my head, but believe they work... and bonus they are cute on."
4.0,Fuzzys everywhere üò≥ But very warm and big!
4.0,Nice light weight shrug.
4.0,This was not very comfortable. The seams are very rough and the ends are burned. It also kept slipping off my glasses and bunching up. I went to return it and they are going to charge me almost $4 for postage to return!!!<br /><br />==========<br /><br />7/7/2021 UPDATE<br />The company responded very quickly and resolved the issue. I was actually a bit surprised that they responded. I changed it from a one star to a four star review because of the customer service.
4.0,i will eventually stretch them
4.0,"I absolutely love feathers, and knew that I had to get a cute earring for my cartilage piercing on my left ear. It is a very cute earring, but was very hard to get onto my ear. The ball pops off, and the opening that was left for me to slide onto my ear was very tiny. It took about 3 minutes for me to slowly slide the earring through my ear to reach my cartilage piercing, and it was kind of painful, since the metal dug into my ear and grazed it pretty deep... Also, the ball was so small, that after about 10 minutes of trying to pop the hoop into the ball, I accidentally dropped the tiny thing, and lost it. I ended up getting a rubber piercing stopper, and slid that into the hoop. It's really a cute earring, but putting it on was the hardest thing to do."
4.0,"It‚Äôs already been pointed out that this seller is a scammer from another reviewer. Not much to add there. The band I got was okay, but definitely mislead the customers by showing a higher quality product in the pictures."
4.0,My Son loves these shoes and I feel the quality for the price was good !
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; & 128 lbs & ordered a small. I liked the straps which were not scratchy, the cotton fabric (not see through) which makes it comfortable for summer or if you normally sleep hot. The cut under the arms is just right - doesn't hang down too low or come up too high. There's a keyhole slit opening in the center of the top down from the floral applique trim. Not too revealing as it is narrow, only about 3&#34; long, and nice finished stitching. The gown has a loose fit around the middle which is what I wanted because I get too hot when sleeping & don't want gowns that are tight or clingy. What I'm not wild about is the ruffle on the bottom which hits just under my bum when standing, but ON my bum when sitting or getting into bed. Not a deal-breaker, but I'm sorry that it's not just a bit longer. I might have been better off with a medium, but as roomy as it is below the bust line, it might look like 2 pounds of spuds in a 20 pound sack."
4.0,"This is a good dress purchase.... a little short on the torso,but still a good dress"
4.0,pretty cool plugs for sure
4.0,"Basic T shirt, a bit thin, but what I expected for the price. Shipping was a bit slow, but arrived in good condition."
4.0,Need improvement
4.0,I love the color and the fur inside. Only thing I was super disappointed about was that their are NO POCKETS. :( They are sewn shut.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the material of the hat. For he price, I expected something cheap, but this was not the case. It is a very soft material that fits comfortably. Not too tight, not too big.<br />I'm not ecstatic about the way it hangs off the back of the head, because it has a tendency to point up, rather than fold over. That may have something to do with the size. Otherwise, it is a good purchase, and very warm."
4.0,This isn't exactly 18mm so it was difficult to get it to latch properly. The rubber on the edges of the band is lifting off but it still looks fine without it on there. Worth the money and love the colors and patterns.
4.0,"Nice , warm and comfy. A little bit smaller from what  I expected."
4.0,"These bows were everything i was looking for, they look great and they are not to big but best of all they do not leave marks on my little ones head. The reason i gave them a 4star is because one of the bows came stretched out and it will not fit my baby girl until maybe 12months or more  but other than that the rest of the bows were in great condition"
4.0,"The material on this Henley is superb...soft and the color is as I expected.  There was only one thing strange.  There were no tiny pockets on my shirt.  I got it larger than needed on purpose.  i am 5'7&#34; but most things I have ordered are so tight, I got both of these XXL..have reordered them in different colors but ordered a smaller size.(L) Again...the material is lovely...not the ribbed type, but smooth....!!!"
4.0,"I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is as pictured. The material kind of reminds me of swimsuit material, which is fine. I wear it with jean shorts and it looks cute! Buy accordingly to the chart. I am 5'5 135 lbs. It is stretchy and the tie string helps it conform to your body. If you like sexy, you'll like this!"
4.0,"These are rather thin, but that is what we wanted.  We wanted them because my husband has difficulty getting up out of a chair, especially on a floor without carpet, and the tread on the socks keeps him from slipping while getting up and while walking.  They work well for this, but we could have used a larger size."
4.0,"For panty wearing guys, it is always tough to find thongs with enough room up front to accommodate our addition equipment.  These do that fairly well.  They definitely aren't great.  I am a little above average"
4.0,very lovely and well made. it‚Äôs just a little small for a 7/1/2. it‚Äôs barley fits but it‚Äôs fine. love it!!  had to return to small cut into my wrist
4.0,It is bigger than I expected but I like it.
4.0,"Very cute and good quality. However, I got this as a gift for my mom who always wears a 2x no problem, and it was too small. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt go up a size because they offer only up to 2x. My mom says she‚Äôll keep it and try to stretch it out, so we‚Äôll see. For everyone else I would recommend going at least 1 size up."
4.0,"nice shirt, soft material, little smaller than I expected"
4.0,Really pretty and nice flattering cut but go by the Amazon recommended size. My measurements are 38/30/38 and I ordered Med.  Amazon recommended small and they were right!  Med was way too big...standing out under my arms. Will exchange for small.
4.0,Like it.  Sturdy.  Light.  My hands bother me and this doesn't make them hurt to carry it.  I use it for my back in the car since I have to sit perfectly straight for my neck.  Also I use it for seating at events because I have a bony butt  and this is great.  It's a little hard like some said but that's fine for me  My husband bought one from Duck's sporting goods  and the only reason his is better is befit has an extra strap that goes across the back and is nicer for carrying.
4.0,"Just so cheesy and yet I still love it. Not particularly soft on the inside, and it isn't especially thick, but I'm wearing it for overnight shifts on a construction site in a relatively temperate climate so very soft things are at more risk of tearing and I don't need to worry about freezing temperatures. I love the porgs."
4.0,Nice size of rocks.
4.0,Quality very good.. But a little smaller than most larges.
4.0,I ordered a medium and the bottom fits great but the top is just a little bit too big. But I love the style and it's so unique! Can't beat the price!
4.0,"Definitely cute for price, the quality isn't the best but I like the look I was going for. I was afraid it coming from China it would fit small, so I got a medium and it was a tad bigger but gave the comfy oversized sweater look. I paired it with a bralette"
4.0,daughter needed
4.0,"Good earrings, a little on the small side but well worth the money and super comfortable for everyday wear. Great size for children ."
4.0,"A little thinner than most, but fits well and looks great."
4.0,"Have only washed and worn once so far, but I love how comfortable these pants are. They are fitted without being skin tight and the high waist doesn't cut into me. As a 5'8"" woman with long legs, the inseam is perfect! The pockets are a little lower than I'd like and they need to sew a seam through the waistband so the elastic doesn't roll in on itself, but overall, I like them. If they hold up, I will be buying more."
4.0,Great for sun protection with a t-shirt.
4.0,Sexy ring
4.0,The sleeves of the dress were slightly too short and the zipper likes to get hung in the lace material up top. So be careful with that.. overall my daughter loved it! We purchased it for her chorus spring concert! I will state if you have a larger upper body please go up a size other than that it fit great.. we added our own little belt instead of using the one that came with the dress..
4.0,"The color is a bit darker then the photograph leads a person to believe. But this is very well made, and good for year round use."
4.0,It's a little shorter than I'd like. but overall it's flattering and fits well.
4.0,"I purchased these shoes for my 3yo son to play in. They are very affordable and are decent quality. Nothing fancy, but adequate for running and playing. They arrived quickly and my son is very happy with them. I love that they are Velcro so I don't have to tie them constantly. ;)"
4.0,"I like the overall style and shape of this textured cardigan. The button down style is versatile, and it's a nice transition piece. The fabric is a little itchy for me, but this may improve with more washes. All in all, this is a nice trendy option for the price and looks cute when being worn."
4.0,I bought this for the style and thought the zipper bottom would be useful. It turns out that the zipper feature is can be tricky and hard to close. I stopped sending my son to his grandmothers with this outfit as it was difficult for her to close the zipper and honestly was difficult for me too. Super cute but a bit of work when used.
4.0,"They collect lotion / debris kind of easy, but I also wear them almost every day. Good quality & exactly what I expected"
4.0,Such a cute shirt. The only thing to be aware of is that the sleeves are skinny. So it is impossible for me to roll up my son's sleeves when he is eating. If the child has fat arms it might be a problem.
4.0,"I was expecting a shorter skirt but this one goes past my knees. Still a cute dress, good material."
4.0,The band was too large for the watch that‚Äôs why it was returned
4.0,Pleasant sweater
4.0,Really cute and easy to take on and off. It‚Äôs nice and stretchy as well. The size I bought didn‚Äôt fit perfectly in the slots on my watch so I had extra hanging out of the sides. It didnt bother too much but after wearing for a while the fabric gets dirty and I can‚Äôt figure out how to clean it off.
4.0,Soft and comfortable. I have this dress in several colors. Not crazy about the pockets.
4.0,"The size is both hip and trendy! I like it overall with one small critique, it's really lightweight. I ordered the wrong color but it won't stop me from wearing it. I would buy it again but in the tan color."
4.0,"Soft faux fur keeps my ears warm. Comfortable and good price. Not as comfortable (by a small margin) and compact  (about twice the thickness) as the 180 degree ones, but much cheaper. Would buy these again."
4.0,"This material seemed cheap, but my 16 y/o liked it, and really liked the design. It fit big."
4.0,Yes the feathers were  everywhere but this Boa looked amazing...
4.0,"No way would you ever catch me outside in this! It is so thin, so flimsy. I cannot imagine wearing this as a dress under any circumstances. I'm pretty sure I have used tissues that were thicker. HOWEVER. It makes the cutest nightgown! Fantastic for this unbearable weather we have been having. I bought a Large but I probably could have done with an XL as I expect it to shrink a bit and it's almost, but not quite, tight along my upper back. 5'3, about 140lbs, around 34c and a fairly wide upper back."
4.0,Helps keep my bangs off my face while i sleep.  I wake and hair looks great
4.0,They really do work and fit very comfortably they are good for day and night
4.0,Beautiful bracelet. Looks very well made and the perfect size for my daughter's wrist.
4.0,Soft longer length shirt. Item fits just as described and the colors are bright on lips & bullet! Plan on ordering my Mom one now
4.0,"The fit is great, just wish it were more wrinkle free. That is the only reason it did not get the fifth star."
4.0,They fit a little tighter than I thought. Pretty cute - not amazing quality but works!
4.0,Absolutely love it!! Very comfortable.  Good quality
4.0,The robe is worth the entire purchase. The shirt is super thin. And the pants faded after the first wash. The robe is lush and just worth it.
4.0,"What I expected, but would have preferred a boxed chain.. But I love it!!"
4.0,Wish it came larger sizes
4.0,"A little heavy, but not too bad. Very pretty."
4.0,My sister loved the dress. Good buy for the money.
4.0,"I love the look of these boots.  They are surprisingly comfortable on my feet.  I have an issue wearing anything closed toe, but these did not present any problems for my feet.<br /><br />The only issue that I have is that it took a little work to zip them up and they are a little snug around my calves.  Wish that the size chart provided measurements for calves.  Hopefully they will stretch a little after a few wears.  No regrets with this purchase."
4.0,"Cute, but the material reminds me of curtains."
4.0,Seems like the pink ones are a bit larger than the black and white ones. I used the black ones and they worked perfectly. I had better luck sizing up with these spirals than I did with tapers.
4.0,"Super cute but not the best material. The liner under the tulle Bunched and wrinkled badly after one wash. That being said, my daughter still loves it and wears it all the time and it still looks pretty cute. You just have to keep pulling down the inner liner."
4.0,Item still too small after I ordered the next size up
4.0,"not as elegant as I'd hoped, so they won't work as stand-alone pendants. but they will work to make a station necklace quite nicely"
4.0,"The boots are slightly too big. I am an 8 in women‚Äôs, so I ordered a 6. I wear them every day for work. You absolutely need insoles for them, there‚Äôs nothing out of the box. I bought extra thick insoles to help fill the extra space, and it mostly did the trick. They have held up extremely well! My last pair of boots only lasted a few months before wearing holes into them. These have exceeded that already, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any major signs of wear and tear yet! Very happy with these, would definitely order them again."
4.0,"What I liked the least about Woman's High Neck Cloak Cape, i didn't like the back out. Wasn't aware of the making. Returned the item received my refund. Thank you for the quick refund."
4.0,These are cute. The bottoms fit as expected but the shirt is too short and rides up and won't stay down over the bottoms.
4.0,"It took a long time to receive the masks. They were delivered from LA by DHL, but it seems the masks are made in China. Someone mentioned they are Japanese, but the paper came with the masks was written in Chinese so I guess they are made in China. The quality is actually ok."
4.0,Small but holds everything I need! I love the side pockets for my reading glasses and mini water bottle ‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,I usually take a medium this was way  to small<br />The item itself was really nice.<br />I will return it & probably go up 2 sizes
4.0,Fabric is a bit thick
4.0,"I love this necklace. Came almost two weeks before the arrival date. Charm is a nice size, not too big, perfect size. The chain could be longer but I was able to buy a new chain. Very nice product."
4.0,This is a gift I will be giving.  It looks substantial and well made.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I noticed a few beads seem to be fused together but overeall it is very pretty and should go with any color.
4.0,"It works perfectly with my hunter green Christopher Ward C60 Pro Diver.  It's comfortable, it's sporty, it gets a lot of compliments.  The only thing I would have loved to give it 5 starts is that the strap holders don't stay in place and they require adjustments often."
4.0,This packet is good for storing credit cards and any other cards this size. I carry various badges and this makes it easy to keep them organized. I do wish the hinged top was a little wider to accommodate many cards instead of just a few.
4.0,They are perfect except the shirt alittle too short. Comfortable and warm.
4.0,"I like these because some of them resembled a pair I use to have that were mustard colored. These are not mustard but go well with outfits that are in that color scheme or golds, tan and beige. Very light weight. Not too long. Great for fall, spring and summer. Fun wear or dress up. I may use some as gifts."
4.0,"I always worry when purchasing clothing coming from China. I always read comments about how poorly clothing fits or how much the size is off. So I was nicely surprised that this one actually looks like the picture. Obviously falls straight versus blowing outward like you have a fan blowing on you. It droops down in the back and you tie it around you. That makes it one size and it's more comfortable than elastic. It will stay in place and flows nicely. Happily surprised with the quality and design. My only con giving it the four star is the length, the wrap hits me mid calf and I am five foot eight inches.<br /><br />If my review has helped you in any way please consider clicking 'Yes'. Thanks in advance."
4.0,Great kind of thin but look just like the picture. It very stylish and nice material.
4.0,"The faux leather looks pretty real and doesn't smell funny, but the smallest size is a bit too big on me (0, xs) as well as a tad long (mid-knee for 5'3&#34;). It does also arrive with some big folds/wrinkles and I can only hope the wash will get that out because one cannot iron plastic."
4.0,"These really do keep your feet dry while shoveling or blowing snow. I bought them, however, thinking they'd just slide on. They don't. If you're looking for a simple slip-on boot, I'd look for other options."
4.0,"As far as costumes go, this is on the higher end quality-wise. Fit was a too small around the ribcage; I had to alter it by removing the darts in the back of the dress. Now I can zip it up easily and even have room to wear a thin long sleeve shirt underneath so it‚Äôs work appropriate. Recommend sizing up even if the size chart indicates otherwise."
4.0,Bought for a friend she really like it
4.0,Great all plastic belt
4.0,Loved the size. Cut through fabric and individually wrapped meds easily. I didn't love how the scissors didn't naturally stayed closed. They swung open often inside of my pocket.
4.0,"It seems to be everything that I was looking for short of different pouches for credit cards oh, it has a department for that but not singular. And seems to be nice and lightweight and the material comfortable, I just got it today and it's going with me on my vacation. So I will give you an update when I come back"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bbce9837dc54e7fe7dd43a46e1b1a081]] My only complaint is that the ad says that they feel like Cashmere and they not feel like Cashmere, they feel like cotton/poly blend. The band over the knuckles was initially tight but after wearing them for a little while, like an hour, they became more comfortable. They are a little on the thin side but our warm enough for spring and autumn days."
4.0,Product came promptly and as described.
4.0,"Not Exactly Like Picture On Listing. Not As Blingy Nor Shiny As Picture On Amazon Shows. I Have Tried For 20 Mins To Take Photos Of Multiple Angles and Lighting . Hoping It Will Look Better. Its Dull , Stones Are Tiny Specks . No Bling!  Not Happy Sorry"
4.0,"Colorful, easy to attach to attach to eyeglasses, and comfortable.  The one drawback that I experienced was the tendency for the eyeglasses to slip out even if the loop was securely tightened.  Fortunately this happens on only one side at a time so the eyeglasses could be reattached without damage or loss.  I still continue to use them."
4.0,"Was more orange than red, disappointing! Runs a bit big!"
4.0,"These work great, one of them the snap wouldn‚Äôt work but the other 2 work fine"
4.0,It's a little large on my 14 year old daughter on the shoulders. Very pretty design though. We bought a small and my daughter is tall and slender.
4.0,"Very nice, I love the different color, it is SO pretty.  I get compliments on this.....sturdy, beautiful and nice."
4.0,"These shorts fit well. I wish there was a key pocket, at least. No pockets at all. Did not know g to hat when I bought it. Otherwise...love tjem"
4.0,The pictures actually show a lot of what you can do with these pretty and very silky pants. Loungewear>Dressy. You‚Äôll want to do a lot with them. I like that they have a stretchy waistband with a working tie to adjust.
4.0,I ordered this for me however it was too small for  me.  My daughter did not hesitate taking it off of my hanger.
4.0,"I love how it sits on the chain. The chain isn't the highest quality, but for the price, it's fine. Made for a small person, as it it about 1/2 the size I'd hoped. I do really like it though. Two of these deer would make really cute earrings."
4.0,She is in love with how they fit and how they look when she out Then on. And night I add I like how they fit also.
4.0,"Nice slim wallet. Needed for a small cross body. Wish it had more card slots. But, I just have to adjust. Cards are a little tight to get in and out but for the price I'll make it work."
4.0,It was pretty good! Not the best tho!
4.0,"I'm a 29"" waist and a 40"" hips and these fit great and are squat proof. I got the vital violet/purple color. Only thing i can say is the waist is a little more compressive then I'm used to but it definitely holds you in."
4.0,When the shirt arrived I was pretty excited because it looked better in person than in the picture.  But it was way too small.  I typically wear a large and ordered an XL based on the products reviews.  It was still way too small and had to be returned.  Definitely order up a couple sizes if you'd like it to look on you how it looks in the picture.
4.0,These are too strong for me. I'm not sure what I was thinking and I have someone who can use them so it's not a loss
4.0,Fits my daughter well and looks nice. The only thing I wish was better is the white sleeves and collar are part  of rather than a separate shirt .
4.0,"The fabric is luscious! Soft and just the right weight. The buttons are sweet, but so tiny they can be difficult to use. It's ok on the placket, but I wish the cuff buttons, which get used a lot more, were bigger. Then it would be a 5 star shirt."
4.0,Pants are actually pretty nice for the price.
4.0,Great earrings for the price real sterling silver doesn't irritate my skin will shop again fast shipping  very sparkly and shiney
4.0,Really love this shirt. Bought for my hubby for Christmas and he liked it because of the colors.
4.0,Good quality. Order up in size because reviews said it ran small. It ended up being a little big but dried it in the dryer now it‚Äôs good.
4.0,This dress looks great on! Just don't feel it was proportioned correctly the top was very snug & it was a little roomy on the bottom. I felt the bottom was a fit of a large & the top was a fit of a medium.  Usually wear a 6-8 - ordered a large.
4.0,"granddaughter loves it, necklace a bit long, but I expected that.  All is good"
4.0,"I honestly love these. The compression factor is perfect- they are comfy to wear but help slim. At first they looked impossibly too small, but they stretch easily and I was able to pull them up fresh out of the shower and lotioned up. These do run small so size up. The pockets are all along the waistband. I thought they would come in hand for walks or jogging, but not a single one comfortably held my iPhone. I‚Äôve started wearing these for Pilates or yoga but will bust them out when the weather cools for outside exercise, as the material is a bit thick."
4.0,"This dress is comfortable and figure flattering. Some of the cotton dresses on Amazon made with a similar fabric and style have not fit me due to my busty figure, but the stretchy top to this makes it a breeze to put this on. If anything, the dress could be slightly more fitted and is a little loose (I'm a size 14 and I ordered an XL). I feel confident about how I look while wearing this. The stitching on this is not as high quality as more expensive dresses, but at just under $20 I can't really complain."
4.0,"These fit great. They do not feel awkward and are comfy. I do get how having no seams is different. For some reason,  pants with seams are more flattering and look more like actual pants. But these are cute with a longer shirt.<br />They are not see through.<br />I'm 5'5&#34; about 102 lbs and wear sz 0-2 of 25-26 in pants. I have wide hips and a flat butt. I ordered the XS. The compression is great. I have not worked out in them yet so this review is based on look and fit only."
4.0,"I'm not a fan of the top. The collar does not lay down and the material is not what one would expect from a swimsuit. It cups my breasts very well, so there's no worry that they may fall out or anything like that. I was mostly worried about the bottoms, but they fit pretty decently though slightly tight. Overall, it's pretty cute though."
4.0,Very cute pajamas
4.0,"I used to have a wristlet that was perfect for me.  I loved it and would have used it forever if I hadn't upgraded my phone.  Now I have a Note 5 and it has been really difficult to find something that  does the job.  So far I am really happy with this little wallet.  It fits my phone perfectly even with a case, it holds all my cards, and more.  It could easily hold small items like a lipstick, small compact,  and/or small set of keys.  I love the look, size, and feel.<br /><br />I'm a little concerned about the wrist strap, which seems thin and flimsy.  I'm also not to sure about some of the stitching.<br /><br />It is early to tell for sure how it is going to work out so I will update in a few months or so, good or bad."
4.0,"the item is good but its too small for me, so bring back."
4.0,Good value and pretty good fit but not as good as original lenses
4.0,The Pearl is so very pretty and I am very satisfied.  The butterfly design sets it off beautifully.  The chain is only okay and I will probably replace it because the clasp ring is small and difficult to attach.
4.0,A little difficult to adjust and the clamp does not open quite far enough for some chairs/lounges.
4.0,"I like these sunglasses - I kept them and if you could see how many items I return? (Amazon Prime) you'd be like &#34;Wow, Kat really likes these glasses), that said? They're not perfect here are the pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />Beautiful color to them<br />Good for small faces<br />Great block for sun<br />Good price<br />Stylish - very cute<br />Cons:<br />They tilt a bit up to the right so I have to adjust them<br />They sometimes feel like they have smears on them when I wear them - I feel like I'm seeing smudges but then I clean them and find nothing to clean - I think it might be the reflection back?"
4.0,"Love it, but just one thing, there was this weird yellow inc spots on the top of both necklaces, its a little noticeable but I still love it."
4.0,Much cuter in the photo. The big tie in the back is a little awkward and makes it harder to pair with a jean jacket or cardigan. This would be a great dress for a weekend trip to the beach.
4.0,"Sleeves are tight . It's very very thin , I wouldn't call it a sweater ."
4.0,Very nice quality material and construction.  A little tight for my head but likely fits most women.
4.0,"At first these were pretty stiff and tight coming out of the box.  After about 5 hours of wear in both spin class and on my mountain bike, they've been broken in and fit like a glove.  I wish the soles were maybe a tad bit stiffer, but overall these are a real bargain for an MTB shoe.  I'd definitely recommend, and I'll be buying a second pair for wear in spin class only.  The best part of these is that they're comfortable enough to wear without socks- a real bonus on hot, humid days."
4.0,these are some of the most comfortable flip flops I've ever had.i wish I could give 5 stars but just can't.they get really slippery when you get them wet.your foot tries to slide off.keep them dry and they are near perfect
4.0,"I LOVE this shirt.  I own it in black and in white.  The only things I would change are shorten the back, and a V Neck.  I have washed and worn several times.  Good quality.  Nice price."
4.0,I found the clasp very difficult to adjust and place in the correct position. Otherwise very attractive.
4.0,"Made of thick rubber with steel accent this should be durable. Fits very comfortably. Clasp is secure if a bit challenging to put on by yourself. My only concern/criticism is that the face is so highly polished that any scratch will really stand out. I think, maybe, a brushed steel face would be preferable. Good piece at a good price."
4.0,Very nice for. It is thick for extra protection. Fabric is on the itchy side against the face.
4.0,Love them! Super cute. Definitely worth the $7 I paid for them. Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,I expected a little more from this dress it's pretty but the quality is not the best
4.0,"This watch looks wonderful. It's well-made and works great. The only problem I have is with the band. The band looks great and the locking system works well, but the band isn't easy to adjust. It is very loose for me, so I'll have to take out 4 links to make it fit. Unfortunately, I will need a very small jeweler screwdriver to remove the links. I will probably have to take it to a watch repair shop to remove them."
4.0,Great dress would be 5 stars if zipper wasn't so hard to zip
4.0,Sent back too expensive
4.0,"This absolutely runs large. I purchased a medium and it fits with room to spare. I'm usually an L or XL.<br /><br />It's a cute top. Not super soft, but not crummy and itchy either."
4.0,Nice thick gloves
4.0,"This is another great wallet from Louis Pelle. I like the design of this one quite a lot.  It isn't as thin as I generally prefer when folded and packed with cards and a few folded Bill's, but it's nice and will see use from time to time."
4.0,"This is a very cute cover up that can also be worn as a shirt with a cami under for summer. Slightly short in the front on my 5‚Äô6 thick frame, so I will be wearing shorts but would definitely buy in another color for variety!"
4.0,Birthday gift for oldest grandson good quality
4.0,"Ok, beauty"
4.0,"Good but could be more like a dickey, my chest still gets cold air down shirt"
4.0,"The foot size is long on the large, my wife wears a 9 and still too long.  Overall, the compression stockings are great and very reasonable for what you get.  Do not wash with towels or towel pieces will stick to socks.  I will order every color.  Great for circulation!"
4.0,Pretty cool!! Kind a like it!! :)
4.0,"Love these Doctor Who masks, the lining is soft and doesn't hurt or rub your face. Fit is good. Extra filters can be bought."
4.0,"Update:  They have been in contact with me and want to resolve the situation. My best guess is a smaller size was sent to me by mistake from the amazon warehouse as I ordered it through prime or it could have been packaged wrong.  Quality is pretty good and other than the sizing issue I would suggest this belt as a purchase, especially through Heepliday.<br /><br />Bought this knowing there wasn't a lot of reviews and took a chance. Well it doesn't fit, I always buy a size 42 belt because I conceal carry and my handgun adds 2 inches to my size 39 waist. Even without my holster this thing barely fits my waist and it's marked as being 3 inches larger. Quality seems okay but I will have to return and try a larger size. Will update my review if the replacement is better"
4.0,"This shirt fits relatively small, but I listened to the other reviewers and ordered a size or two up... it IS a junior's size after all, so what can you expect?! Lol why on earth they are making grammy shirts in juniors sizes is beyond me, since I hope there aren't a lot of 13 year old grandmas running around out there... anyways though! My stepmom loved receiving this gift, and it looks great on her. Size up a bit and you will like this one :)"
4.0,Seems to be fair product for price but too small.
4.0,"4 stars for failing the squat test, BUT they are super cute and form fitting. I wear them to the gym on a cardio or ab day. Great staple to have in your gym wardrobe."
4.0,Very cute! Ring part adjusts to fit finger sizes which helps with my fat fingers. It feels a little cheap but great for my costume.
4.0,This is nice not as shiny as you see in picture but it is fancy looking :) i like
4.0,"Love the feel of the fabric, quality and durability"
4.0,"The hat is kinda hot, of course, I live in Arizona."
4.0,Fit great. I just wish the pockets were deeper fit my iPhone securely.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very pretty dress, when you tie the ribbon on the back it‚Äôll tighten up the dress because it‚Äôs a little too big for the size listed. It‚Äôs not as big and poofy as the picture shows which is what I was bummed about. Still very pretty and my daughter and her best friend loved them either way."
4.0,Reason being my size was unavailable so I went a size up from my preference with the mind set of it fitting the same after a wash or two... have'nt washed yet...still enjoyed the purchase
4.0,Very comfortable.  One drawback is that it loosens up over the week.
4.0,I love the ring it's perfect! I tried it on a few fingers before I found the perfect spot!
4.0,This feels pretty good. I now brave the cold winds that assault my face.
4.0,It works just fine under sweaters.
4.0,This earring back fits perfectly on my toddlers earring. I was searching for a universal earring back and this was perfect. Will buy again if she looses the other one
4.0,The shades feel very light on my face and they eliminate most of the glare during the day. They don‚Äôt fit as snug to my face as I‚Äôd like but fit well enough.
4.0,I loved these!! Unfortunately I lost them at Ultra Music Festival I was so sad. The reason I have it four stars is cause it did feel a little flemsy. I thought it wouldn't eventually end up breaking but they were too cute!
4.0,"Not what I expected, but it‚Äôs ok"
4.0,I‚Äôm helping with a wedding & she asked if we could find something comfortable but wedding appropriate that matched the wedding party. It is so comfortable & cute! I think that I will be purchasing the other colors. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 195lbs & usually wear XL but this is a MEDIUM!!!! It fit so good that I could probably fit a small
4.0,"This was a nice beanie but I felt that the band was a bit thick. I don‚Äôt like the beanie over my ears but putting it behind my ears, the thicker band makes it a bit uncomfortable after a while."
4.0,SO CUTE BUT NOT TOO COMFY
4.0,"Nice, but somewhat plain. Decided to exchange it at Bealls in Indian Harbor Beach."
4.0,Fits so well. Gorgeous. Likes to ride up a little. Longer than you'd expect on shorter girls.
4.0,Absolutely love these earings and they do not fall off...
4.0,I bought the for myself and they are very comfortable  and warm in this cold weather we have been having
4.0,Nice bag over all. Wish it was a little bigger on the inside. But very stylish if you are wanting to get away from the cheap looking baby bags.
4.0,The fit was perfect - I got medium and am a size 10-12  and they are very comfy. I don‚Äôt know how they will hold up but for the price I will give them a try.
4.0,I like the feel. Not fond of polys but it fits better than the others I ordered at the same time. Seems like a good brand.
4.0,Super cute! Been looking for one of these for a while to fit in my small purse. Love it!!!
4.0,"I love the pattern Design and colors, though it was much deeper colored and vivid in the photo. Expected it to be heavier weight material, I don't know why, as it was very inexpensive. It does go almost to the floor when in flats and I'm 5'9"". Will go pretty much all the way around me (185 lbs), so there is coverage, but it is NOT going to keep you warm. It flows out nicely in the back when you walk - ooooo, very nice, we like that! Hood is plenty large enough and the cloak has nice flat pleats around the neck instead of being gathered. A big downer for me is that the inside is white, really kinda ruins the effect of a dark cloak. I'm thinking of lining the inside with something warm and black. That would fix warmth and weight and inside color problems - because I REALLY like the colors and pattern and size is very doable. The white backside is really a problem in the hood as it shows terribly on your back when it is down. Three options =  1)tuck it inside if you're not wearing it up (this also shows the back pattern more) . 2) line just the hood ( advantage of keeping your head warm, if your outfit is otherwise warm enough. Also, cheaper/easier than a full lining). 3) try to fold edge back up over itself, pull snug and clip together in front to help secure. Not the best option, kind of hard to achieve cleanly, but will kind of hide the white and show more color and pattern. Otherwise you have a big white glaring hood covering your beautiful cloak. I'm also considering buying a second identical cloak and sewing it in as a liner - great, right! Turn both inside out, stitch around front edge and hood then turn right side out and top stitch the bottom. I kind of want to round off the front corners, so this would finish off the raw cut edges as well. For the price, I will recommend this item."
4.0,Beautiful Gloves.  Would have appreciated them arriving in a more professional packaging with at least a tag on them showing a description of what they are and a note about them being able to be used on cell phones.  Now I have to go to a website and print the data off.<br /><br />Suppose it does not matter if you are buying them for yourself but when you give them as a gift the information would have been nice.
4.0,"My fiance was very pleased with how well these fit, he could also feel the compression working right away which was nice to see. Our only complaint was it seems to make his feet sweat more than other brands."
4.0,"This was a great gift for my wife - after she wore it for a few months the colors faded so the were all silver, but that was fine by her! She loved to play with it, spinning the rings around to have something to do with her hands"
4.0,"I like it, I wish there would have been a bigger size. But it's good."
4.0,Super cute & comfortable. Drapes nicely & now a regular item in my wardrobe
4.0,"Great quality of a product, but the bottoms are slightly too small and have a narrow cut in the back. Also the top is a tad snug. I would recommend buying a size larger than you usually buy. I am impressed, especially for the price point, at the quality of the material. It seems like to should hold up well over time, though I haven't worn / swam / or washed it just yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tankini bathing suits, but I would recommend buying one size larger than you typically do. I received this product at a discounted price."
4.0,Love it. Bought one for my son-in-law who was working in the cold and he said it worked so well he was sweating in the 0 degree weather...so I bought one for myself too.
4.0,These pants are great but really long! I had to hem them up. I am 5' 2.
4.0,Love the material and style. This is a fun shirt to wear.
4.0,"Fits great, looks super cute. The only reason it's not a five star is that the top of the bra area curls up a little."
4.0,"Shirt is well made and a beautiful color, but the sizing isn‚Äôt quite accurate, so I can‚Äôt wear it."
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter who doesn't like bags/purses but she really liked this one so I ordered it and she really likes especially because she's a reader so she reads a lot odd books and she also writes so it needs to hold what she needs. I just hope it stands up to the toughness of teenager. It's really great that is easy to clean as well.
4.0,I ordered the XL based on the size chart chest measurements. I‚Äôm a size 10 with 34/36 H chest. The wrap front fits well but I will either need to tack it together to hold it shut or wear a tank underneath. The pineapple print is super cute! Not see-thru at all.
4.0,"I really liked this to go with my costume and it was cute, I could wear it out not just on my costume. But it broke the first night, I should be able to fix it."
4.0,It is very comfy and looks good in spite of being bigger than I expected
4.0,"Nice fit, a little big!!"
4.0,"I would say this fits as expected. However, I should have ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 125lbs 32dd. I wore this for my wedding rehearsal and got lots of compliments. It is comfortable and very good quality."
4.0,Very cute with jeans or slacks. I'm glad I purchased.
4.0,Great condition when I recieved it. Looked just like the picture. Very light weight.
4.0,These are soft and cute. I have a small head and really short hair so the bands are a little loose. The bandanas are a great size for wearing on neck or head. Also cute on purse or backpack.
4.0,Cute but runs big. Size down.
4.0,My daughter loves this nightgown. It's so soft and cozy that I wish it fit ME!
4.0,After reading reviews I bought a size 8 when my normal is 7.5. They were still too small. I suggest buying a full size bigger than your norm. They had nice padding inside that I don't normally see in flats so I assume they would be comfortable.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:2e1d7fe1573c0b2be0ca3e9b67b36535]] It‚Äôs beautiful I love it the only thing is the resin didn‚Äôt really set well so it feels a little rough I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll come down later and has one little chip but I don‚Äôt want to return it because it‚Äôs going to take too long to get it and it‚Äôs lightweight I love wearing it is awesome but like they could‚Äôve did a better job on the set of the resin I think that‚Äôs how it spelled
4.0,"This dress is simple, yet a show stopper! I will say it was a bit long in 5‚Äô4 and didn‚Äôt bring heels to wear with it on vacation. It is super comfortable and effortlessly sexy."
4.0,Pretty. I like it.
4.0,I like the fit and feel of the fabric.  I would buy these again.
4.0,"The shirt was a little thin, but I love how soft it is and the retro look."
4.0,I love them but one pair doesnt match
4.0,Giving it a four not because it was a bad product but because I thought it would be longer .... I'm six feet tall and the spilt in the back was a little too high for my blood
4.0,Fits more like a shirt vs a t-shirt dress.
4.0,"I love the product and price. However, I hate this company doesn't provide options to save on shipping/handling when purchasing multiple items. So, I make sure I don't purchase multiple items from them. One at a time, per their pricing."
4.0,"This product was shorter in length than I expected it to be, but it is beautiful. I would recommend this company and product."
4.0,It was a gift but a
4.0,Purchased a medium to wear to a wedding in a few weeks. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0‚Äù and 165 pounds at 33 weeks pregnant and it fits pretty well! It hits just below my ankles which is great considering the baby bump. It appears to be quite nursing friendly so I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôll be able to wear it post partum.
4.0,"5'6"" 160 lbs I read it runs small, and not liking tops that ride up, I ordered 2XL . Still snug, but not uncomfortable and it is not a very long top. But the quality of the shirts are excellent."
4.0,"i really like it, but it is a bit see thru (not too much, like you can wear nude undue...and it is super hard to iron"
4.0,"HI GUYS !! THIS PRODUCTS.. DOES NOT WORK THE LED......AT ALL....!!!<br />IS POSSIBLE I CAN CHANGE,,,, SINCE WE GIVE  A GIFT TO MY GIRL ...NEVER SHE CAN'T USE !!!<br />PLEASE.. CAN I CHANGE!!!!??????????? THANK YOU SO MUCH!! PH# 818-644-97****"
4.0,Last Russell (same description) in XL size is huge on me.  This one is size  LARGE. It is a bit tight in the waist.  We'll hope it doesn't get tighter after the first washing.
4.0,"I love the purse and the size, but the other reviews are correct it should not be a cross body.  I am short so I was hoping it would still work as a cross body but it really doesn't.  If the strap were just a little longer it would be perfect!"
4.0,Thought bouffant would be larger
4.0,"I love this wristlet! I'm in college and needed something small to hold my phone and keys on the weekends. The quality is good and the embroidery is beautiful; there were a few spots where a string or two have frayed over the last few weeks but not enough to deteriorate the image. It holds my iPhone 6, my keys, and money/cards with a little room to spare. I have had no problems with the strap or zipper, and have owned it for several weeks now. Great buy!"
4.0,Cap is comfortable for a day at work.
4.0,"Very nice, quality, fit and look. Very happy with it. Was a gift and he really likes it. Arrived on time."
4.0,My daughter lives in these shoes. She loves the fact that it is very light and she can run faster.  Will purchase again.
4.0,1 STONE WAS DISLODGED GLUED IT BACK IN otherwise perfect order
4.0,I like the quality and material of the Souke running shorts. These shorts were very comfortable if you like the high rise fit. The pockets would not hold an iPhone XR or the X. There is room for a key or credit card which is nice.
4.0,I have them throughout the house.
4.0,Nice but arms are a little on the short side.
4.0,"Love these pants! My only problem is the waistband. It has this tiny little elastic piece that I wish was much thicker. I‚Äôm not sure how the waistband would fit into the ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù category but I‚Äôm usually a medium/large in most pants and these fit me well. They are thin, soft, and comfy."
4.0,"Fit is good, price wasn't bad, prompt shipping.  Would get 5 stars if elastic in waistband was a little &#34;stronger&#34;, while the fit is very good, the elastic is somewhat weak."
4.0,Great but expensive.
4.0,"I've ordered this at least 3 times. It's a nice looking chain. As I'm sure has been state, it does change colors eventually, but for me the price isn't bad, and it does what I need it to. LOOKS GREAT ON!"
4.0,"The bracelet came as described.All charms came with it as described. the green birthstone charm is placed on the bottom wire of the adjustable part of the bracelet, so movement for that charm is restricted to the adjusted length. the heart and wing are on the bangle part, so they have a lot more movement.<br />The bracelet was great and I  loved it.  I knocked off a star though because I only wore it a few times when the heart fell off. my bracelet got caught on the corner of my desk and when I got up the bracelet pulled and the heart charm popped off.  It was accidental, but I feel that if it were better quality it wouldn't have fallen off."
4.0,"These are a little tight. She typical where's a 10 and they are loose. Not these, they are snug. One pair is also a little longer then the other. But they are cute."
4.0,"I thought they would be warm enough to cycle on cold, windy days; but when it drops below 50F, I have to wear a wool base layer and a pair of shorts."
4.0,"My son just started wearing little man underwear, and these are really nicely made. They are a little large even with the bit they slightly shrunk in the wash before use. Other than that I have no problems with these, he will grow into them!"
4.0,"Comfy, the pockets are a bit bulky but this is great for lounging around the house."
4.0,comfortable and washable. should work great
4.0,"My grandson loved the pajamas.  I thought I had read where the bottoms had a drawstring, but it was an elastic waist.  He is rather thin and I think that might be a problem."
4.0,"Well made, a little on the heavy side."
4.0,"It's a really pretty dress and well made. The fit just didn't work with my body type. The chest was really fitted and kind of made the entire thing look like a maternity outfit for me. If I went up in size, the dress would be much too large."
4.0,Very sexy but make sure you put it on correctly with all those open areas
4.0,"I normally wear size 8-10 and medium in most tops. I could have worn a medium in this however I wanted a large not to my body type of dress for church and also for the fact that I will have to make the slit shorter by the knee . It looks just as the picture, the color is perfect. I am curvy with no tummy issues ,so it is a bit loose in the middle, but not enough to annoy me."
4.0,"I like the sweater overall, it's a little odd at the neck as it stretches.  Could be becuase I'm busty and it's pulling a little.  It's stretchy though so can be adjusted to look good."
4.0,Very good quality.  The side zipper is a bit cumbersome and the wait was a tad small.

4.0,"This wallet is made of really good thick material and so it is very sturdy. My ID fits great in the front pocket window but when I put my cards into the inside pockets I could only fit one in each and it was a tight fit. There is a zipper on the top with two pockets that can hold cash or change, I put the leftover cards I couldn‚Äôt fit in the two pockets in there as well. It is small enough to carry which I like, but big enough to carry what every you would need in a wallet."
4.0,"Work well. Only drawback is the placement of the snaps...not really at either. It still works well, harder to fasten."
4.0,"Got them for my nephew....as a FIFA aficionado he loves them!<br />They are a little big, but he's a growing boy......"
4.0,nice size  purchased as a gift
4.0,The chest area is too small.
4.0,"Cute for a cheap anklet. A couple of the gold balls were slightly discolored but overall it's cute looking. We'll see how it holds up, only had it on for a day.<br /><br />Update: It came apart fairly quick. Had to use some needle nose pliers to reshape the circular part that keeps it together. Held up for another week and then the chains on both sides slipped out from where they are held within. BUMMER! :("
4.0,Much like a backpack  too much adjustment and is hard to adjust straps too.
4.0,I love them. They are great length and quality. The green is a beautiful forst green. Fast shipping!
4.0,Slightly large. Ordered a small
4.0,"I normally wear a 9 and these fit a little snug, but not too small. After a wore them a few days, they stretched and are comfortable. I think they are cute and don't have any complaints about them. They have a thick padding at the bottom with a rubber sole, so I'm able to wear them for quick trips outside. Plus the rubber helps protect against the bottom getting worn too quickly. The only thing I wish is that they came in more colors."
4.0,So pretty BUT the bitten of mine is nothing like the ‚Äúhandkerchief‚Äù style in the photo... just a straight bottem with a slit. I‚Äôll keep it cause the price was amazing and it fits well.
4.0,"It is just a little bit tight, but I assume the large would be too loose so I am going to stick with the medium. I am a 34 c."
4.0,They fit a little small at a men's US 10.5 but great material and so comfortablesaid they would arrive in December but they came way early.
4.0,I ordered according to the size chart and it fits nicely.  Seems well made a came very quickly!
4.0,"This thing is, yknow, ok. I am a belt wearer, to the max, but I also have some pretty specific criteria for a good belt. First off, this one is perfectly comfortable and does not pitch, squish or make unsightly rolls. I'm on the small size, with a max 30&#34; waist. I purchased the white/cream color because I have only one other belt in that color, but I wish I had purchased a darker color. The band is wide and would have been more flattering in black, brown, or navy. The buckle looks like about what it is: cheap materials but still solid and decently made. It's not my go to, but we will see when summer comes around again. ;)"
4.0,Band is solid elegant and fairly sturdy. If you‚Äôre looking for a simple clean looks then you‚Äôre spot on. My one and only issues is the deployment clasp. If you‚Äôre a skinnier guy like myself then you‚Äôll likely fasten the claps down a bit more than average. When that happens the button to release the clasp may engage and open up the band while on your wrist at least partially. So while it looks and feels awesome please do keep that in mind when picking this up.
4.0,"Overall, this is a good faux septum ring. It's unique with the interchangeable stones, and it's a good size. However, I wish that it was able to be tightened around the openening (believe me I've tried) because I personally have a very thin nose. It stays in my nose but it moves around a little too much for my liking. I will most likely still wear this but probably not as often as I'd like. On a plus side for others, it's not cheap at all seeing as how the strongest pliers I have were not able to bend it. Perfect for people with slightly larger noses than me, or those who don't mind a little movement from the ring."
4.0,My daughter loves stitch. This was a Good Christmas present
4.0,"I bought this as a fun replacement for my real engagement ring while I'm losing weight and don't want to have to resize multiple times. I made the mistake of not immediately painting the inside of the ring with clear nail polish, like normal. I do have really sensitive skin. It's a little bit flashy compared to my real engagement ring, but it's really fun. I can't speak to the sizing because I don't know my real size, so I took a guess, compared to my old size.<br />I probably won't wear it every day when I go out, since I ordered a nice eternity band for daily wear, but all girls like to have fun with flashy jewelry! And, I'm not an expert or anything, but it looks real to me. (As long as you don't turn it over and look at the scratches. It does scratch very easily, so I'm hoping my new coat of nail polish, which I will apply regularly will stop that).<br />Overall, you may want nail polish on it to prevent scratching and green skin, if you have sensitive skin."
4.0,"I find these sturdy and light weight. My glasses and sunglasses fit snuggly in them, so I‚Äôm comfortable that neither will fall out."
4.0,"really cute, exactly like the picture. runs on the small side, very cheeky."
4.0,I mainly use these for outdoor cooking and routine maintenance on my vehicles. So far they are holding up nicely and I don't have any complaints yet. I would buy again.
4.0,I like this fabric design and it washes well.
4.0,Really like the print and lite weight of fabric. Would buy again but in one size smaller.
4.0,The glasses are pretty good. Just wish the side panels would fit closer to the cheek for my daughter. She has severe  pollen allergies and they help reduce eye irritation
4.0,"so far, so good, a bit tight on the bridge of the nose, but workable. I like the amber lens, and the fact that I can read my instrument panel, which I couldn't do with sunglass readers. So, I am happy!"
4.0,Nice sunglasses all and all
4.0,These bracelets are made much better than I expected. The beading is also much tinier than I expected. Overall would recommend and will probably buy more.
4.0,"I liked it very much, as did my boyfriend. It fit nicely and the color is great"
4.0,This ring is supposed to be adjustable but I needed pliers to make it a little smaller- but that is my only complaint. I've gotten many compliments on it. The stones are beautiful and the same colors as shown in the photo. It also goes with everything.
4.0,"This is a nice jacket. It's on the thinner side and lightweight, but still warm. I normally go for a large in shirts these days to get the fit I prefer. I took a chance on a medium in this jacket, and while it mostly fits fine, it's a little snug at my hip area. It's still wearable, though a large probably would have been perfect. (So, I'd say it's pretty true to size.) Since it does fit me on the mostly snugger side, for super cold days it could even be worn under a larger fitting jacket to give more warmth. (It doesn't get super cold too often where I live, so I don't have a thick jacket. An extra layer helps on those cold days and I don't have to lose closet space to a thick jacket.)<br /><br />The 5Oaks logo is on the chest and I dislike this greatly. It makes me feel like I'm advertising a lumber company that nobody has ever heard of. As long as you don't mind the logo, it's a great addition to a wardrobe."
4.0,Was better made then I thought it would be for the price
4.0,This skirt is simple Beautiful
4.0,Very well liked.  Pretty stones and shines bright under certain lighting.
4.0,"Super comfy, but if you are tall like me (5'9&#34;) it does run a little short."
4.0,Ordered a small for my daughter's Harley Quinn costume. It's really cute on her. I'm going to add a red and black strap so she can wear a regular bra with it. It's a small but it's really for a woman with bigger boobs so I'll have to alter the top a little. It also comes with a pair of THONGS!!...that don't cover much :) but we are very satisfied with our purchase.
4.0,I just had to order it 2 sizes bigger and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"Cute, but too small."
4.0,If you make jewelry this is what the doctor ordered
4.0,"I love love love this swimsuit!! It's comfortable and colors are accurate to the photos. I usually wear a 2x but after reading reviews, I ordered a 3x. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is much bigger than expected. Great product for the price. I'm ordering more in another style."
4.0,Nice silky scarves in bright colors.
4.0,"Purchased this for my granddaughter (4yr old) as she is into The Wizard of Oz now and wanted a &#34;Dorothy dress&#34;. The others I saw were way to short and not what I would like to see her in. I ordered this in the smallest size they have and while it is a bit big for her she loves it. She is a tiny 4yr old but it does run big, so just watch the sizing. I found a spool of ribbon that matched the dress pattern and simply made her the &#34;Dorothy bows&#34; that she wears in her braids. Just bout the snap barrettes and tied the ribbon thru them and made a bow. Very simple. I would recommend this dress over the others they advertise this is modest, were I feel the others were not. Gave 4 stares just for the fact that it does run quiet large. But, she loves it and wears in routinely so still worth the money."
4.0,"The materials are kind of cheapy, but the color is great, the belt fits nicely, and it seems pretty durable"
4.0,"My wife really likes the pendant with the ruby and diamonds.  Unfortunately, the chain broke before the end of the first day.  She has other chains so she can put the pendant on one of those.  I think they should sell it without the chain because it is flimsy and really has little or no value.<br />They did send a new chain and it is much better.  Thank you!"
4.0,"Couple of the charms were broken upon receiving it, but there were few extra charms in the bag but they were duplicates. Additionally, several of the charms can only be used on a necklace because some of them are large size"
4.0,"They are a little big on me and I do not like to wear a belt while biking. However, the convenience of the removable underwear is fantastic. Can clip in or wear with different shorts. Great value and work great on the trails!"
4.0,I thought it would have more give to the fabric. Order was normal size. Otherwise I like it. I recommend ordering up normal size
4.0,"I really liked these, have had them for about 6 months now. Only thing I wish they had was a tag that denoted front and back. Taking them off and flipping them is kind of annoying."
4.0,"The glasses themselves are flat out BADASS!! Love the design!! They even come with a nice case and spare black uv lens. The only reason im giving them a 4 is because the nose piece is plastic and cracks easily, and there is also a rubber piece that connects to the nose piece and it doesnt stay on the glasses very well.  In fact it falls off all the time, and can be easy to lose so I had to super glue it. I‚Äôve had this issue on both of my pairs. The nose piece can‚Äôt be replaced if lost, the company makes you buy a new pair."
4.0,The band itself was some what tight but other then that it super cute
4.0,I bought this product expecting to have only half of them work. I was surprized when all but one worked even though 3 of the white colored ones were dim. Very nice buy for the price. I would defiantly buy this product again. They don't last for more than 24 hours on but if you are smart enough to turn them off when your not using them they can last a while. 2 months later I still have a few that have charge to them.
4.0,"Good quality, good value. Four stars because of the sizing that leaves quite a bit of velcro tail to wrap back."
4.0,A little bit bigger than I expected that's why I gave them 4 starts but still beautiful and super shiny.
4.0,"It took quit a while to get here and there seems to be a weird scratch on the front! but it isn't that noticeable, also the color of it is beautiful! the inside is very spacious and can hold A LOT of stuff!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a nice swimsuit just a bit small but great material
4.0,"These are very light and delicate, very pretty. The clasp broke on mine after 2 months is the only problem I had."
4.0,Bought for my brother who has an issue with his pants since he was a kid. Hope this adjustable belts will solve the issue. Very annoying to see him holding up his pants with his hands.
4.0,"Socks are very comfortable, not much compression."
4.0,Nice and comfy sweater. I liked the slits it has on the sides
4.0,the girls liked them
4.0,Nicely styled little boot- great with boot cut or snug fit jeans.
4.0,It does give to fit better if you where a large go for the Xl  for the better fit
4.0,Well my wife loves it so that makes it a winner in my book.
4.0,"This mask is primarily to keep dust out of your nostrils, and does little to impede any contagions YOU may be carrying, so don't expect to function like that.  If you are considering it as a Covid mask, take apart the vents and pack them with tissue, or something better, or seal them up completely, so the mask filter works both ways.<br /><br />It is comfortable, and stays where you put it OVER your nose without too much fuss or re-adjustments.<br /><br />Note: The Flyers were on a roll in the playoffs until I purchased this mask, so if you're superstitious, keep that in mind."
4.0,"Good fit, but would have preferred the normal wider waistband that's not covered in fabric.  Otherwise, they are fine."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, I receive lots of compliments when wearing it. The sweetheart neckline is a little off center but not enough to keep me from wearing the dress."
4.0,"The sleeves are a little short, but overall they fit well. I got them because I have Parkinson's and they let me slide and move more easily over fleece sheets."
4.0,Perfect for larger chested women who need extra support.
4.0,"Purchased multiple tunics as a gift... light material and looks great. Necklaces are a bonus and look great. The only downside was there were a few spots, not on all shirts, it had some tears or stitching wasn't done well enough"
4.0,This is a cute ring and one you can wear daily.  It appears a little more purple than green to me. I love it though.
4.0,"This is a review for the Deargles Womens Button down Chiffon Blouse Shirt in medium.  I purchased this shirt for my daughter who wears a US ladies size 6.  It fit her well and would also fit a US size 8 as there was some room in it for her.  It looked good on her.  The seems and sewing of it looked good.  Only the parts meant to be see through were see through.  It could be worn dressed up or dressed down.  I received this shirt as a promotional test product at a discounted price to use and review.  I do not guarantee a five star review, the stars are based off my personal feelings after receiving and using the product. This is my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This is such a cute dress. The color is a pale pink/beige with beautiful lace trim. When I see this dress, &#34;feminine&#34; is the first thing to come to mind. I got this in a size small, It is a loose fit, which I love. I wore this dress on a casual date and it was so cute! The dress can be a little see through but I wore the proper attire underneath so it was no problem. The straps are also adjustable which is nice!<br /><br />I received this dress in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I love the black and white colors. I've gotten several compliments when I've worn the necklace.
4.0,"This bra works but the pads are way funky. They‚Äôre supposed to be there so you don‚Äôt leak and have some coverage and comfort, but they show through the bra and therefore show through the shirt.. i can‚Äôt wear it alone when I go out the way that it comes,  because the pads are lumpy so I either need to put my own nursing pads in or wear it at home. It does it‚Äôs purpose, the snaps work well to pull down and feed baby and the bra is good for lounging at Home or sleeping. If you take the pads out it may look better. I took off a star because the quality isn‚Äôt amazing, but for the price it‚Äôs not bad."
4.0,Great socks.  I wear them around the house all the time.
4.0,"I love the fit and color of this long sleeved shirt!  True to size! It‚Äôs was perfect for my hike as well!  It was a little see-through, which didn‚Äôt look like that by looking at the picture."
4.0,Nicely made.  Good fit. Highly recommend!
4.0,Holds the pressure very well and very comfortable. A little bit hard to Loop.
4.0,"Looks exactly like the photo, runs small though and the shorts are see through. Would still buy again üëçüèº"
4.0,I have received many compliments while wearing this. It was however missing a pocket button but I don't button them anyways so it's fine. It's nice and thick. I got a small and I'm glad I did. Normally I'm a small and it was still large..which I wanted.
4.0,"Just a bit too large, but wearable. I like it"
4.0,"Very cute, durable, easy to walk around and great grip. My daughter just started walking and these pair work perfect for her not to slide"
4.0,Fits great and I get lots of compliments!  Very flattering since it nips in at the natural waist to accent the slimmest part of the silhouette. The only reason it doesn‚Äôt get 5 starts is that now that I‚Äôve worn it 3-4 times the fabric is starting to pill on the front and under the arms a bit. It‚Äôs not unwearable yet but it‚Äôs definitely not something I would wear for anything more than a casual day. When it first arrived and the first 2 times I wore it I could have worn it to a cocktail party or even a wedding (that wasn‚Äôt like black tie or something). For the price it‚Äôs great I just wish it held up a bit better.
4.0,"So I REALLY wanted to love these, and I do like them and wear them often...however, one of the earrings has a faulty magnet that appears to have been glued in too far into the earring and the magnet isn't very strong so the earring doesn't stay clasped like it should. Other than that I DO like them. To be clear, these are WEIGHTS so do understand what you're buying. They are supposed to be heavy to keep your holes from closing up when not wearing your plugs. Don't expect to buy weighted earrings that aren't heavy, as that would defeat the point. Would I buy them again? Yes, for the price, absolutely, although I am waiting for a sale to cop my next pair. :P"
4.0,"The lens scratch easily, other than that I love them"
4.0,"Fit well, comfortable.  Not much else to say."
4.0,"Very beautiful and catches light very well however, the rod is to short. I got this as a gift for a friend and she thought it was beautiful until she put it on. Rather than dangling from her belly button, it sinks to the back of it (she is rather slim). I do recommend this item but be mindful that it may be to short. I included side by side comparisons this this item and her own personal piercing."
4.0,"These are actually going to be a back-up pair for me. I ordered the ""black"" and they look pretty nice. I checked them to make sure they were really polarized - they seem to be. The fit wasn't great for me, however. The nose piece was way too tight and it made the glasses sit too far from my face. Delicately spreading them apart seemed to help the problem a little. They still leave a lot of light coming in from the sides, but I don't want to knock down the score for what may just be my personal preference in style. This lens color is also a first for me, but I actually found myself really liking them. Might not be the best choice for bright sunlight though - I can't usually see inside with my Oakleys and with these I can easily."
4.0,Very beautiful... Like a lot.. The earrings the right length... Love the three tone color...
4.0,"Works as advertised, provided relief compared to normal long socks.  Just wish they were a size or two larger."
4.0,"A little tight in the arms, but is a good fit overall!"
4.0,"If you only need a slight boost in your reading glasses, especially if you like to read outside, these would be perfect for you. They are 1.0X magnifying bifocal reading/sunglasses. The gradually go from darker to lighter (top to bottom). The glasses appear to be well made and they came with a good case, cleaning cloth, and a nice little screwdriver which can always be useful. These are very nice glasses for those that need the slight boost."
4.0,"The girls loved these Peppa pig bracelets! They are so cute and love that the elastic allows for various size kids. The actual elastic used for bracelets are poor and fray if you stretch too much, which is easy for my limit testing toddler."
4.0,There was no clothe bag to put it in. Only wrap in wrapping paper
4.0,Love the jersey. Color and fabric are great and very thick. Bought for my son to wear to his hockey practices but it ran a little small with his gear on. We‚Äôll size up next time.
4.0,This is a very pretty dress.  I ordered an XLG because I had a feeling it might run small.  I'm a size 14 which is not normally an XLG.  The material is very nice.  This dress will emphasize your bust line.... wear with caution.
4.0,They look very cheap.
4.0,Says what you want it too!
4.0,Very nice cover-up.  Wouldn't wear as just a dress.  Fits a little small so size up.
4.0,Cute and dainty! I would buy again!
4.0,"Very cute they are a gift for my niece, I think she will love them!!"
4.0,This was a present for my daughter's friend's baby girl. The colors are so bright and it is a very cute outfit.
4.0,Fit nicely.<br />I bought these for my father in law.<br />We have wood floors and he uses a walker.<br />I was hopeful that they would not slip on the floor but there isn't enough grip to be non slip.
4.0,"The filters fit this respirator very comfortably.  They are not n95 or kn95 rated but it protects you better than a cloth mask or whatever.  The replacement filters take a minute to come in but there are plenty to ensure you have enough to last you. This respirator is easy to clean, functional, easy to use and comfotable. I enjoy mine"
4.0,Would have gotten 5 stars but the zipper is a little cheap but other than that gloves are great they are my little heart zip up at first but now since the glasses are broken they zip up just fine nice pair of gloves would buy again
4.0,A beautiful purse but the color is too much of a red color more than wine colored.
4.0,"The listing said the fit is smaller than usual so order a size larger, so I did. I should have ordered a size smaller because they fit *larger* than expected. They feel good, though, and despite the larger fit, they don't bunch up under my clothes or become uncomfortable."
4.0,This Danedvi Hooded cardigan is:<br /><br />-chunky.<br />-designed to be oversized.<br />-has a fun ribbed pattern all over.<br />-has pockets.<br />-is warm and cozy.<br />-has an open closure.<br />-a little small. I ordered up and am glad that I did.<br />-perfect to wear with a dress or jeans.
4.0,"Wish the sizes were a bit larger for the price, but it is timberland. Overall, product works great! Got the scuffs off my black boots & waterproofed my tan ones!"
4.0,"I got these to help relieve some of the aches and pains I experience from standing all day while working at the hospital. I was immediately impressed with the quality and effectiveness. Getting these socks isn‚Äôt a magic solution that makes the aches and pains disappear, but they certainly help. I‚Äôm a small woman, and it‚Äôs been tricky to find good compression socks that fit me well. These have been the best so far around my feet, ankles, and calves, but they are slightly too long. Since they fit well otherwise, I‚Äôve chosen to keep them and fold the extra length at the top over so that they sit just below my knees. I wish there was an option to buy these in a shorter length, but overall they are still the best fitting and most effective compression socks I‚Äôve tried."
4.0,"No me gust√≥ el tono de azul, no es el mismo que muestra en la foto, las dem√°s est√°n aceptables"
4.0,"I'm a huge fan of shape wear and I must say I have never experienced anything quite like  before. The moonlight elves Women Body Shaper High Waist Butt Lifter Tummy Control Shape-wear Panties has boning at the waist and I can really feel the compression on my torso. It is literally creating a rounder shape on my flattish rear end. Pretty amazing.  For reference I am 5'3""/115 lbs/36DD... and yes, I need shape wear at my age. After losing 45 lbs my spare skin creates almost as many issues as my fat did. Muffin top fat or flab is still muffin top! Having been both heavy, thin and every where in between, I can tell you this will work miracles if you are heavier. At my current weight it reigns in my loose flabby skin and gives me more of an hour glass shape. I am slender with a boxy shape and middle age speed so that alone is a miracle. . I was sent a size large, which is to long for my body. I was able to cinch it down and can still feel how much compression this offers. It's not that easy to breath while seated, but not as restrictive as the old fashioned girdles, corsets and long line bras of the sixties.  I plan to buy one in a smaller size because I am properly impressed. Especially for the enhancements to my bottom. It literally gave it a shape and created something from  of nothing! I am truly amazed!"
4.0,"This beanie is almost exactly what I was looking for. It is a bit heavier than I was expecting, but other than that the fit and color were spot on. This is a really slouchy beanie as well. The product picture is a very accurate description of it."
4.0,When I opened the package I thought to myself  this isn't gonna fit to my suprise they perfect n in my size my new fav jeans love them
4.0,"This is a great basic shirt for work.  It's thick enough to not be see through, and looks good and blends in in an office environment.  If you need a basic work shirt, this is a good option.<br /><br />Fabric:  The Amazon product page says this is ""polyester, spandex, cotton"".  I can't read the label on the shirt, because I wore and washed this before writing the review and all the writing on the label washed off in just one washing!  The shirt feels like polyester.  It's a woven material with no stretch.  I'm pretty sure that this is 100% polyester with no spandex and no cotton in it.  This is just one layer of fabric (not lined), but is thick enough to not be see through.  My bra doesn't show through it at all, and as long as you are doing dark bras with dark shirts, light bras with light shirts, and solid colored bra, then this shirt is fine.  I got the ""Blue"" color, which is fairly dark, and that one is not see through anyway.  The fabric is thin and unlined, so if worn tight potentially could show a bra line, but since the fit of the shirt is loose and flowy, as long as you get size right, it's not a cut that will show lines.  This fabric is to where it could potentially snag, if you have cats who get on you and knead with their claws out, which I do, so for me it's a work shirt and not for around the house.<br /><br />Size:  The size chart gives size in inches.  Since I'm busty, I went by the bust measurement, then sized up one.  I got 2XL.  The fit is as expected, and the size chart seems accurate.<br /><br />Construction:  This is one layer of fabric (it's unlined).  The neckline, sleeves, and hem are all finished by folding the fabric over twice and chain stitching the hem in place so that there are no exposed fabric edges.  Side seams and where the sleeves attach are stitched together and the raw edges are serged together to prevent unraveling.  The shirt seems like it will last through a good amount of wear.<br /><br />The look:  The shirt looks good in person.  It's perfectly appropriate for an office environment and is something I can throw on without thinking about it and it will tend to match most suits or pants.  Shirt is long enough to hang over my pants and not ride up or be an issue when I bend over or sit down.  The neckline has the pleats on it to give some interest, and is also high enough that I can bend over and not flash anyone.<br /><br />Care and washing:  I washed this in the washing machine.  Then I hand dry most of my shirts on hangers.  I thought that this shirt would be wrinkle resistant, but it actually did wrinkle a bit.  This is mostly noticeable along the bottom hem of the shirt (waistline / bottom of the shirt).  It's not very noticeable on the neckline and sleeves because the pleats there tend to give the look of the shirt.  It's not too bat, but I tend to go for natural fibers, and if I get a polyester, I at least want wrinkle resistant easy care to be on lock down and for that to be my draw for getting a synthetic fiber.<br /><br />Not so good for travel:  This fabric is a bit prone to wrinkling and so would have to be folded neatly and kept neatly to look good during travel.  It also folds up very small, so doesn't take much space in luggage.  And the material is thin enough that it would dry overnight on a hanger, so with this shirt, you have the option to wash it in the hotel sink, and then hang dry it overnight.  But, the tendency to wrinkle a bit means I think it's a poor option for business travel, since it has to be folded just so and kept from jostling around much and there's a chance you get there and it's got wrinkles in it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good basic office shirt.  It looks good in person.  The material is thick enough that I don't need to worry about my bra showing through, and I can just throw it on and be dressed and done.  And the fit is flowy and looks good while still having low maintenance office things like a high neckline, good length to hand over my pants waist and not ride up, and loose flowy fit to not show a bra line.  And the quality is totally adequate.  The way seams are finished seems appropriate and the shirt should last through a good amount of wear.  The only downside is that this fabric tends to wrinkle a bit and needs a bit more attention when hanging or folding to store after washing.  It's not bad enough to need ironing, and probably a portable steamer would handle it, but the bit of wrinkle is still there.  Shirt does look good though, and I fully anticipate wearing this in rotation in my new job.  It's just going to annoy me to have to be prissy with how I store it every time after washing."
4.0,"This is an attractive bag in a good size, not too small and not too big. However, it is NOT leather, as the description says. A tag on it says, polyurethane foam. Nonetheless, it is a cute bag. The strap is very long so I may need to shorten it."
4.0,"This was nice, small and dainty yet long enough to reach to about right below my rib cage. I'm 5'10.  The pearl on the end is very small, so don't purchase this if you are looking for a large statement necklace. Overall though, this fits what I was looking for!"
4.0,A perfect purchase for my daughter's gown.  She is attending the Cadet Ball and the earrings were gorgeous and went well with the dress.  I appreciate the prompt service.
4.0,Its hard to take the credit cards out but it might just need to break in a bit
4.0,Fit good better to wear when it's cold but cool
4.0,"They get the job done. I saw much cuter hats, but these work for me because I have ever-changing hairstyles that don‚Äôt always fit under regular hats. They were easy to travel with."
4.0,Worked well in SE Asia where it was hot and humid.  Length was good for visiting temples where knees had to be covered.  Wore then a lot on the trip and they worked great.
4.0,"I bought these because I spend so much time in front of a computer. I use a computer for work and I also work at home. I know the effect that this continued blue light exposure can have on my eyes. So despite not needing glasses, I do want to continue to protect my eyes. It comes with  blue light tester so you can see that this item really does work to filter out blue light. On top of being functional the glasses are cute too. They are light weight and come in a nice protective carrying case. Overall a good buy."
4.0,Should have bought large. Might exchange but I did like it very much. Hopefully will be a hit at Universal Studios.
4.0,"Ordered size L, as I am in most shirts and these are super tight.  Got the XL and fits great. Recommend going up a size. Quality seems really nice."
4.0,"Only complaint is that it's not quite tight enough. My little key rings still inadvertently travel into the slot and get caught there. But I haven't lost anything yet, so I suppose that's good enough."
4.0,Fit a little smaller than I had thought it would. Still love it.
4.0,Not really very bright but ok
4.0,"This is my first Zulu style strap I have ever purchased, so take my rating with a grain of salt.  I really like the look of the strap and it's sufficiently short for my girly-man wrist.  I have a seiko watch that has far spring bars and just an FYI, those won't fit into this strap. The included bars also didn't fit my watch as they were too thin. I had to order some spring bars on 'the bay' to fit this band with my watch.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the stiffness of the band.  It's definitely not a soft band. That doesn't make it uncomfortable though."
4.0,"thanks, the second one fit much better"
4.0,"I would have given it a higher rating, however it shows wear, color is fading on edges"
4.0,Chain broke immediately after taking it from package but it was an easy enough fix. Otherwise my son and I both were pleased with the item and its a great price as well.
4.0,"I bought this for my husband as a present. I did handwashing & air drying it to make less wrinkle. It's a nice shirt with reasonable price. I'm happy with my order but just one thing which I think I shouldn't public it...anyway, they fixed it for me."
4.0,"Beautiful, wish they were slightly bigger to show up in photos but loved the design/colors"
4.0,so beautiful. love the backing on these earrings-wonderful/comfortable and secure.  yea
4.0,Beautiful but sizes are off for each piece.
4.0,"Works well.  Takes a little exertion, but makes the silver clean without messy chemicals."
4.0,This dress is so beautiful and very comfortable. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 175lbs and ordered a large and it fits great. My only complaint is that you have to wear a slip or something under it because the buttons are not fashioned in a way that holds the each side closely together so you can see your skin up the whole front side.
4.0,"Runs small, but overall ok."
4.0,Too small. Returning.
4.0,"These fun, fur covered toy handcuffs are pretty cheaply made so they are easy to get out of and aren't very durable, but overall good for ""toys"". They come with the little key set, but you can also push the little button on the cuffs to ""escape""."
4.0,I bought it for a gift. It looks nice.
4.0,"Thin material, but really cute. It came too small for me, but I guess it my fault!"
4.0,Material thinner than I expected. It suggested a extra large but a large would have been better I am swimming in the xl
4.0,"This watch came in a square, sturdy cardboard box.<br /><br />What I Like about this Sports Watch<br />1. I really appreciate the long watchband - makes it nice for folks who are larger-framed.<br />2. I love the silicone band. I wasn't sure at first if I'd like it, as I thought it might be more sweaty. But it's really comfortable and pleasant to touch.<br />3. The watch seems to keep good time (and not lose minutes!)<br /><br />What Could Be Improved<br />1. This watch is a little large for a woman - I think it would likely be more appreciated by a man. I'd love a smaller version!<br /><br />I purchased this sports watch at a promotional price for testing and review purposes. Overall, this seems to be a quality watch.  The band is immensely comfortable to touch, though less comfortable at the spot where the metal point is. (It's rather thick at that point. It wasn't a problem until I started typing. If you don't do a lot of computer work, this watch would be great.) Again, the circular part of the watch is big - more fitting for a man's wrist. I'd specifically recommend this watch for a physically active gentleman. That being said, I‚Äôm still wearing it to school. I‚Äôm rarely at a computer there, so the thickness of the &#34;latch&#34; is not a problem."
4.0,"Good quality, low cost sunglasses so you don't have to worry about losing them.  Good fit, even for larger heads.  One downfall is lens color variation is not as noticeable as the picture leads you to believe."
4.0,Love the product and the seller. Would buy this product again. Highly recommend it
4.0,Love these watches but the plastic straps break after a year or so... and a replacement strap is ~$13 when a new watch is ~$10.  Really frustrating to have to throw away a perfectly good watch because a 2c piece of plastic broke and there is't a cost effective way to buy a replacement part.
4.0,So far so good. Working very well.
4.0,Made of good material. Fits great..
4.0,"My daughter-in-law liked this robe very much, although the hood seemed a little big for a size small (that's the reason for only four stars).  The material was very soft and warm.  Would recommend it."
4.0,the shiping was slow but i think it looks alright and the price is low
4.0,These earrings are small but cute..good for the price
4.0,"Arrived timely, and are adorable! Kind of heavy, might want to add larger disc backs to wear them more comfortably."
4.0,"love the feel, comfortable but the waistband is a bit snug with little elasticity.<br />overall very good"
4.0,Really neat looking shoes....I was just disappointed that they were too narrow for me
4.0,For the price it's hard to go wrong. The zipper gets suck after a couple of uses but thats to be expected of anything this cheap. It's really cute for a night out on the town though.
4.0,"Surprisingly durable frames with the spring loaded bows.  And at this price, I can leave one in all the various places I might need them."
4.0,"Great product for great price. These were perfect for my first cruise to Bahamas. They were lightweight and the option to change up between the two was great. The only thing to have in mind, while I looked at my phone to take pictures on the trip, it looked as if I was looking through 3D glasses. Not sure how to explain that well but changes the look on some items as far as color depending on how bright it is. Specially the green and blue glasses."
4.0,like them alot so many to choose from. and the item camereally fast in the mail. they could have sparated it
4.0,This was great for my daughters birthday party as it was unicorn.  But the eye lashes were the wrong way to match set I got her and I had to have it fixed as the neck size was so large  it fell off her to the floor! But after it was fixed..its very pretty
4.0,Love this band! Feels alot better than the bands the watches come with
4.0,"I love this bag! The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it all 5 stars is that the straps don‚Äôt stay tight and I have to adjust them all the time. And also now that it‚Äôs been a couple months, the cute metal things on the front catch on stuff sometimes. This obviously means I‚Äôve put it to good use. But other than that, it‚Äôs my sidekick and holds ALL my important stuff. It‚Äôs super cute and I love it!"
4.0,"But have to send it back because I don't like how the top part  looks, I feel like my breasts are going to fall out.<br />Besides that I like the fit & length of the skirt attached."
4.0,hermosas piedras y muy fino
4.0,"Great shorts that is perfect for working out. Only issue I noticed is that it runs quite small and is quite tight, so I would get one size larger if you want a looser fit."
4.0,A nice dressy belt that was true to size. A fair price and high quality.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Love the look and feel of it, plus it fits very well. Very nicely constructed and with good material as well. Arrived on time and was in good condition upon arrival."
4.0,I bought a number of these for the killer heat in south Florida. They are comfortable and nice but longer than I prefer.
4.0,"Very stylis, good quality. It came with case which is very handy."
4.0,"Good quality but recommend to size up especially if you want it to be a little baggy . I ordered 12-18 months for my 8month old , my child is a tall baby the height is ok but snug fitting."
4.0,"I got the hoodie it for my granddaughter at Christmas time and she loved it!  Had to buy a second hoodie because it came apart after washing and drying.  It is a must that the Hoodie be washed by hand or inside out on delicate cycle.  Do not use dryer, must hang dry.  Fits true to size."
4.0,Like this shirt very much.
4.0,"The two chain design is very pretty.  The pearl is very large and has nice luster.  The clasp is adjustable, which is actually a feature that I do not care for but it can be nice for most people.  The only issues I have with this necklace are the pearl has a large scratch on one side, the chain was badly kinked when I took it out of the box, and the clasp looks cheaper than the rest of the necklace.  The kinks worked out once I hung the necklace and it looks very pretty on.  I paired it with some basic pearl stud earrings and a navy romper outfit and I got several compliments.  I would recommend it for the price and the size of the pearl."
4.0,Lovely dress. I'm only 5 ft 1 so every long dress I get had to be tailored. It's very pretty though.  I had claps added to it due to the dress being so silky and only has a string to toe closed.
4.0,Cute shirt and fine for what u pay for it . I am 5.6 124 lbs and got a xs and it was still a tad baggy but also short lol. But it‚Äôs still cute and super comfy and breathable for a hot day at the gym .
4.0,"I loved the quality and cut, but it runs small so I had to return it."
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother. She loves purple and silver. She wears it all the time. She loves it. It's durable as she even sleeps with it on. It's a beautiful piece.
4.0,Fits perfectly for my 5 years old granddaughter.
4.0,"Beautiful rash guard suit.  However, as many have stated the breast cup inserts are too high up and I am a petite 5‚Äô2‚Äù woman.  I most likely will have to buy a sports bra or something like that, as wearing it without the inserts is NOT an option."
4.0,Loved this dress. Wore this to a conference and got so many compliments! Nice quality and really conforms to your body to show off your natural curves. The one thing that I did not like was that the dress did not have pockets. This is a big deal considering I do not like carrying purses. Never the less it is a beautiful dress and with a nice petticoat you can get a nice vintage look.
4.0,The watch is nice except for the band. I removed 4 links and it was still too big on me.  You will not be able to remove any more links. The watch band feels cheap and is very difficult to resize so I changed it to a nato strap and it works perfectly. I have washed my hands and let the water get on the watch a few times and it still functions.
4.0,Best slippers for winter EVER.  LOVE LOVE LOVE
4.0,"I loved the fabric and the color, especially the lace detail! The kind of strange shape of the neckline though in combination of the height of the peplum seam (needs to be either higher with a longer bottom section or lower with a shorter lower section) makes it a little matronly though- do not size up! I normally wear a large fitted shirt and ordered this in medium and it turned out perfect. I‚Äôll probably wear it as jammies because of the matronly - NOT to be confused with MATERNITY, Matronly is a different mood- shape to it. I have a 36/38 DD top!"
4.0,"cute shoe for my 6 year old.  i would buy them again. easy for her to put on and look nice. this picture is after a few weeks of use, and she runs around and uses them as she should"
4.0,"I was looking for a different kind of stone while on vacation and found the type I like and here it was on Amazon.  It is just as pictured, very pretty, a bit large but not heavy. I have received many compliments on them."
4.0,"This is a pretty and very comfortable ring that I'll definitely be wearing. However, I'm not as happy with it as I expected. The description says ""The ring looks much more beautiful than the pictures."" Well, I disagree. The pictures look more glittery than the actual ring I received. I think the problem is that each stone is in a pretty deep recess so only the top of the stone catches any light. In fact my main issue is that there is a little ""dip"" where each stone sits that look like little pits. This doesn't show up in the large picture of the ring; it's only visible on the picture of the ring on the model's hand, which I didn't look at as closely. Still, for the price it's a very pretty ring, it does remind me of stars!"
4.0,Nice material.. Cosy and warm but not bulky. The size was correct. Good looking sweat shirt..
4.0,wig cap was too small and the pant waist ? overall its rly good
4.0,"Very form fitting, stretchy ... looks nice. Great buy for the price. 5‚Äô3‚Äù 33DD 108lbs"
4.0,Nice ring ..got for my daughter... But they can be small
4.0,Too small! Look horrible on my  tummy!<br />and I Sent it right back‚Ä¶. Return easy
4.0,Saw this shirt while on vacation and came back to order it. I am usually a size medium. This shirt was an extra large and fit snug. Sizing seems quite a bit off.
4.0,"Simple thing, its fine"
4.0,Overall they weren't bad. I received all 10 in the mail. They arrived sooner then expected. I have used 6 already on my ears and I think they're adorable!! The only sad part is that one of the diamonds fell off but that's okay with me. I still like my purchase(: just be sure to sterilize them before putting them on. I did (:
4.0,"These cuffs had the perfect size pearls on them. My ears are on the smaller side and I was able to adjust these to fit, and the pearl didn't look too big once it was on. Very cute!"
4.0,"When I ordered this I was channeling my inner Iman. Then, horribly coincidentally, David Bowie died the next day. Weird. This is a statement necklace and is beautiful. My quandary with giving it 5 stars is that it sits at a weird length in my case. Not tight enough to be a choker (thank God) but kind of not long enough to lay flat like the African Queen I imagined I would look like when I ordered it. Delivery was prompt, I was happy with that."
4.0,"Cute hat, good price, but a little small."
4.0,"i ordered this cosplay for myself. for context i‚Äôm about 5‚Äù2, pretty thin, with broader shoulders. i ordered a small, it was my first cosplay and i didn‚Äôt really know to order a larger cosplay, i just checked the sizing chart. the shirt was much too small and i had to wear a normal button up, the corset was too small and broke while i was zipping it, and the shorts were too tight around my thighs. it is pretty good quality, the cape is cute! the hat was a bit of a fuss as i wore it over a wig and it took like 10 minutes to get on properly üò≠ over all, i would order this about 1-2 sizes up for it to fit. another note, the tights are actually thigh highs. if you have more fat around your legs like me you may wanna buy white tights or search for another cosplay with actual tights. happy cosplaying!"
4.0,"The glove came teared, other than that it‚Äôs perfect"
4.0,"Nice shirt, but the body is way too small.  I'm 5'3&#34; and 140 and the large is tight.  I workout everyday and I think the tightness might make it too hot."
4.0,"The only complaint I have is that the pants are a little snug.  However, this will not be a problem/"
4.0,"Good design, good fit just needs thicker fleece lining. Otherwise, a good buy."
4.0,Wow! I had this a long time and there are still holding up and I will definitely order from them again.
4.0,Cute and small purse so overall good.
4.0,"These do a nice job of shutting out the sound when I mow the lawn.  I'm trying to protect my hearing, and these work very nicely to keep out the loud sounds, and they are quite comfortable.  Plus they store tightly together keeping any dirt, dust, or bugs out!!"
4.0,This one is awesome clasp stays closed
4.0,Fits kind of small
4.0,Tighter then expected. Should have measured calfs before I ordered to confirm fit. Great for recovery compression and great quality.
4.0,"The vest is pretty great. Definitely order a size or two larger than usual, I'd say. I'm about six feet tall with a fairly pronounced gut. If I start at the top of the vest, I can button all but the very bottom. I plan on making it into my first battle jacket."
4.0,This Shaw is really sharp. $25 is a steal. I got the black 1 and is true to the picture. I will say 1 thing about the buttons. Their a lil cheap looking but other than that it's perfect! I can't wait for spring to wear.
4.0,Very pretty and unusual looking earrings.  Lots of compliments.
4.0,A gook model for this price i like it
4.0,Did the job. Good value. Shipped quickly
4.0,"One of the things that people don‚Äôt really know about me is that I get panic attacks really bad and sometimes just need a little extra push in doing the stuff that I need to do. This has come in many forms over the years but one this that has always helped is being able to look at a reminder that this is all going to pass and this bracelet has helped in doing that.<br /><br />  QUALITY: The quality of this bracelet is great. The metal is thick enough where it will not bend with normal wear. The leather is also of good quality. The wording is stamped into the metal which is good since any of the jewelry that I have owned that has the words not engraved seems to rub off rather quickly. The clasp is a lobster clasp that is attached to one side of the leather. The other side of the leather is looped into one of the holes on the side of the metal piece of the bracelet.<br /><br />  WORDING: The quote, ‚ÄúYou are Braver than you believe, Stronger thank you seem and Smarter than you think,‚Äù is engraved into the metal. It‚Äôs a great saying and for me is a great reminder that I am better than some of the things that I think about myself. This is great for anyone that deals with anything such as depression, anxiety or even just everyday life.<br /><br />  FIT: As it comes the bracelet was to big on my wrist. I wanted this bracelet to fit flush up against my skin. There are ways to adjust the leather band but all of them require that you untie the leather to make the adjustments. This would be great if there was an easier to way to make the adjustments to this. Not only would this just make it easier to be able to size this so that multiple people can wear it but also the over and over tying and untying make the leather weaker and therefor more prone to breaking.<br /><br />  OVERALL: This is a really good bracelet especially if you are someone like me that suffers from anxiety and just need that little extra piece of encouragement throughout the day. The wording just gives you that little bit of extra fight. This would be a great gift for anyone that is suffering with anything and needs to know that they are worth it and that they are going to be okay.<br /><br />  I¬†received¬†this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion.

4.0,"I absolutely love my shirt. Fits perfect and is very light weight material. I have had tons of compliments, every time I wear it!!"
4.0,These are nice pants. The elastic in the waist is a bit tight. compared to the rest of the pants.
4.0,"I really like the look of this shirt, and it seems to be fairly well made. My only issue is that even with the sizing chart, I was unable to get the perfect fit. I am over 6 feet tall, and right around 250 pounds, so I typically have problems finding shirts that are an exact fit, so I won't count it against the shirt too much."
4.0,Lovely stack of bracelets. Just not very durable. Lost beads after a few wears
4.0,Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ es que los bolsillos se ven abiertos
4.0,"From looking at the pictures of this belt I just had to have it. Once the belt arrived I was a little disappointed in the quality of leather used to make this belt. The leather is what you call a, ‚Äúsplit‚Äù in the leather world. It‚Äôs where a thicker piece of top grain leather is peeled apart from itself to yield more product and thin the leather down. In return you get one piece of top grain and one piece of weaker suede like leather. This belt is made from the later, which in turn makes the belt weaker and thinner. The other problem is it‚Äôs really hard to make out the dragon stamping, because the dye color is so busy. Unless your right up on the belt looking at it you can not tell what‚Äôs stamped on it from a distance. Although it sounds like I‚Äôm trashing this belt for some odd reason I really like it. I think it‚Äôs because of the effort put into making a dragon belt which you don‚Äôt see a lot of in the first place. So ‚ÄúA‚Äù for effort, it just needs a little refining."
4.0,Very cute wallet.
4.0,"Awesome shoes!  Wore them for a 10 mile Spartan Super with zero break-in time.  As soon as I jumped out of the water I could tell the difference between these and regular sneakers - there was virtually no added weight because the water emptied from the shoes immediately.  I wore regular sneakers for my first mud run and as soon as I came out of the water my feet felt very weighed down.  They were also very comfortable, but don't order a size larger as these are sized accurately.  I wear a half size larger in running shoes, but I could have really benefited from a half size smaller on the downhills......<br /><br />As a note of advice, get a good pair of performance (water wicking) socks; thicker cotton socks will weigh you down as well."
4.0,"Adorable, but a bit small, and my granddaughter is tiny!"
4.0,Very nice I am 5'6 and the large was about 2 in. Above my ankle. A little longer would make it a 5 star.
4.0,"For how cheap it was, this romper was great. I ordered it for myself (22 years old) but with how thin the material (it's not see-through, it's just a thin material) is I gave it to my younger sister (14 years old). It fit exactly as expected, and the material is soft, it's just a little bit thin (again, not see-through, it just clings to every curve and bump on your underwear and bra)."
4.0,"I ordered a medium , because that‚Äôs what I usually wear but I am 4‚Äô8 it was a bit big and I hated the way it fit but over all it is a great romper very soft and beautiful"
4.0,"Love these shorts. Very comfy, and light weight perfect for hot summer months. I plan to buy more."
4.0,Great sweatshirt I'd say it runs a bit small but still managed to work around it i wear a medium usually
4.0,Little small for a Lenovo ThinkPad
4.0,Too long otherwise fine
4.0,"Sizing is different for different colors. The red size small was bigger than the tan small. Took off one star b/c the buttons are far apart and gap in certain spots, definitely not for large busts. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 135 34b. Material is soft, lightweight and flows, perfect length for work and easily dressed up"
4.0,"The pi's were really cute, and comfortable, and the price was right.  My only reason for not giving them 5 stars was that they were too long.  Needed to have them shortened.  However, I really like my jammie's!"
4.0,Perfect color and length but thumb holes not sewed very well.
4.0,Fits nice. Shoulder sleeves don‚Äôt stay off shoulder. They pop up when you lift arms. Pattern looks a little cheap
4.0,I really like this body suit. Nice compression. My only complaint is that it seems to run long. I am short and don't have a long torso. Even though there are 3 rows of hooks - it is still too long and sometimes the hook closure don't sit right and I get some chaffing. I pretty much wear one of these every day. I'm 5'3&#34; 109 lbs and this is snug on me - not uncomfortably tight - but as a body shaper would do. I plan on buying more.
4.0,Beautiful jewelry at a good price!
4.0,"I'm usually small size but I had to order medium, that size fit me correctly."
4.0,"Slinky, soft material. Long enough for a tall person. (5 foot 10, size medium). Arm holes are a bit big and the color is supposed to be black, it appeared to be more navy in my lighting."
4.0,"Length was too long for me, so fit was a little off. I think sizing down would be a solution l.  Otherwise it does lift and keep you in place. Very comfortable."
4.0,All good. Thank your for the shoes
4.0,Somewhat large for a petite woman  But it is fine.
4.0,"I am pleased with this purchase. Fits as expected. Ordered up one size to have extra room for layering. Only reason I gave 4 stars was it's a little stiff, doesn't have that relaxed/worn look; but I feel like with time and laundering this will correct itself. I had another jacket like this in my basket that had that look but it wasn't prime and I needed it by Christmas. So I'm happy with my purchase. It was inexpensive too üòÄ"
4.0,Nice.  Ok
4.0,The price is right for these but they fit funny. The front comes up more than the back and they are not super breathable. I bought because I needed the nude color under a white dress and they worked great for that. I wouldn't wear them daily though.
4.0,The dress was beyond what I expected. Fits true to size is made from good material. The colors are vibrant and the dress looks way more expensive than the purchase price. A must buy. Great for any party or just a night out; wedding etc.
4.0,"Liked the dress, but  style did not fit my figure."
4.0,The quality is very nice though I thought it was more of a sport bra with support. You definetly need a bra under the tank.
4.0,"they are nice shoes. My 6 year old is pretty hard on shoes. Next time I'll get some with no laces. These are pretty hard to get on and off, but otherwise, nice shoe."
4.0,"I received the DANNE MORA Women's Short Denim Jacket Casual Fashionable Cropped Black Trucker Jacket in the wrong size so I will do my best to review it fairly. Usually, Amazon gets it right when there are no size options to choose. This time I received a size large. For reference, I typically wear a size small or medium.<br /><br />I have a similar jacket in the correct size in blue denim, and it looks and fits great. Not many woven tops or jackets can accommodate the combination of narrow shoulders and a larger chest and look good. However, this style does.<br /><br />It fit as a size large should. I lost 40 lbs, so I do know. The quality is excellent, and the fabric has a bit of stretch. It falls just at my natural waist. For reference, I am 5'3"" and the length on the arms was just below my wrist bone. The distressed details are not overdone, and It would be a lovely jacket if it were my correct size."
4.0,My teenage son bites his nails. These rings have helped with that. One of the rings is harder to spin but he got them all spinning. He wears one on each hand so he liked this multipack.
4.0,It looked nice and got compliments
4.0,Got this for my trip to Europe over the winter. Great third-layer to help keep you warm!
4.0,"I love the bonnet the softness of it , but the strap brake in all three on the first try."
4.0,"I ordered the 12-18 month size for my 29 month old who wears 18-25 month clothes, but it was too big. I sent it back and got the 6-12 month dress which fit perfectly. The fabric is thin and feels cheap, but the dress was so cute on my LO, I was able to overlook it."
4.0,I like these. The color is nice and bold like the picture. They are soft and comfortable. They fit as expected. I claim 5ft. 4in. 36 bust and 27 waist. I ordered the small size. These are not long in length like some workout tank tops. Nice length though. They hit me in the hip area. They are not compression. I gave 4 stars only because the description says compression but they are not. I like them enough to keep them. I would also recommend these.
4.0,"I would give it five, if i were sure it real, genuine leather, as it claims it is. Also the zipper should be place a little higher up so you can use the pocket for a mobile phone."
4.0,I believe greekevil eye does  are one a believer  in keeping evil spirits away
4.0,"Very nice, looks like an expensive band, easy to install and replace my old rubber fitbit charge band"
4.0,Live the style and color of this jump suit. Material is soft and stretchy and perfect for workouts. Just wish it had lining or cups for bra area so my nips don't show through
4.0,"I love the material and how well it's put together, but I purchased the size based on others reviews and now I wish I hadn't listened to them, because it only just fits and if I loose any weight at all it'll be too big. Based on others reviews I purchased a size 2XL and I'm 5'7&#34;, 175#, and 38DD. I was afraid a 1XL would be too small, but after trying it on I almost wish I had gone with my first instinct."
4.0,"These are soooo comfortable and they fit great. As a plus size rider, it can be irritating to get clothes that fit, look good and are comfortable, but these hit the mark. They are, however, a tad long and I‚Äôm going to probably get that hemmed. I say that despite being a very tall woman with a longer than average inseam."
4.0,It came at the time it said and It does fit and I like that it's adjustable but I put it as the tightest it would go and it comes loose very easily. Other than that it's been great.
4.0,"I've been cycling for 50 years, so I know a thing or two.  Riding in Texas, I don't need long-sleeves very often, and they don't have to be perfect for the few days out of the year when I do need them.  I have some Sugoi bib-tights that are great, but they cost $150.  These bibs were surprisingly good considering the price.  Some reviews said they were tight, so I went with a size larger -- they're okay -- just a little looser than I like -- but definitely good enough.  If I get another pair, I'll probably get the XL that I usually wear.  Chamois is fine -- a little thicker than I usually ride, but they seem to be breaking in fairly well.  They're warm; zippers seem strong.  If I had one complaint (and again -- at this price, I'm really not complaining), I wish the bibs didn't come up quite so high in the front.  It makes it a little hard to take a ""natural break."""
4.0,"Great material, fitted as expected. I'm 5'9 and weigh 190lb so I got an X-large, only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because it's a tad to short, I can't bend over without exposing my backside."
4.0,"Love the fit and very comfortable. As the picture shows one leg has silver dots, the other has gold. Weird, but not a deal breaker."
4.0,It's a nice shirt
4.0,"The pants is beautiful and fits as expected with the exception that it was a little long for me and I'm 5'2"". I purchased the XS and wasn't able to wear flats but it worked with a 2"" healed sandals"
4.0,Good packaging
4.0,The lace was good quality for the price.
4.0,Cute but buy a size bigger.. runs small
4.0,"Strap could be longer, and too bulky overears ‚ÄºÔ∏è"
4.0,It fits good..... although I wish It were a bit tighter.
4.0,"I love this jersey. I prefer full zip fronts, the sleeveless option is a priority right now since it is so hot in OK. There are three pockets, but they are small and the elastic on side is super tight while the other side is not. Seems weird, but not enough to send back. I love the graphics and the amount of spandex."
4.0,"The dress looks as expected. It comes sort of folded in a plastic bag, so it will be wrinkled. It lost one star because the ribbon has fringe."
4.0,Was a little smaller than I thought
4.0,"Not quite what I expected.  A liittle big, but other than that I like them."
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for.  Inexpensive, easy to read."
4.0,I love the fit and they are very comfortable
4.0,Great cable for allowing a battery pack or any other USB based charging device to charge you 3DS.
4.0,"I like the watch, but the time is just a little bit hard to see."
4.0,"Cute bracelets, but i thought both would say sickle cell, but cute none the less....."
4.0,They are a little too heavy for my like.
4.0,Wonderful.too large.
4.0,Really small but I‚Äôm going to add stuff to them to make them pretty ! Will do the job for my Halloween costume üòú
4.0,this worked great on my trip! folded down to fit in my carry on too...lightweight & waterproof too!
4.0,Very nice pouch.
4.0,"I bought them for walking and some resistance training. They looks small out the package but they fit well. I got a medium 5'1"" 165ish and a mom tummy. They pull me in and didn't slide down or bunch up in the crotch. Overall I would buy them again."
4.0,A little frustrated that this is actually from Shein. I've made a point not to give them my money because of their practices. I feel deceived in it being drop shipped. The set is not a high quality set by any means but it will do.
4.0,"Cute socks, but both the bears are on the same side of the sock. Like, they both face left. I think it's just two of the same sock."
4.0,We used it as decoration in our child's nursery. Looks great and arrived quickly. It was a good purchase!
4.0,"These stay in place, are not huge or hard and give just the right degree of lift."
4.0,"Works well, but got run in them on the first day"
4.0,"The Flex Capacitor is very nearly the ‚Äúdo-it-all‚Äù pack, with very few shortcomings. It is simply designed, with just enough bells and whistles to be both comfortable and functional. It is lightweight for its carrying capacity and has an ability to manage a wide variety of equipment: skis, backpacking equipment, ice tools, ropes; you pack it, the Flex Capacitor will carry it.<br /><br />With a few slight improvements, this pack could be nearly perfect:<br /><br />Increase the size of the upper zipper pocket to function more like a brain. The current pocket is too small to really be fully functional.<br />Re-design the external straps to have pivot points where they are threaded through the pack, rather than being one continuous strap. The current design just threads the outside straps through two metal eyelets, which makes it a guessing game which side of the strap you have tightened down."
4.0,This outfit is cute. Not a fan of the pin on bowtie. Green color is off but fits and looks cute.
4.0,Pretty nice shirt was long sleeve but I roll the sleeve up love the design
4.0,Beautiful color.  Has A LOT of fabric in the skirt.
4.0,Love the skirt!  The pockets - the fabric - the print.  Just had to return it because I think the product size chart was a little off.  I'm 5'1&#34; and 135# and ordered a large.  The waist was too big and the skirt too full.
4.0,Came with a very small snag. But decent quality and much cheaper than department stores!
4.0,The straps do exactly what I expected. I use them on my tote bag and my oxygen bottle carry bag.
4.0,"Purchased for my granddaughter. She really liked it. Hoping it would be a dark<br />purple but it is a beautiful cranberry color. It definitely won't work for her to<br />wear in the wedding(wanted purple) but she'll wear it as a Christmas dress.<br />It fits well. She says its comfortable. Good length. Use size guide when ordering to get<br />a good fit-order by measurement, not size."
4.0,The product was great. Just as heavy as I thought it would be. It doesn't get scratched or marred. It is a very strong ring. They did size the ring a half size larger then normal though. I didn't find that out till after I bought it.
4.0,Nice looking but definitely buy above your size as it does run much smaller than expected
4.0,"Works good. Kind of awkward to carry as the handles are too large so it drags on the ground. It can sure use shoulder straps.  It's light duty and after using it to ship a 32&#34; tv and other items, on the return flight back, there is a small tear already."
4.0,Size as advertised--what I couldn't tell when I ordered it from the picture is that the pommel of this sword is a cat's head.
4.0,I love these glasses but they are too big for my head. I had to have them adjusted at my Optical location.
4.0,I love the earrings and I get quite the compliments on them. The only thing is that the backs don't stay on very well.
4.0,Beautiful statement necklace but I returned it because it was missing a clasp.
4.0,Love this purse.  It‚Äôs an authentic coach and it‚Äôs leather.  The color is oxblood.  I am wearing it on my shoulder with the longer strap.  The short strap was too short.  I like to get things in and out easily.  The front zippers hold my keys.  See pic.  I absolutely love this purse.  I purchased from 6pm via amazon.  Came wrapped very well and quickly. EDIT: can‚Äôt recommend this bag because the crossbody clasp that holds the bag on both sides has come loose twice now and my stuff has ended up on the floor.  Not reliable! It‚Äôs possible I received a defective bag.  May try a different color.
4.0,The dress is very pretty but it has no stretch whats so ever I would recommend to size up
4.0,I got this as a gift for my dad he loves it! Says it‚Äôs helpful with shading and cooling off at work !
4.0,nice but loose size small
4.0,Good product but I was hoping it would take off all scratches. It took off 75% of all tiny scratches from my watches.
4.0,"I think I need this dress in every color! It‚Äôs true to size and very comfortable. The only downside is the belt doesn‚Äôt fit, but the belt isn‚Äôt good quality anyway and I would not have used it. Overall I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase!"
4.0,I love these sweatpants but they are extremely long that's why I gave the four stars and cannot even wear with flip flops better off tucked in my boot slippers
4.0,"Material is a little thin, but still very comfortable."
4.0,"Great colors, except 2 pairs, the rest fit as expected."
4.0,"Made for super short people, but soft, comfy, and Wonder Woman!!!!"
4.0,Good and nice luggage
4.0,"Size small. 120lbs, 5 flat. It was hard trying to find a bra and keep it covered but it worked out. Lots of compliments."
4.0,"I took this on a high-altitude hike spanning 2 weeks in the back country of New Mexico.<br /><br />The wicking feature was phenomenal. Normally, when I use sunscreen on my face, some invariably washes down into my eyes when I sweat. When I was wearing this hat after applying the sunscreen, I had no problems.<br /><br />It is a very comfortable, very breathable item and the reflective band is very bright at night. Fellow hikers reported being able to pick up the cap from a long way off - 50-75 feet - with their headlamps (so don't wear this is your goal is to not be seen!).<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the reflective piping around the brim and edges is not as durable as the cap material itself. After just 2 weeks of continuous use, it is starting to show signs of wear right where the brim meets the crown of the cap."
4.0,It's very cute and nice especially considering the price. However the straps are not adjustable and so the fit is a bit off for me.
4.0,"Sweat shirts, looks and feel good, after several washes,  fade a little, I would buy again different color"
4.0,"Comes as the flat brim hat, has to be bent to make a curved brim hat. Color changes nice. Somewhat large but looks cool."
4.0,This is a very beautiful dress and beautiful color.  However I had to return it because it ran smaller than Iv expected. For reference I'm 5'7 165 lbs and ordered a medium after reading reviews. I should have ordered a large instead.
4.0,Love the way this skirt fits - as expected. You can dress it up or wear it casually. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Very cute. Runs a bit small in the waist and the waist seam is a bit itchy, but SO cute! I get lots of compliments on this. It took some heavy ironing to get the creases from shipping out, but it doesn't crease or wrinkle easily. The fabric is quite thick, and kind of stiff, so it is quite full. My chief complaint is that the back elastic on the waistband makes the back waist look lumpy. I wanted to wear a blouse tucked in, but even with a belt, the elastic looks puckered, so I belt it outside. But overall, great fabric, just as pictured, decently made, great value."
4.0,"I purchased this as a possibly going home outfit for our son, however it is very large. Holding it up to the other clothing I have, it is actually more like 3-6 month clothing, and in some places even larger. I am keeping it, and I will still use for when he's a little bigger, but beware this is not suitable for a newborn outfit."
4.0,"The looks very nice and could be stretch near to hip.  BF love the see through appearance. Meanwhile they are quite fragile, not suitable for everyday wear."
4.0,This dress fits true to size and looks elegant for the price.
4.0,A little hard to open and close but it‚Äôs cute. It‚Äôs a functioning umbrella and keeps the rain off of me.
4.0,Comfort with style
4.0,"Fit is good, just know there is a spelling mistake to differentiate from the real thing.  Supposed to say paradise on left leg."
4.0,"i would consider this a woman's large.  too small for me so I gave it to my brother in law and it barely fit him too.  fabric felt ok, heat felt nice.  only thing that was bothering me besides the smaller than expected size was the zipper on the wrong side"
4.0,"It was a gift and did not hear the comment of any .<br />I did pick the socks , it looks dorable and economical ."
4.0,"These shoes were of good quality for the price.  My daughter liked them.  She said they were comfortable, but I was sent the wrong size (too big).  Unfortunately, they didn't have her size in stock."
4.0,As expected.  And they arrived quick!
4.0,another inch or two in the waist and I would have been happier
4.0,ƒ∞t is a good sunglasses as the price. It is cheaper and quaty
4.0,"I'm really small up top, so the top was loose around my rib cage, and the bottoms were a little tight is some places, but not enough to not wear it! I get lots of compliments on the colors!"
4.0,"Nice tank. Material is soft, doesn't feel cheap. Very sexy. I gave 4 stars because zipper appears bigger in pic. It seems to me to be a regular size zipper. The pic looked much bigger unless it's just way it photographed."
4.0,Really cute. Incredibly soft material.
4.0,"Great--holds everything neatly, the magnet latch over the phone is very secure.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a small area for coins."
4.0,These are well made and lovely. My only complaint us that they sit our too far from my earlobe. Not earrings to wear if you wear an earpiece at work.
4.0,My five year old loves it. She calls it her Fitbit because it tracks her steps.
4.0,Run small  Had to return for next larger size.
4.0,Fun and funky top layer. Great as beach cover up or better as tunic with cuffed jeans and sandals.
4.0,This is a light weight sweater which is great to wear over another top. Nice addition to my work wardrobe. The only down side is that the sleeves are a little snug. I tried it on over a short sleeved T-shirt. Not sure how it will feel with long sleeves. I bought an XL.
4.0,"Good bracelet and awesome price. These usually sell for $29.99 on Power Balance's website. I did not buy them with the intent of them improving my balance, coordination and all that other junk. Just brought it for looks and so far so good."
4.0,Order up because its almost two size smaller.
4.0,"This swim suit fit as expected based on the reviews I read. I was worried about buying a suit that couldn 't be bought separately because my chest is smaller than my bottom, I normally wear a 36 B and the XXL fit fine, I probably would have been better with an XL on top. I haven't gone in the water with it yet, so I am not sure how it will do in the water with my toddler. The bottoms fit fine in the XXL and I wear size 8/10/12 depending on the store, usually a 10."
4.0,My daughter loved most of the designs. At least 2 pairs were gender neutral or something I would purchase for my son so my daughter doesn't precisely like those two.
4.0,"Boy friend loves this sweater. It is bright and didn't shrink when I washed it, but the quality is so so"
4.0,"I liked the purse, but I didn‚Äôt realize it was small!"
4.0,Would hightly recommend this to others. Fits comfortably
4.0,"The dress has a small side bow in the front. But the big bow is a clip on. Which is super glued to the pin, that you use to clip it on the dress. The bow fell off the clip and the needle too. Other than that it definitely is big for a 6 month old. We had to hold it up from the back for my 8 month old, so the straps wont fall over the shoulder."
4.0,I picked this necklace over the other brand because it was sterling silver. The constellation was cute but very small. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I wished that the constellation part of it was a little bigger. I still will wear it. It's so unique looking.
4.0,Shipped quickly. Very nice fit. I will be wearing this on my cruise .It look very nice with demi capris and also leggings.
4.0,"The colors are great.  I don't like the elastic in the band, but that was easily removed."
4.0,One of the lenses keeps falling out
4.0,"I love these leggings! They‚Äôre decently priced and very very soft/comfortable. My only only issue is that they are ever so slightly see through, not terrible but enough that you definitely cannot wear these as pants, you will want your top to at least cover your butt unless you go commando or wear a thong (which is doable, you can‚Äôt see through enough for it to be scandalous) totally not an issue for me as I almost always wear long shirts but just a heads up!"
4.0,"They were huge and no,small available"
4.0,We just received these yesterday.  They fit my 3 1/2 YO daughter's hands well.  The fabric has enough stretch that they would fit an older child too.  They seem like they will be warm enough for the conditions we will experience (temps 20 deg. F and higher).  We checked to see if the finger tips could be used to operate an IPad and that worked as well.<br /><br />My concern with the gloves are the quality.  Some of the faux fur lining came off the first time we put them on our daughter.  I will follow up this review in a few weeks to update how the gloves are aging.
4.0,It's decent quality and a very cool shirt. Though it does run large.
4.0,The color in the photo is a bit off--they look like a grey but they are really black. However I've had these for two winters and they have held up well. I love them.
4.0,The stone is not as large as it looks in the picture. Still a beautiful ring though!
4.0,"This dress is extremely comfortable to wear, and the pockets are great. I have gotten many compliments on the dress. I took off a star because the fabric started fading and pilling after the first time I washed it."
4.0,Kids like them. Super easy to attach masks but the lanyard side doesn‚Äôt stay on the hook. There are slits on both sides of the hook and the lanyard tends to slip off. We‚Äôve already cracked one putting the lanyard back on.. (photo added to help with confusion on my wording!)
4.0,"1 star less just for the design issue<br />This is my 4th purchase, (gray, black and blue/green design with larger pocket in front  and wine in this design) however, the style with the larger pocket in the front is my favorite. The little pocket on left has no purpose for me...the larger middle pocket I could carry things<br />Soft, comfortable Fits great I'm 5' 5 1/2 "" 120 lbs. Baggy as they should be<br />Noticed, they put the buttons INSIDE to hold the straps this purchase.<br />WASH in a little laundry bag. My button came off on black pair.<br />Working in the garden, hanging out, even shopping, it's quite versatile.<br />COTTON and LINEN was another +<br />Wanted white, which is not available in small, saw one style online was only 30% cotton<br />Overall LOVE it!"
4.0,"Nice looking pants, but ran small."
4.0,"HUGE was looking for something a bit more subtle but that is on me the piece is flawless, great piece"
4.0,But a nice product
4.0,"Much thinner material than I expected,  Not exactly suitable for plus size women. But will work for what I need it for."
4.0,Love the purse. Not what I was expecting but definitely going to recommend this purse.
4.0,"These are 16g so I never got to use them, but I gave one to my friend and they liked it"
4.0,"I actually really like the small size of this, it is very delicate. Don't expect a statement piece with this one, the ""dots"" are 2.5mm at best. My wrists are on the smaller side so the tails were a little long for my taste. I just knotted them and cut the rest off. Just used a little super glue so the knots wouldn't come undone."
4.0,Not the kind of bag that I really like. It's just okay. Simple.
4.0,"This is a nice hoody - good price, great quality and warm. As a 5-5&#34; 135 lb. woman, the boys XL fits me perfectly. My only complaint is the way the logo is sewn on makes it appear a little bit off-center. However, I would highly recommend it. I'm game ready!"
4.0,"Overall this dress wears pretty well.  My issue is that for a sized 16 body an XL will fit snug in certain areas.  This dress tops out at size XL; I really wish they offered bigger sizes..  So I had to take it or leave it...I took it.  However, it pulls a little at the shoulders and bunches a little in the upper back (not the most flattering look).  And not the most comfy to wear, but I rocked it.  I love the material and design.  It has a silky-satiny feel and does not wrinkle.  Great for summer get-a-ways and the beach.  For reference: 220 lbs; 38-40D; 5'-10"".  I included the Amazon pic for comparison to see where I had to compromise to wear this dress.  Note the drape and length at the sleeves, also it looks a bit shorter on me.  All-in-all it is pretty, flirty, bold and funky and fun look to wear."
4.0,I liked the overall look. The fabric wasn‚Äôt pokey. My arms are a little long so the sleeves were a little short for me.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:becb08b33396c111832e2523aa18335c]] I loved the shades don‚Äôt get me wrong! The only issue was a few had scratches on them and some were a little loose. But, other than that they are very stylish! ü§ç"
4.0,"I bought several of these as bachelorette party favors. For the price, I expected not great quality, but they are well made and I was pleasantly surprised by fabric."
4.0,fit as expected...good!
4.0,"I purchased the band in late October and it's torn (but still usable) in late May. I would still say I got my money's worth. It's very easy to swap out the band but it never releases on it's own. I am not a fan of silicone or thick watch bands, so this is perfect and very comfortable. Very much worth the purchase even though it didn't last the life of the watch."
4.0,"I don‚Äôt know my cup size but if this is your first zip front bra, it takes some getting use to. I have to tuck the ladies into the side to be able to zip the front."
4.0,"The bag had a nice design and color is accurate. I ended up getting rid of it though because it was very stiff and I could not put my things in it without feeling like I had to break the bag. If you just need it to hold a thin wallet and a phone, it will work. Otherwise, I recommend to keep looking."
4.0,This is a one-piece romper. It has short sleeves and the sleeves are lace. It is gathered at the waistline with elastic. The neckline can be worn like a scoop neck or you can wear it off the shoulders. I put on a silver belt and it looks great. Good outfit for a summer barbecue. This romper fits true to size.
4.0,Nice pants at a good price.
4.0,"I purchased an xxl and while it is comfortable and cute, it is not the same as other xxls I have purchased.  It fits perfectly now with a little wiggle room but I am worried it will shrink alot since it's cotton. I was hoping it would be larger than it is for comfort."
4.0,It's a great product!
4.0,Really cute for the price
4.0,"I purchased several dresses for a medieval event and although I didn‚Äôt wear this one, I decided to keep for future events as it was a great dress."
4.0,"the gloves are great, light weight but protect skin from sun."
4.0,Ran small.  Would have kept but needed true 3x
4.0,"I love the cut and fit of this. The material is comfortable but a little lacking in appearance. It‚Äôs not bad but could be a little nicer, just looks slightly cheap but that will not keep me from wearing it as I love everything else about it."
4.0,This wallet is stiff as was mentioned by other reviewers.
4.0,Bought it for my secret Santa and she loves it
4.0,I don't like the band
4.0,"The decal smelled like pine sol, but the smell came out(mostly) after a few washes. Fits great"
4.0,"I love the fabric, pattern, and length on this dress! So comfortable. I'm hoping I just got the wrong size because the top part doesn't fit right. If a smaller size doesn't correct the issue I'll be returning it for good. Hopefully the next one is the perfect fit."
4.0,A definite recommendation .....
4.0,Great ring but size runs small. Ordered a nine and it is more like a 7.
4.0,"I just received the package in the mail yesterday. And it looks very durable. I can't wait to use it in my next travel. I like the  height of the cubes. I have couple cubes from a different company those are very short in height and long in length, verses these that are taller in height and shorter in width. And the pouches I'll be using for other purpose. The zipper I wish had a string on them. But overall they look study.<br /><br />Recent update: I just received from the seller/company several extension zippers to attach to the zipper of the cubes and it made a huge difference. I used it for the first time on my recent trip. And it was much easier to zip and unzip and easier to locate as well. The shape of the cubes held up really well too. And the pouches came in handy for any of my dirty or wet laundry. I used the smaller one to hold any electronic plugs. The color was very neutral too. The seller was very accommodating and I would buy from them again."
4.0,"Other than the sleeves being a little too long, the fit is good.  Very nice wool blend navy vlazer."
4.0,This beanie is not really what I was expecting.  It is not the thicker knit type but instead it is pretty thin.  Ok for medium cold or as a substitute for a hat.
4.0,"This is the second item I‚Äôve purchased from this company, and like the first, I am very pleased. It is larger than I thought it would be and it looks very sturdy, which is good when the recipient is a little girl. The chain is also adjustable, which is a big plus for me!"
4.0,"This coat is a great snowboarding and winter coat. Everything on it works well except the exterior chest pocket zipper broke on the first day. For the money, I can live without it.<br /><br />The size chart was spot on. very uncommon for foreign clothing."
4.0,"I was so excited to see how beautiful these earrings were when they arrived.  Very well packaged and arrived in perfect shape.  Unfortunately, the first time I tried them on, I bent the post trying to get the back on.  The post is not sturdy and the backs are either too small or made with an inferior material.  So sad, they are so pretty."
4.0,They are not as firm as I would like them to be but they do the job for my jeans and my cammies. The buckle is nice but it is a pain to remove every time you change your pants.
4.0,Haven't actually worn it yet beyond trying it on to make sure it fits but fits true to size
4.0,"After reading the reviews and learning that the jacket runs small, I ordered an XXL. I normally wear a M. The XXL fits nicely in sleeve length. It is slightly tight in the shoulders so I can't wear a heavy sweater under it. But...I love it for over work out clothes. It works as a windbreak and insulator from the cold after a workout when I need to get all of the errands done in my work out clothes."
4.0,good quality!!
4.0,Good band. Replaced a nasty old leather one and turned my timex into a brand new watch
4.0,"Nice quality material, well made, a little large for size just makes it slouchy."
4.0,Got for my daughter who loves this brand of purse.  She loved it.  Spaces for her new phone in outside pockets & even a small umbrella inside.  Only wish it had a zippered top!
4.0,Everything ok! Thanks. Is beatiful
4.0,Good Google and gives good vision.  The one reason for 4 stars is because if you don't keep them in the case they scratch very easily.  Sometimes this isn't airways realistic I'd you are hanging by the pool and taking them on and off.  Other then that they are great goggles
4.0,A little on the heavy side and the backs don't hold the earing on. I had to switch with different ones I had.
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes too big.  Very nice dress otherwise.
4.0,I first and foremost love the shirts.  Recently I attempted to add a fifth shift to my collection.  Upon opening the package by hand I noticed the plastic on the outside of the shirt had a small slit cut in it over the chest about 1&#34; long.  It appeared it was cut by some type of utility knife.  I packaged it up and mailed it out the same day.  The shirts do run small.  I am 6'3&#34; 210lbs and I use an 2XL.  I tried an XL however it was to tight.  The 2XL is perfect.
4.0,my average height 6yr old loves them and doesn‚Äôt mind that they‚Äôre a bit short and rise above his ankles. it only bothers me a little.
4.0,Very cute need shorts or leggings pretty short
4.0,I bought this for myself and I wear the top two together with another stackable ring with. After awhile the silver coating rubbed off to expose a copper color which is disappointing. I still wear them bc rose gold is trendy.
4.0,Was a tad bit disappointed in the graphics quality but Amazon has resolved the problem quite well. Foam insert is not fastened completely to the shell so tends to pull out when taking the helmet off. Strap could be of better quality but overall a good helmet. The retractable visor really makes it work.
4.0,I was pretty impressed with the quality. I used these for a few cartilage piercing I have. They have given me no problems and I have sensitive ears.
4.0,"It's starting to tarnish a bit after several months.  Still looks okay though, and it was cheap so I didn't really expect it to last forever."
4.0,"Nice replacement band. Considerably softer and more pliable than the OEM Samsung band, as others have stated, which makes it a little more comfortable to wear. This band is slightly smaller than the OEM large as I have to adjust it out one more hole to fit properly. I had no problem installing the band it fit the watch as good as the OEM with a nice positive snap in place. I believe this band will stay in place during most activities because I was not able to make it come loose with a reasonable amount of tugging or twisting. I only wish I could find someone that makes a band slightly larger than the OEM as I have large wrists, but the soft pliable material of this band did really improve comfort over the original. I will probably buy a few more in different colors just to change things up from time to time.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Great for sun exposure
4.0,"I have a lot of issues with my feet and legs some days my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk that being said since I got these it‚Äôs been SO much better! I have only had two days since getting these that I have struggled to move around and that was my fault, I took them off and fell asleep giving my feet time to swell. They do make the outer corner of my big toes a little sore after wearing them for a while but small potatoes compared to my usual pain! I LOVE the pattern since my feet started this is been a lot of flesh tones and zippers that bite into my skin. These have been a true gift! They are soft and although it‚Äôs harder to get them on without a zipper I‚Äôll take that any day over a zipper biting into my already sore legs! They keep the swelling down and make my feet and legs feel SO much better! If you are pregnant, traveling, on your feet a lot, or just have issues with swelling like me you really can‚Äôt go wrong with these socks!"
4.0,Give me more time to actually try product.<br />Then I will update at a later time.
4.0,Cannot say as I have  not  worn them  outdoors.
4.0,"Sized a little small but very pretty.  It's a very nice, casual ring."
4.0,"I looooove this chain. I'm so glad it hasn't gone out of style yet, I feel like a real OG when I wear this lol. I just wish it was thicker and not so thin and feminine, I wanted a chain that would make Mr. T jealous!"
4.0,Beware: Watermelon is HOT pink. Was hoping for more of a red/pink. I like pink so I'm not wasting my time sending them back. But I can definitely see someone being not as happy. Otherwise good brand.
4.0,"These pants were very loose at the ankles, waist etc.. they were loose on me despite an XS size"
4.0,"Comfortable glasses for mountain bike riding. I wasn't sure if the blue on the arms were rubberized. It is, for those who like that. I had to cut it off because the rubber rips my hair out. But they still stay on my head with no issues. Changing lenses is easy, it just takes a bit of finessed strength to not break them at the same time."
4.0,"These headbands are rad, but I only have one gripe:  they shed quite a bit.  Other than that, they hold hair in place, look pretty good (bright colors), have held up well (a year now), and are inexpensive.  Solid.  I like these because they are neither too think nor too narrow, and cheap enough to give away or not care about if they are lost or destroyed.<br /><br />Also my girlfriend had an issue at first with the smell too (Chinese manufacturing), so maybe a wash first would take care of the shedding issue and the smell.  I didn't notice the smell before she pointed it out, so you may not care."
4.0,The dress is very cute! A little shorter than pictured especially if you have assets.
4.0,This is my first time buying clothing on Amazon and I was pretty nervous not being able to try the dress on.  For the price though... I gave it a go.  This dress is super cute and has definite potential.  It does have fewer pleats than you see in the image but still fits well and has a flattering cut.  I will however say that the neckline is a little higher than I personally would have liked.  The fabric is stretchy whch is a plus and adds to the fit.  I am a curvy 5'4&#34; and weigh about 170... so I was very unsure what size to order based on the reviews.  I would typicaly wear a XL but ordered a 2X expecting it to be too large.  It fits like a glove though... so this dress is obviously made on the small side...  The dress was longer than I was expecting but that is easy to hem.  Ultimately I am pleased with this dress and would recommend it for those looking for an affordable retro ensamble.  I would definitely recommend you buy larger than you think though.
4.0,"They run a little big,  but are quite pretty and comfortable. Will order more in other colors."
4.0,Good dress but the material is a little cheap. I do wear it occasionally and its comfy
4.0,Okay; a little hard to fasten without some help
4.0,"This is a soft scarf made from modal fabric. It is really a simple cut of a tube of fabric, with the edges left raw. Due to the type of fabric, the edges roll inward so you won't see the raw edges when wearing it. The reason I removed one star is that it's called &#34;dark olive&#34; when in fact it is a light/medium sage color, so not what I was going for. Still it is a comfortable and warm scarf, and it hangs very well."
4.0,"I'm a 32 G and I ordered the Medium. The medium fits well. Of course, I only intend to do yoga in this bra and wear this bra around the house. I would not be supported running in it. The only thing that would improve this bra for me would be a longer band, but this is an issues I would only see bigger busted ladies having. For the price this bra is fantastic and works as a lounge or yoga bra for bigger busted ladies."
4.0,"Dress is a little less fitted in the waist than I expected, but still comfortable. I've only tried it on and haven't worn it for any length of time yet."
4.0,I would have kept it if it was a bit bigger. I tried it on and was hoping that I could  make an adjustment.  It is a beautiful bracelet.
4.0,"Good wallet, but I am thanks its need more blockings from the tarjets"
4.0,"My husband bought me the short version and they are still long.  I'm 5'4&#34;.  They also run large in the waist.  Very soft, though."
4.0,"Love these so much Ive bought more than a dozen of them. I wear a large, 48 chest, 32 waist, 200lbs"
4.0,"Fits as expected. I wear a 38C and ordered the C cup.  It has a small pocket, I assume to help your &#34;girls&#34; breath, which is nice. It dosent support much, but I needed mine just to cover the essentials parts in a sheer top.  It did give me some extra cleavage."
4.0,I play Roy Orbison on stage and it is the perfect finish to my costume!
4.0,"The style is great so I kept the dress but it was a little large. Also, the zipper was sewn in poorly so the fabric is bubbly by the zipper which happens to be on the hip. I don't know about you but a bubbly hip is not attractive to me. I will have to take the zipper out and resew it in. I will also have to take it in just a bit because the small is still a little too big. I am 5'6&#34;, 125lbs, 32B."
4.0,"Replaced the original SKX007K2 jubilee band with this band. I am very happy. I was annoyed at the original band with the first link weak connectors always seeming to bend/stretch. The screw link pins make this watch a dream to size at a slight aesthetic loss. The clasp mechanism engages and releases easily. Band looks great on the watch. I want to be clear I like this band.<br /><br />There were some minor fixable issues, mostly aesthetic, that added up to the -1 star (seriously 1/8 star issues each), because I think they can be addressed:<br /><br />1. The end link angle comes down slightly too sharply toward the wrist in my opinion. Not very noticable, but it breaks up the natural curve of the band when wearing it. I do not have an overly large wrist causing this. I think most would not notice or care about this. This may match the original Seiko angle for this style of band, so may not be wrong.<br /><br />2. The end link does not fit fully flush with the lugs on the watch body. Not sure if there is variance in the SKX007XX models/years/style or if this is intended, but it sticks out a bit past the lugs toward the band. The top is pretty flush, and the curve matches the body, which matters waaay more.<br /><br />3. The clasp, I was confused between the models, I thought it had an extension. It does not. Maybe I was confused by the new (to me) release mechanism style.<br /><br />4. The clasp, the final locking portion of the clasp. The detent should be stronger and it can rattle a bit if you tap it. Functionally it works, but could come loose if catching or as it ages.<br /><br />5. The clasp. Just seems a bit bulky or thick or long compared to some other watch bands I have. It just seems to stand out a fair bit more than others. Wish it was slightly smaller or thinner or shorter?? I can't  exactly identify why it stands out to my eye a bit more than others.<br /><br />6. Color/polish. It looks good, but I think a bit more polish or color change matches this particular watch body better.<br /><br />Okay. None of the above is really noticeable or bothersome, just pointing them out since there are few reviews on this model, if any of the above bothers you. It really does look good and make me happy. Functionally it works well. If I had to replace another band I would not be shy buying it again or finding a similar model from this company."
4.0,My husband loves these shorts perfect length
4.0,I bought them for sleeping in.  So it's okay.  I don't know whether to tell you not to order a tall man or to just go down a size.
4.0,"I'm 5'2 and 100lbs for reference and I usually wear a small in most brands. I ordered these a size up after reading all the reviews and they fit pretty well although they are a little looser than expected. I could have gotten my usual size and it would have given me the tighter fit I was hoping for. However, the quality is really good and the material is soft and like stretchy cotton which is a real plus because I was worried thy would be basketball shorts material. Overall, a great value for a cute, comfy pair of shorts. I got 3 pairs."
4.0,"I have really big calves so I didn't expect the boots to fit, but they actually conform to my oddly shaped legs anyway and look phenomenal! Planning to use these bad boy's for some killer cosplay!"
4.0,So cool. Fit great around waist and hips.
4.0,I wear a 16 so ordered a us size 20 because it is a sweat shirt and wanted to were it over a shirt.  However it is quite snug and can not wear it even with a t-shirt.
4.0,Nice shirt but too small
4.0,As a breast cancer survivor I made this purchase to remind myself never to forget my warrior sisters out there who still fighting a terrible disease. The bracelet came quickly and I am very happy with it.
4.0,I gifted this one and they love it
4.0,"They're pretty warm and cozy. The missing star is because little balls are formed very easily, you have to remove them in order to keep the gloves looking new."
4.0,Super cute. Feels good in my hands while using my phone! 4 stars only because I‚Äôm wondering if the decals will wear off but you can‚Äôt beat the price.
4.0,They fit to size.<br />They are comfortable and nicely made. Shipping was fast.<br />I just wish the front wasn't mesh because that's a little uncomfortable sometimes.<br />The pouch should be a little bigger as well.
4.0,"My 4 year old son loves it. However, he has difficulty pressing the thing to make the ears flop."
4.0,"My Stats: A little under 5'5 and about 140 pounds.  I wear a size 36/38 B cup and I have wide hips and a small butt.  I purchased a medium and it is just a tad bit small when it comes to tying the top in the back (I should have followed the size chart) but I don't think I will return it.  The bathing suit looks great and the price is perfect.  A large would have been a better fit (with the strings on bottom and top in the Large I could have just tightened them to fit me).  The strings on the medium suit in the back don't have much space (so I can't gain any weight..as you can see in the picture).<br />Also, the blue is a bright blue, not a dark blue as is seen in the actual american flag, which doesn't really matter to me.  I love this bathing suit and the bright colors, perfect for any hot sunny day.  I also love the rouched back bottom, gives my small butt a little volume."
4.0,"Super cute and were light weight. Loved They came with plastic backings. Fast delivery and all looks great. Only issue was pink earrings were NOT pink, they were more a peachy color. Still cute but not my color so I gave them away. They very pretty üòç"
4.0,"I had a different one of these I had bought at Walmart a few years back, it was thick and super fluffy then it came up missing. So I began my search for a new one. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not as thick and fluffy as I'd like it to be, but it works...I really like the button at the top that's one thing the one from Walmart didn't have"
4.0,Beautifully made.Can't wait to wear at Holidays
4.0,"It is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, wide like a man's watch. I've gotten used to the size and get daily compliments on it."
4.0,"I've only had them a week, but they seem pretty durable for a cheap pair of sunglasses. Love the cat eye. They are real light weight. I wish they were a little more gradient."
4.0,really cute!  Professional.  Order a size up
4.0,My son loved this short and said it was really soft! Said it was one of his favorite Christmas gifts.
4.0,Really cute yet not well made. The buttons will not stay closed.
4.0,"Overall, these leggings fit comfortably, hug my skin, and smooth out the tummy pudge. I'm 129lb 5'4"" with a 39"" hip. I have bought 5 pairs in size small. My inseam is 26"" but this is 29"" but I don't mind the bunching since the material at the ankle is narrow.<br />The Colors and design are true the pictures this far. I love the pockets on the sides. When I jog or jump around they do wiggle down slightly on the tummy but not necessarily in the thigh area. When I squat, they cover and so far nothing appears see through. I included picture of the black one, came with two tiny holes in the leg netting, I was dreading that. It's bound to happen at some point."
4.0,looks like it would have cost much more
4.0,"I bought these in a 7 and 10. The 7 for me fit perfectly so I would say that the 7 is true to size. I love my rings! My husband says that his size 10 rings are a bit too snug. I think the 11 would probably be too big and the 9 would probably be too small. Having half sizes would help a lot here because full sizes make it hard to get the right fit. We haven't returned the size 10 because it really isn't worth it - he COULD wear them if he HAD to but that isn't really the need here. I gave these five stars because my size 7 fits perfectly, and I subtracted one star because his size 10 are too snug. Other comments: another review said that they ordered two sizes and the colors weren't the same on the larger versus smaller widths; they appear to have fixed that issue because our sets were the same color for each color of the rainbow. The rings kind of disappear - I forget I'm wearing it because it is pretty comfortable."
4.0,"I am reviewing the the 4th generation badges.<br /><br />As a kid I grew up playing Pokemon and while I'm older I still love the series, so to be able to acquire real life gym badges is just an amazing thing. The badges fit as intended and I recently wore one to work (nothing but complements), so it's not too obviously Pokemon if you wanna wear it out somewhere.<br /><br />Now I will voice disappointment in at least two of the badges. The Relic Badge (bottom row, 3rd) and the Mine Badge (top row, 4th) have incorrect colors. While all badges having gold instead of silver coloring is incorrect, it is an acceptable choice in style, but the above mentioned don't match their game counterparts at all. I debated it, but decided to purchase it in the end as its easier to replace two badges down the line than looking for a whole new set.<br /><br />I don't know why it is this way, but it's minor enough that it wouldn't prevent me from buying it as a gift or recommending it. In the end, it is a lovely set that makes me look forward to my other sets arriving in the mail (gotta collect them all)."
4.0,The top part of the dress is a bit see through. My bra shows so I have to use a under cami/ shirt
4.0,The quality is as to be expected for rip off glasses but just from a quick glance you can‚Äôt notice anything. Overall the glasses fool a lot of people. My first pair came without the nose piece and I sent it back and quickly got a replacement.
4.0,I like the room but I wish it had a sturdy bottom.
4.0,"So, I‚Äôve been look it for a cuter band for my Apple Watch, and liked this one! It arrived great, but when I put it together I noticed the buckle is... odd. I tried the strap both ways to make sure I‚Äôm not stupid and even the picture shows it being this way. So I‚Äôm not sure as to what the purpose is here?! Lol. It still works, just looks funky."
4.0,"These are cute little double hoop earrings. They are not meant to be wow statement jewelry, just simple design that you can wear daily with anything. Since all I pretty much wear are small hoops, I ordered these to change it up a little with the split hoop. The size was fine and fit me the same as any other pair of earrings. It came with the metal and plastic back options."
4.0,Buy a 2 sizes up
4.0,"Love the fabric.  Great under a sweatshirt.  As other reviewers stated, the shirt runs small so order a size up."
4.0,"True to size but not for tall girls with long torso, it hurt around the neck because I'm tall so sadly have to return. Really cute though!"
4.0,"I love the style of this gothic keyhole blouse. It features 3/4 bell sleeves, and a peplum waist. The collar is stiff and very uniquely shaped, having a ""wavy"" pattern. It's really stretchy in the center torso area of fabric, allowing for varying bust sizes. (I'm a 40B and wear push up bras.) The mesh part of the shirt has a little stretch to it, but it's kind of scratchy feeling and not very soft in general. I take 1 star off, but I can overlook this because I adore the unique, goth style. The rest of the garment is really comfortable to wear, and overall pretty breathable. If you have bigger arms or shoulders, this might be better if you get a size up. However, if you want the ""cinched waist affect"" I'd get your normal size/or a size down. For reference, I'm 150lbs and 5'10"". I have a long torso and the Large worked awesome. (I wanted the form-fitted, curve hugging look like the photo advertised - I feel like I definitely achieved it with this!) It fits me perfectly. Plus the shirt came in a cool bag with a logo like metal bands. I'd definitely recommend Scarlet Darkness to anyone who loves alternative style clothing."
4.0,"I bought these in navy and found them fit true to size (I'm 2x in workout pants/yoga pants). They are smooth and can be worn under long tunics for an outfit.<br /><br />Note that when they say HIGH RISE, they aren't kidding. I had to pull these up a few times when I wore them as they rolled down, since they reached above my natural waist. I'd say that in wearing them for five hours, I had to reach under my top and yank them up 3 or 4 times.<br /><br />If high rise of this sort bugs you, this will bug you. If you don't mind, you'll do fine. They are thick enough not to be see-through (like some cheap leggings/capris for workout). Except for the waist rolling down, I found these very comfy and snug enough to keep me feeling controlled."
4.0,Very cute top in a great color! Fits as expected and true to size. Would order again.
4.0,My daughters love them.
4.0,Super cute. Looks exactly like picture. Smaller than I anticipated. Does not hold full size wallet.
4.0,I really like the design however the fit is somewhat small.
4.0,"They're a little too blue for me to consider them &#34;black&#34; pearls. Also the pearls I got were a little weirdly formed. But they're comfortable, and I'll still wear them."
4.0,I loved it but.... Noticed it was torn by the sleeve. Pretty dissapointed
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô6 tall and I weight 180 pounds. My problem area is my tummy (after having a kid)<br />1st time I ordered this i followed the size chart they have and it was recommended i get a size XXXL so that‚Äôs what i did because I thought its made in China probably they run small. Nope, turned out very huge like 2 of me can fit in it.<br />I went back and ordered my actual size (L) that‚Äôs what i wear in clothing & besically i am (L) in everything<br />So, ORDER YOUR REGULAR SIZE!"
4.0,i baught this product with the idea that it was a silent alarm clock for heavy sleapers. but its so much more. all i need it for is an alarm clock but if your serous about breaking bad habbits then this is the way to go
4.0,Bought 2 pairs. Wanted pleated slacks hard to find.<br />The material is on the light side more suitable for spring or summer wear. It is wool what quality wool is the question. Not Virgin wool or gaberdine wool. Need to take to a tailor. Will give up date at that time. Overall not bad.
4.0,"This dress is very casual and plain. Too plain for me because I have enough travel ready dresses that are also comfortable with a little more flair. I returned it. Nothing wrong with it, just a little too casual for me."
4.0,"Very lovely scarf. Very soft to your touch. Colors are lively, ready for spring. Can accommodate any occasion. Item is one to introduce to others."
4.0,"This was exactly what we needed, and they lasted just about as long as you'd expect for the price. If you want something durable, you're going to have to bite the bullet and spend a little more. But we just needed something fast and cheap to get him through the last few months of school. They did the job that was required. But then the toes went ragged and his toe poked through. Rowdy boys and their shoes, amiright? Anyway, they were worth the price, but if you're looking for durable or long-wearing, look elsewhere. If you just need a stop-gap answer for fast-growing feet, this is a good buy."
4.0,Love the outfit. But the sweatpants are fit small.
4.0,I love the lace and satin together. It's a little shorter than I thought but it will be good for a wedding or a date night.
4.0,The grip on these gloves is not what I was expecting. I was (still am) looking for a good warm set of gloves that can catch/throw a football and keep your hands warm while officiating a football game.
4.0,"They seem fine, the arms are short as I wanted them down on the bridge of my nose.  Cute patterns"
4.0,Nice hat. Well made. A little tight on my head but hopefully it will stretch a bit.
4.0,It will eventually stretch like another pair I purchased previously. (Carrie)
4.0,"The set was great, though the posts for the earing were very think, almost too thick for my ear holes, but i persevered and spent a few nights getting my ears acclimated to them before having to wear them for a full day. Set was just as expected"
4.0,I really liked these tank tops.  Material was good quality and thick enough but not too thick.  Also love that you get several colors in one pack.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 135 lbs and the mediums fit perfectly.  I like that they are a little longer to layer underneath other clothing too.
4.0,Cute and good quality. I have been basically wearing them 24x7 for about two weeks with no issues. The clasp on one of them occasionally pulls loose and they are a little difficult To align when putting them on so I am deducting a star because of that as I am sure I will eventually lose it. But they are small and unobtrusive and great for continuous wear. No staining and don't bother my sensitive skin.
4.0,I used it a lot so it is running down.
4.0,look good and run small
4.0,"It was beautiful and came in a timely manner.  But it was a little too small, which was my fault"
4.0,"Love this suit!! BUT ORDER A 1-1.5 SIZES UP!! (I'm almost a large, and bigger chested, and I got an XL) 145 lbs, 5'4&#34;<br />I got so many compliments on it! Might order another in a different color :) Good buy!"
4.0,They are nice shorts . Not as long as husband wanted but they are nice quality
4.0,"Don't wear everyday , it has stay nice and shinny so far"
4.0,"A little on the heavy side, thick but still I'm happy with the value. Nice mechanical Swiss watch!"
4.0,"Wonderful fit and it's knit so I'd probably wear it around as a kind of relaxing dress -- if you want to wear it outside, I'd recommend wearing a belt or corset, since that would help the shape."
4.0,This bra is comfortable but smaller than expected.
4.0,"There fit perfect, they are soft, I don‚Äôt have back pain..for been on my feet all day, this are the best shoes I ever bought....they look good and give me a extra inch tall I love themüòÄ"
4.0,"Fits well, the only fault is that the dress has a very strong factory like smell. After washing it and soaking it, the smell dissipated. So I would still recommend it gor the price but be sure to wash it first"
4.0,Disappointed.<br />Didn‚Äôt come with a charm
4.0,"Allons-y! We're a huge Whovian family! I thought it would be Fantastic to get this Fez hat and gender-bend the 11th Doctor. However, it doesn't fit my head, it's way too large. My 3-year-old had fun wearing it and playing with the 10th Doctor's sonic screwdriver, but again, way too big. It does fit my husband's large head quite nicely. He said it was comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The material is wool, but it doesn't make your head too hot while wearing it. It has nice touches, but it's just way too large for most people. Even the height of it is a bit large.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a nice Fez hat for some photobooths or just to play with, but if you're trying to cosplay the 11th Doctor I would look for a different Fez. Geronimo!<br /><br />During a promotional period I received this Fez Hat in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"I just didn‚Äôt like the coloring, thought it would be more tan/brown but it was grey."
4.0,Decent quality didn‚Äôt really like the hat but the rest of it was ok
4.0,A little large and stretches extremely easily.
4.0,"Product is very reasonably priced, this makes a great gift for teachers, therapists, family, friends, and childcare providers!"
4.0,"This was a very nice dress, but i bought it for my baby shower and it was too tight for my belly.  That being said, if i wasn't pregnant it would have fit very well.<br /><br />The cut was fairly modest for a vneck wrap and i would have felt comfortable with the neckline.  The dress was a little short for me but I am 5'10 so that's not too surprising."
4.0,"I'm a 12 but I always buy a size up with Asian clothing. This dress was a little too large on me. The waist actually a curved hem and hit in the middle of my hips. It should have been higher to create a more flattering look. Also, I don't have a large chest and this dress was too roomy. The neckline is crew and basically like a choker around the neck. Best for someone looking for a very conservative dress but not for me. Good quality fabric and sewing."
4.0,I like this coat.  I am a bigger girl and based on the sizing chart I ordered the 3X.  It was VERY big and I had to send it back for a smaller size.  I am waiting for that one to come but I was happy with the quality of the coat.  It looked very nice and had nice details.
4.0,Seems like as advertised.  I just recently received them but they fit fine - seem comfortable - time will tell - but so far i am pleased.
4.0,"I'm quite happy with the dresses I purchased with the exception of them being too long. I'm 5'2"" and the dresses were made for a much taller woman. I had to cut about 4 inches off and still they are too long but they are acurate with size.  I purchased about 6 dresses in the summer of 2018 and can hardly wait to wear them again this summer and I received many, many compliments."
4.0,liked alot
4.0,These were really nice and solid high quality
4.0,lov it but the globe fell of ...u can fix it but it keeps falling ...so not very impressed
4.0,"The socks are cute and they fit well. I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll do in the long run yet since I just got them. The only downside I had was that they didn‚Äôt have what I wanted which was all yellow for a costume. They sent me an assorted mount of color and were kind enough to throw in some extra socks for the trouble, so for that they were great, the only thing was that they didn‚Äôt notify me before shipping that they didn‚Äôt have what I want. For that I took off one star. Over all though they are nice socks."
4.0,I was replacing a spring loaded hook on a key pouch that kept gettin caught on my pants. This carabiner has worked great. I highly recommend it.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but the color in the picture was not the color of the shirt
4.0,"These are very cute in person. I didn't realize the fabric was kind of silky. They were much too big for my daughter so we returned them. I do have concerns about how they would have held up if we would have kept them though, she is rough on her shoes."
4.0,Exactly what I wanted for a slip on shoe for casual wear.
4.0,"I love my shirt. It came pretty fast. I need to order some more because I want to wear it everyday lol. When I washed it, it didn't fade (and I washed it 6 times already)."
4.0,"Very nice piece, as described but it was delivered with one leg missing. I fixed it myself so I did not have to send it back for a replacement."
4.0,"Honestly pretty happy with this jacket. The fit, the hang, the weight are all just what I wanted.<br />My only complaints are<br />1) the zipper is on the other side, and<br />2) the patches are a little over-the-top military<br /><br />I still need to decide if I'm going to remove some of the patches or if it's not a big deal, but right now I feel like I might get mistaken for impersonating a service member."
4.0,The top fits perfectly but the bottom runs a bit small
4.0,Super cute. Material is thin. Fits great
4.0,"The material feels a little strange, but it fits nicely (snug) and has a good stretch to it. I love that there are no tags inside the garment."
4.0,"Fit great on my iwatch, love the design. Also good material, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a iwatch"
4.0,I thought I ordered a 24 month but got a 3T so my nephew will have to grow into it. Good quality outfit for the price tho. Came sooner than expected.
4.0,A little thin but a cute dress.
4.0,Looks great but the print is starting to fade after 3 weeks after constant wear. KTBFFH
4.0,Fits great. They do ride down in the back though. I'll wear a long shirt with them for sure.
4.0,"It is a lightweight jacket, I did need to layer with long sleeve warm shirts for 36 degrees with a puffy vest too for a walk. So I have no doubt that this jacket would be okay 50 degrees and above. I am 5'4 130lb and I ordered a Medium. Fit me great, made well."
4.0,Fabric seems a little bit not as high quality as in past years but it's ok.
4.0,"I own a lot of rings. I know my exact size.  The lower shank is quite fat which makes it difficult to fit on/off.  In addition, the head is very wide.  This adds up to a tight fit over the knuckle.  You essentially lose a full size.  Notice I‚Äôm not saying it runs small, it FITS small over the knuckle, very difficult to get on/off.  The problem is that you can‚Äôt just buy a whole size larger or the ring will be loose once it‚Äôs on.  Have some soap nearby."
4.0,"If your a big girl 1x and up this does run small. I'm a 1x I could get it on, but after a hour I could barely breathe lol so get a bigger size if possible.... Great for compression tho, just too tight for me."
4.0,"The material feels a bit off, but it‚Äôs not bad, it fits slightly smaller than I expected but it wasn‚Äôt horrible, design wise it was what I was expecting."
4.0,"It is a perfect layering item to mix with a thin shirt. It is colorful and holds up well with multiple washings. it is thin, like a t-shirt material, and the arms and length are all great."
4.0,Good for online purchase
4.0,"Grandkids love them so far , only had a couple chances to use them. Great suction and comfort. Will check back when we get more uses to let you know about value üëçüèª"
4.0,"I love the shirt, but I feel it runs small. According to the model, it looks roomy. I wear med. and larges in shirts, and ordered a large in this brand, but  feels in runs like a medium."
4.0,"Good for the money, but hit the bridge of my nose and was a little uncomfortable."
4.0,"Ordered the teal dress. Fits nice. It‚Äôs extremely adjustable with the tie around the waist. So if you want it tighter, you can just tighten the ties around your waist. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 130 lbs and ordered a medium. It hit slightly lower than mid thigh and fit nice. I typically order small but went medium. Wore it for a spring wedding."
4.0,Love these bands<br />But it is showing signs of Ware and they started after a few weeks
4.0,"I really love the material of these leggings. I personally don‚Äôt use them for workouts although they could easily be used for that. However, I bought mine for a more athleisure wear for my recent Colorado trip. They‚Äôre great because they‚Äôre a thicker material so it did a great job at keeping me decently warm. They are not see-through at all and are buttery soft.<br />For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3.5‚Äù 160lbs.<br />For more Amazon finds follow me on IG and on LIKEtoKNOW.it app! @elythearies"
4.0,"The pendant is lovely although a little thin for the price. It could be just a tad weightier. Also, don't rely on the ring they provide for attachment. I lost the first one I purchased and the second one I replaced it with fell off my bracelet. Fortunately I found the charm this time."
4.0,Great colors and fit1
4.0,"This jacket will work for its intended purpose as my cosplay and for taking pictures, but I was a little disappointed when I tried it on and the sleeves around the top of my arms and shoulders were very tight and I can barely lift my arms up. Other than that the sleeves fit perfectly down to my wrists and the crop is in the right spot on my waist. I just have thick upper arms I guess. Probably won't be comfortable wearing it all day at the con."
4.0,The shirt is cute but it is more of a pajama quality/material. It‚Äôs not something I would wear out with jeans as pictured.
4.0,Read the description before you buy. My only complaint is that I thought this was an actual windbreaker but my outfit came in a cotton fabric and the pants were a bit short. I still liked it though. I did order a size up as a just in case and that worked perfectly.
4.0,"I was looking for a one and done dress for a formal event in February.  I loved this dress and I wanted to keep it, BUT I couldn‚Äôt get the right size. I am a US size 12, so I ordered a size up to a 14. The zipper kept getting hung and wouldn‚Äôt go all the way up. The website didn‚Äôt have another 14, so I went up a size to a 16. The top was too big. The built in bra wasn‚Äôt attached as nicely as the 14. Another negative was the small beading on the top kept falling off. This happened in both dresses. It‚Äôs like the beads were glued on. I still have these little beads on my bedroom floor sticking to my bare feet. Lol. It is a beautiful dress, but just didn‚Äôt workout for me."
4.0,"These are cozy but I would have preferred them to be a bit looser. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and about 140 lbs. usually I wear a Medium but I bought a Large after reading reviews. So glad I did because these fit perfectly, but I actually wish they were a bit looser since I mainly bought these to throw on over my swim suit after my daughter‚Äôs swim lessons.  I should have ordered a XL."
4.0,Nice rob. ran very large
4.0,Nice bathing suit. It is comfortable and flattering. Order a size up. Has a unique top strap. Modest and supportive.
4.0,"This jacket isn‚Äôt too bad quality, but you get what you pay for! (: it‚Äôs good if you don‚Äôt wanna spend too much on your Yoru cosplay"
4.0,Love this so much! I wear it under my dresses and it makes me feel so much skinner. The only down side it the metal bars on the side poke out when I sit. It's not noticeable to others but I notice. I'm a large girl. I'm 175 and wear a large to medium usually. I got a 3xl because of what the measurments said.
4.0,"It  is very stylish, simple, with a modern city look. It is roomy, but not too big. The bag is well made and high quality. The color (silver) is beautiful and flawless.I am quite happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Bought it for my fianc√© which loved it, the quality is excellent and comfortable to wear EXCEPT the color is not accurate. Ordered a ‚Äúgold‚Äù color and when it arrived it‚Äôs actually a rose gold which my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt loving lol and I don‚Äôt wear an Apple Watch so it‚Äôs a bummer! Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,"I once streched my ears to a 12g then relized i didnt like them. I ordered these thinking that the would be better. Well they were. Shipping took too long for a pair of earings, and they have less of a marble effect then displayed but that might just be my pair. If your ear is a normal size, full ear lobe then these arent to big. However they sell them from 4g - 00g. I am well pleased over all with the quality and looks. Cant wait to wear them out!"
4.0,"I purchased this watch and the matching mens watch for my mother and father in law for Mothers and Fathers days, respectively.  They really liked them and the watches are much better in person as the pictures don't show you how the light hits them and highlights the wood.  I had to knock a star off of the women's watch, however, as it was way too small for my mother in law.  The mens watch was way too big for my father in law so they switched watches.  Whatever works for them, but that does tell me that it is important on these watches to measure your wrist to make sure it will fit.  Links are removable but no extra links are included.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.  The watch runs well, has a quiet tick and looks incredibly expensive.  The boyfriend watch look is in right now so if you are a lady don't stress about the size of the womens watch if you have big wrists.  Go for the mens.  If you are a man and have little wrists, go for the ladies.  They are both nice.<br /><br />I purchased this wooden watch at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them. I am not a paid reviewer and I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. I gain nothing by giving this item a positve, negative or neutral review. If at any time in the future with prolonged use of any product my opinion changes, I will leave an update to my review of the product (as you can see by past reviews, that happens)."
4.0,Super cute... Perfect spring sweater top.
4.0,"Cool, reversible! Keeps my head warm! Would recommend."
4.0,Gave to my mom who is a med/lrg ordered a 3x it was fitting like a glove on her!  Runs extremely small.  Mom is 5‚Äô8 150lbs 3x was too small.
4.0,These are nice and cool.  They fit well and look cute.  They only problem is that the shorts ride up pretty bad.  So you end up reaching under the skirt to pull down the shorts.
4.0,"I really like this dress. As others have mentioned, the fabric is nice & thick, making it great as fall & winter set in. I was more than slightly confused by the mixed messages arising from 2 different sets of washing directions, but after looking at reviews, I decided to machine wash it on the delicate cycle & let it air dry. It seems to have done well. I washed it with liquid fabric softener prior to wearing to remove the sizing and soften the skirt. It worked great!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the high waist is a bit too high for me. I wish the top was about 2 inches longer. It nicely hides my stomach though."
4.0,Fit good looked even better
4.0,I love this shirt's it is flattering and nice it did run a little shorter than I wanted. 5'4 200 lbs
4.0,This is the perfect cute little purse for my Cuba trip
4.0,"Besides the mini dicks on one of the bags, they are nice!"
4.0,"It's a bit snug in the top area so it would probably last me a couple years.<br /><br />Other than that, the fabric is feels nice :)"
4.0,"The item arrived sooner than expected which was great. Unfortunately, I didn't look good in it at all, but considering how the style of the dress is, I'm not surprised that it isn't for everyone. Really, it is more of a ""me"" issue. However, it did fit very well, and the color was great. Worth the try!"
4.0,"i really like the look of these earring cuffs, but i wish that they were a little more curved towards the top, in a more backward angle. as these some, they sit on my ear on the bottom and they stick out on the top  and are not very flattering when they stick out. i had my husband bend them back a little and they fit better and look better. I think some sort of top of the cuff area needs some way to secure to the ear. Secondly, the post for the pierced part is REALLY long. its way too long for me. I have to push the back stopper all the way up to my ear in the back, because of the weight of the earrings, and there is a LOT of post that pokes me in the head.<br />Otherwise, these are cute. I would wear them out on a date night."
4.0,Wife really likes them. She has gotten 3 pairs of them
4.0,This cute belly button ring has held up pretty well. Looks just like the picture.
4.0,"My daughter wore these for 4-5 hours at a wedding we bought these for her to wear to, before she even complained of the slightest soreness.  Then she wore them for her Wonder Woman costume for Halloween all day at school. I'd definitely purchase these again. The only problem is that the zipper is a little hard to zip up."
4.0,The shoe fits perfectly an arrive an time.
4.0,"Had to send first one back because I couldn't open, no instructions. Second one figured it out is fine."
4.0,"The glasses feel and look great on, only problem is the picture looks like camouflage but the ones I received are a solid uniform color"
4.0,"For the price these are great shoes. My son is growing fast, so we will likely purchase another pair in a different size soon."
4.0,"After reading everyone‚Äôs review, I ordered one size smaller than I needed. It fit nicely, so size does run big. Nice light fabric."
4.0,Order one size smaller. The material is slightly thin
4.0,Fit is great. I like the patterns. Quality is as expected given the price but that doesn't mean that it's poor quality.
4.0,Product exactly as pictured. Quick delivery. Unfortunately one pearl had fallen out and it wasn‚Äôt in the package for me to fix it. Hence the 4 star rating.
4.0,My wife loves it for making her morning shakes.
4.0,My 10 year old daughter was so excited when they came in. She thought they looked cool and loved the fur inside. She was very disappointed when we had to return them because they were too big.
4.0,"Good for my 4 year old a little big nit much tho, good quality"
4.0,It does not come with the belt in the picture but it's a good dress. Only thing that is weird is that the neck line is not tight around your neck like you'd expect. It kind of flares out and hits closer to the start of the shoulder.
4.0,"although it was a little snug, i still loved the style and gave it to my daughter."
4.0,"I'll update this review when I get it.  I noticed that the long sleeved tops are the ones with the problems with fitting.  Looks large, longer and baggy sleeves.<br />I see, so I planned on cutting the sleeves off and taking it in.  I'm tall, so this will not be a dress on me 5'10&#34;<br />Very cute lace trim.  I liked the trim that went all the way around.<br />I may do a half moon dart under the breast area which will give any top a sexy look and I do this with most the blouses, t-shirts and tops.  Try the half moon dart if you see, you'll be putting in in every I'll fitting shirt, blouse,  etc...  HOT LOOK!!!"
4.0,This dress is beautiful but pretty long. I am 5‚Äô3 160lbs and ordered a large.
4.0,"I very much appreciate that this belt cinches tightly.  I have never owned a belt that fits as snug as this does.  I love that.  Initially, I was unhappy with this product because I was having a difficult time unfastening the latch to loosen the belt, with the latch on the bottom of the buckle.  But I found that if I put the belt on the opposite way, threading the belt in from left to right, the latch is on top of the buckle, and I have a much easier time unfastening the latch.  It's a bit awkward at first, but at least it enables me to use the belt successfully. I am now happy with the product."
4.0,Well made. I wish they were a little darker.
4.0,I love these shades! They are indeed showstoppers!
4.0,"This is a pretty dress, just not the best. I ordered the blue and it seems to be slightly brighter than the pictures online, not quite as dark (I was hoping for more of a darker navy color). I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 110 lbs and 32A chest, I ordered the small and it was absolutely huge on me. I took several inches in on each side and now it fits a little better but still slightly loose. I did get a lot of complements on it when I did wear it so everyone else seems to like it."
4.0,"Great color, full as expected, i just wish it was longer"
4.0,"Super cute! Material is light, and the shirt fits well."
4.0,"I have a big head. So it was a surprise when this was a little bit too big for me. Not really a problem, I can just tighten the velcro, but if you have a tin head this hat might not be for you.<br /><br />But I love the distressing and the color, perfect for a bad hair day and to edge up your look a little bit. These dad hats are super in right now, so instead of dropping 30 bucks on the same thing from Urban Outfitters, get this.<br /><br />Super cute, kinda big, would recommend."
4.0,Grta quality but it fits somewhat big
4.0,There needs to be more room in the rear. Some of us girls have a bit more &#34;junk in the trunk&#34;.
4.0,I love this top. The color is the same as the picture and fits true to size.
4.0,"Very nice set of earrings, my wife loved it and wear it all the time. Good product, highly recommended,"
4.0,"It's a little big, I have to twist it around my wrist one more time to make it fit."
4.0,"Looks really great, alone or mixed and matched with a fun top.  I'd say its a little hard to adjust but I got lost of compliments so definitely a winning purchase"
4.0,Great uniform shoes for my 7 year old!  Comfortable and durable.  She has been wearing them full time for 3 months and they are in great shape!
4.0,very nice! Soft and comfortable. I will only order leggings from Leggings Depot!
4.0,"These hats are very nice, especially for the price.  Other reviews complain about them having no shape, but they are clearly marketed as unstructured hats so that's what you get.  My complaint is this posting doesn't mention size and suggests these are one size fits all.  The hats on this posting are actually S/M, which didn't work well for me.  The company does have another posting with M/L hats, but it wasn't obvious how to find it."
4.0,"I wore this for eight hours for three days. My nose was bruised at the end, but for me it was worth it to have some protection as an incredibly crowded event."
4.0,"I have trouble finding sunglasses that fit me because I have a big head. I wear size 7 7/8 in New Era Baseball caps to give you an idea of how big my head is. These glasses are awesome. They fit perfectly and look very cool. They look like they cost more than they do. Great value. They come with a nice carrier as well.<br />  The one thing that prevented me from giving them a 5 star rating is that one of the arms came off after a few months. I tend to be pretty hard on my sunglasses, I wear them every day and they usually get thrown in my backpack pouch so I admit that if I had been more careful  they may have lasted longer. But no matter they are cheap enough to just buy another pair, which I did!"
4.0,"I got this for my eleven year old son for a Michigan football game and he loved it. He said it had an ""old school look"". Apparently that ""old school look"" is cool because he wears it all the time."
4.0,Beautifully made but should be a little larger to accommodate girls with long hair.
4.0,You should probably order a size down if considering this shirt. It fits extremely big!!!
4.0,Fairly nice bags. Not heavyweight material<br />but not too light. Zippers seem pretty solid and the size is pretty close the description. Using them to organize bug-out bags and EDC pack.
4.0,"The camo sweatshirt is not as nice as the other sweatshirt I had bought, which was red. I believe this is because the camo design is most likely ironed on or something, so it makes the sweatshirt a little stiffer than my other one. I would recommend just buying a flat color sweatshirt rather than one with a design, like this one. Besides that the sweatshirt is a little stiff, it's the perfect size. I'm 5 foot and around 100 pounds and a small fit snug with a little extra room. As I said in a different review, if I knew it would be this &#34;perfect&#34; I would have ordered a medium. The thickness of the sweatshirt is also not as thick as a normal sweatshirt, but it's not think enough to be a normal t-shirt, which is a nice middle ground, and is also pretty warm. Besides that, the alien patch was a little sloppily sewn on and you can see some messed up stitches. It's not too big of a problem because they're not really messing up the face, just the outline, but it'd be nice if there was no problem at all."
4.0,"This is a cute ballet flat. The color is called navy, but I would call it navy denim as the outer fabric is dark blue denim. These shoes have a little inside padding which is nice. The width of these shoes is wider than average which is great for me, as I sometimes buy a wide shoe. I wear a size 9 to 9.5. In these in need a 9.5 for my toes to have enough room to be comfortable."
4.0,Good show but the bottoms are very slippery.
4.0,"I got this for my husband as a birthday present in an XL, and it's a tight fit on him. Looks like we're going to need to air dry this to keep it from shrinking!"
4.0,"The neck was a mock turtle neck, which I had altered; now all is well. Nice loose fit. Sleeve length works. Not a summer dress but will for Spring and Fall."
4.0,Nice but I wish there are other bracelet that are the same size to wear as a dual set.
4.0,Nice. A bit pricey for what u can get out there
4.0,"This is the cutest little outfit. The quantity is a little low on the shirt. But the shorts are great! Runs very large, my baby is 15 lbs and the 6-9 month is huge on him. Looks more like a 12 month size, so order a size down."
4.0,"Bought for a 5'1'' tall female. These socks do not reach knee height but rather just below the knee. We expected this to extend above the knee like shown in the picture or even higher. That is not the case, but they appear well made and are comfortable."
4.0,VERY Large but still love it.
4.0,"Nice but thin and not very long, but it‚Äôll do. Us more thicker girls need a little more length, but overall a nice and comfy top. It also rolls up for the full figure girls that don‚Äôt have flat abs."
4.0,Plenty of room in the sleeves but I have a belly so it was snug there. Really nice and cute though
4.0,Fashion.
4.0,The quality of the hoodie is great. The sizing fits just right. The only issue I have is that the hood is somewhat some.
4.0,Cute and comfy but super long
4.0,Thin China material but still cute n fit well
4.0,Looks long in pic but it‚Äôs not.  Great elastic waist with fake tie belt. Prt is great and can dress up or down. Purchased L
4.0,I‚Äôve tried 3 other kinds before this. I have pregnancy varicose veins and need the extra support for them and these seem to do the trick. The inside of these socks on the foot is incredibly soft However they are on the thicker side so that will make certain shoes tough.<br />Update: these became my go to for my especially painful days because the tightness was much tighter than other brands I purchased. They are VERY hard to put on especially while pregnant . They also tend to collect hair on the bottom and it gets stuck so I had to ‚Äúshave it‚Äù off.
4.0,only wore them once since bday but they were a good fit!
4.0,Pretty but cheAp material
4.0,"This is sooooo pretty!!! I expected white though. It is cream - not even close to white. Light chiffon like material - gorgeous colors, but if you are wanting white - it is not!!"
4.0,Fits well doesn‚Äôt slip.  Breathable.
4.0,"i like it and most of all my husband does.  Well made, well worth it"
4.0,"Although the dress didn‚Äôt work out for me personally, the seller was super responsive and refunded me after I sent back the dress & tracking #. Wonderful customer service!"
4.0,Nice cap.  Just wish brim was slightly smaller.
4.0,"I was expecting it to have a lot more room. I have 4 cards in it and it can get a little tight making it hard to pull out the card when I need it. I think i got a used one as well, a little scratched up but it adds some character. We'll see how well it holds within the next few days!"
4.0,"Bought these for a older client, they were easy to put on and easy to use.<br />they also have a quick release that makes it easy to get them on and off.<br />I would buy them again."
4.0,"Perfect fit, only gripe about it is how thin the material is. It's not see through but I wish it was a smidge thicker."
4.0,"These are comfortable and what I was looking for. However, I wanted to share that I am a 36C, and I got the S-L size, thinking I‚Äôd be closer to a large. These are really a lot roomier than I thought they‚Äôd be."
4.0,My son likes these slippers for wearing around the house - he says they keep his feet toasty.  :)
4.0,Se ve genial
4.0,updated- initially I was not happy with my purchase. i was offered a replacement. Good customer care. thanks!
4.0,Really comfortable and looks good. Wish it came in smaller sizes.
4.0,"Runs small and not the highest quality material but amazing for the price.  The zipper is really cheap and I'm sure that will be what goes first, but it is perfect for a pop of floral and is a nice weight as a layering piece - very thin, would not be used as an actual jacket to keep warm.  Took the full shipping time to receive, don't expect it quickly!"
4.0,I love this shirt. I just wish you guys would make it in black as well.
4.0,I‚Äôll give it 4 starts because i think they are a little bit expensive for a kids sunglasses but I like that they are more resistant than other brands. Really cute color.
4.0,Love to color and material
4.0,Neat clean
4.0,These are extremely comfortable and fit me very well. However... I‚Äôm not sure they are one size fits all. I found them a bit small to fit everyone compared to other one size fits all leggings that seem to be much larger on me than these are. I can also see my skin when I bend my knee.
4.0,I wish I would have ordered the next size up. The arms are a little tight. Good incentive to lose 5lbs!<br />The dress is made well. I would definitely wear it to church. It would be cute with boots in the fall or sandals in the summer.
4.0,Look pretty!
4.0,"Great fabric, but came a little tight."
4.0,"I like the hat, but the band keeps getting unhooked from the plastic hook."
4.0,"The hat was nice, somewhat small, if u have a lot of hair it will sit on the top of your head"
4.0,"Comfortable socks, pretty stylish.  Could see them wearing out though fast, pretty thin."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little larger than I expected but I didn‚Äôt mind because since they‚Äôre to sleep in, they‚Äôre actually very comfortable"
4.0,"I will give this item 4 stars.  The quality isn't as high end as what you would purchase at a studio, BUT the cost is a pretty good value for what you receive.  I haven't noticed any major shrinkage in the wash.  I do notice there is space at the end of the toes and that the toe length are all basically the same.  Perhaps they are made for folks with finger toes. *shrugs*  In any case, I would probably purchase these again or recommend to a friend who is more concerned with price than with whether the toes fit completely."
4.0,I do like
4.0,These fit nicely and I am pleased that they are easier to put on than I anticipated.
4.0,I ordered an XL but this was a tad too big but I can definitely make it work. You can't really tell. Excited to wear this to a wedding next weekend.
4.0,"I sized up to a M for a loose fit but it still didn‚Äôt achieve that look. I probably should‚Äôve ordered L. Other than that, material is great and the back is cute with a strappy sport bra."
4.0,"I got this because I'm a huge sword art online fan. it looks just like the one in the anime, and is honestly very pretty. I personally didn't like the chain, but it was a quality one, and disliking the look of it was just my opinion. it wasn't a problem, though, because switching it to a different chain was no big deal. as for the pendant, it's gorgeous, but plastic. it doesn't look it though, and I received many compliments on it. I'm very satisfied with this purchase"
4.0,When I had these I was rough on them and they held up perfect. The material was very durable and wasn't uncomfortable when water got under it.
4.0,The material was thinner than I liked but I still like the shirt.
4.0,These are great earrings. They are really light. I've gotten so many compliments on them. I only knocked off one star because they're a bit difficult to get on. Otherwise...love them!
4.0,"Very cute necklace.  Chain seems to be a bit light for the pendant, but otherwise love it!"
4.0,"This gives a nice, professional look to my Fitbit Luxe, making it a polished addition to my everyday wear to work jewelry / accessories. Didn't have to adjust it, it was the right size to begin with!"
4.0,I noticed that after a few washes the stitching at the &#34;V&#34; neck started to come apart.  No big deal.
4.0,Nice quality material but runs very large my 19mnth old was swimming in the 18mnth size. My daughter weighs 23lb. Size 12month probably would have been a better fit. In Carters onsies my daughter wears a size 18mnth to 24mnth.
4.0,I would have given this vest 5 stars except that it doesn't have a loop at the collar to hang on the peg in my mud room. It's weight is perfect for cool rainy weather but no collar loop no 5 star.
4.0,The product looks really nice
4.0,Very good quality but runs very small
4.0,There is no softness on the inside. It should have a light fleece to make it more comfortable.
4.0,"Green paradise printed holiday maxi dress. Wonderful fit, feels and looks great. Love it!"
4.0,"I love this set but it's probably best not to wash or wear too much. I wear it occasionally and only wash it when I need to and it has held up very nice with a few straggly threads starting to appear. It still looks amazing though!<br />I am 5'1"" and 130 pounds and it is a bit tight on me, but I love how it looks (: It is super flattering and I really like the tight and short look. If you want something less fitting, try a size up!"
4.0,Great dress for a great price! Very comfortable!
4.0,I really like this top I bought it for my trip to Cancun. I‚Äôm normally a medium but I ordered a large because I didn‚Äôt want it to fit like a crop top. I have big boobs and the girls fit nicely with out them being to expose. It does have a wire in the front that did come threw with the first wash.
4.0,The charm is quite small but its a nice anklet for the price.
4.0,Nice shades for the price
4.0,"Nice and roomy but with a couple of pockets as well, what I ordered"
4.0,"Super cute crop. Fit fairly well but a little shorter than I expected.  If you‚Äôre wearing this with a sports bra it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. If you‚Äôre bigger chested, like C/D or higher, esp if u want to wear with a normal bra, size up."
4.0,"The one piece swimsuit is stretchy made of 18% Spandex + 82% Nylon, it has a shelf bra soft molded cups with underwire provides moderate coverage. Classic style like back in the 50's/60's. The polka dot is designed to make the tummy slimmer and accentuates the bust. It features adjustable halter tie and boyleg provides more coverage makes movement more comfortable. I ordered size XL which i usually get, it fits me except the bust area. If you wear size 38D or larger i recommend ordering 2 sizes up. I wear size large blouse and size 12 dress. Sample received at discount or no cost for an honest opinion. I'm not affiliated with the product and company. I received no compensation for my review."
4.0,"I just got these and immediately put them on, and I already love them! I'll have to see how they are in the gym and how they feel as they rotate. I would give 5 starts exact that I JUST got them. I'll update later."
4.0,Cute and soft but definitely runs big. I ordered an XS and it fits like a medium.
4.0,Satisfied with material/color & size. Just like picture.
4.0,I wanted a blue watchband and this watch band is gray.  The photo gives a false impression with the original ad.  Do not order this watchband. if you want blue!!!  Edit:  I just went to the site and they now state that the watchband is gray and the photo is more true to color.  It is actually a faded gray.  Otherwise it is very pretty and I can upgrade my rating.  I did want blue and hoped that this had been as originally advertised.  At least it is true to color and the gray is pretty.
4.0,I ordered 24 months for my son and it was to big. Not so much that he can't wear it but it sags alot in the diaper area because of how large it was. Other than the sizing issue I like it. The fabric is comfy and the words are clear. Might get a size smaller next time.but hey at least he can grow into it.
4.0,"For a light summer dress, this is nice, but you definitely need to wear a slip. But overall I like the dress, it fits just fine."
4.0,Lots to choose from
4.0,I love it! So cute.
4.0,Thinner material than I had expected.
4.0,"This particular model was not quite the width I prefer, but Bayite has others that I found later that fit  my requirements. Excellent fit and finish, easy to size, well worth the money. I kept it."
4.0,"I glad I ordered these earrings. They look good on, feel good, and are easy to maintain. I'm very pleased."
4.0,"Finally a bonnet that really fits the way I want it to fit.  Full coverage of my head, comfortable and doesn‚Äôt slip off my head while I‚Äôm sleeping."
4.0,"Great shirt. I'm contemplating buying another color. It fits a little tighter in the shoulders so definitely had to size up, but still love it."
4.0,Fit was a bit smaller but very comfortable and nice quality fabric
4.0,The item is ok but not worth the wait. took a long time to get. over 3 weeks
4.0,"I'm 5'1 and 165 pounds. I ordered an XL You can see how the dress fits in the picture. I kinda wish i had ordered a large instead so it would be a bit more form fitting, but I think it'll shrink when I wash and dry it, so it's all good. I took a star off only because originally, a picture showed it as being a 3/4 sleeve, and it's actually a full sleeve. That aside, i'm  very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"Purchased for a family member and she loved them, plain n simple."
4.0,"The earrings are very cute, but they all arrived with the posts on the back bent. I was easily able to bend the posts back straight, but I'm afraid they might break off at some point since the metal has been compromised and make weaker now."
4.0,"This is a cute, reasonably sized, stylish envelope purse, but I needed a grey purse with SILVER hardware.  Though it looked like the grey had silver hardware in the photo, mine came with gold.  Returning!"
4.0,I love this and wear it all the time! comfortable and you can wear it a couple of different ways. I also bought it because my daughters high school colors are green and white and I wear it to her volleyball games! Hats are coming back!!
4.0,These seem to be a bit short at the rear waist.  Which makes my daughter tug them up a fair amount.  They otherwise fit well though they are long.<br /><br />The fabric is thin - they're really more summer pjs than winter though my daughter decided to keep them on after trying them.
4.0,Just a bit thinner fabric than I intended.
4.0,Great shirt! Exactly what I was looking for and size and length were great!
4.0,Really good looking dress with quality fabric!
4.0,Great show fits well
4.0,"Cute shirt, mybhusband ordered a size 6 and looks like it fits my petite daughter perfectly and she's just about to turn 6."
4.0,nice material not as big as thought would be will be nice to wear under a shirt for extra protection
4.0,"These rompers are light-weight and cool for hot summer days. We live in Texas, so that's important. I've gotten several items from the SillyApples brand. The items don't seem top quality, but good enough considering how fast babies grow out of their clothes. One thing that surprised me about the dinosaur print one is the dinosaurs are kind of like rubberized heat transfer decals on the fabric rather than printed with ink on the cloth, so it's definitely possible that may start to flake off with repeated washings."
4.0,"This is a really fun hat. It work good as a smaller hat, but when I button on the brim, it is huge! Keeping it, as it keep the sun off my head even without the extended brim."
4.0,"Love my birthday outfit!!!! Lots of compliments! I order a xl. Skirt fit perfectly, shirt was a little big but do-able for my taste. Material soft,  easy wash but will run color so wash with dark clothes."
4.0,I love this dress for everyday wear! It's so comfortable! This is not a figure hugging dress! :-) It's free flowing! My only suggestion is to make the bust a little bit bigger on the large. I do love that I can wear this without a bra! ;-) Please make more so I can but a couple more of these!
4.0,Really comfortable and fit as it should. I'm 5'5 and I got the medium
4.0,The bracelet was nice
4.0,It‚Äôs gorgeous butnorder a size up definitely
4.0,order a size larger for a perfect fit
4.0,"even though the jacket is thin, it still looks cute on. Im 5'6 inches tall and weigh 145 pounds and I ordered a XL and it fit perfect with room to wear  a thin sweater or shirt under it"
4.0,Got here on time i love them! The fabric is a stretch material and my size changed so i read the reviews and what the size should be for it and they fit! they are so comfy! the only thing is they made the pockets really really big so they look excessive but i normally just stick my hands in the pocket and chooose what lookss best
4.0,This is really a great made shirt. My issue is that I was reading reviews saying it fit small and ordered a large. I have to send it back and am ordering a medium. The color is great also.
4.0,"I read all the reviews about sizing, etc, definitely ordered the best size for my body. Unfortunately, these sweaters are just made to be big. I‚Äôm assuming the models in all the photos are holding extra fabric behind their back to make it appear fitted, because it is not. There is also no hem/waistband part to the bottom of the sweater, which is primarily the cause for all the bagginess.<br /><br />Pros: The fabric was really soft and seemed warm1"
4.0,"Me encant√≥ el tama√±o, lo simple y la belleza de los aretes. La verdad muy bien dise√±ados adem√°s de el precio muy asequible para obtener 4 pares de aretes."
4.0,"The print is a faded, the fabric and cut is great. runs a little small"
4.0,My wife liked the pants but she has  gained a little weight so she gave them to my sister. She loves them. She would recommend them to other people just be careful if you are in the process of gaining weight.
4.0,"Pros:<br />-love the black on black<br />-don't irritate my ears<br />Cons:<br />-backing can get loose<br />Good to Know:<br />-I ordered the 5mm size<br /><br />I really like these earrings. I was looking for something that was a black stone without silver metal, because any metal that silver irritates my ears. I'm really happy to after over a week of wearing these the black metal ‚Äì I believe it's surgical steel ‚Äì that they are made with has not irritated my ears‚Ä¶ Before this the only metal I found that I could use was 14 karat gold. I really like how clean and plain the black stones look. I ordered the 5 mm size, I think I'm probably going to order the 3 mm to have also because I was looking for something a little more low-profile then these. I've already had several compliments on these earrings and I love that I can wear them with just about any outfit that I have. The only negative that I have found these earrings is that the back portion does get loose during the day. The stump portion of the earrings does have a notch on it so the backing shouldn't come all the way off but I still like to tighten them throughout the day because I get paranoid that they are going to fall out.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I don't  give good reviews just because I received an hour a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!"
4.0,It makes you sweat and is worth the money. The durability is great. You wont be disappointed.
4.0,"The shirt is nice but it's a little shorter than what I like, what makes it hard to wear. The material is great and it washes and dries perfectly."
4.0,Don‚Äôt feel any different but looks cool.
4.0,Was perfect for my husband
4.0,Tunic length and a nice grey love the open shoulders and pretty sleeves
4.0,"Nice glasses, but you can't see green lights so be careful driving."
4.0,"Gloves are exactly as described.  Not to thick but not to thin.  The blue ones look black or it would have been 5 stars.<br />Nice when something is ""as described""."
4.0,Shower shoes
4.0,A little shinier than I would like but nice
4.0,"Definitely order a size bigger than usual. I ordered a 10/12 for my 10 yr old niece & it fit really tight. She normally wears a 10/12 in all her clothes. Other than that, it‚Äôs a very cute swim suit. I really like the style on her."
4.0,"Dress is cute. Came in a timely manner. Unfortunately has a rip in it and a little too big for me. This is a size medium. Hit a little below my knee and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7. I‚Äôm going to order this in orange and see if that come out without damage. Gave it three because it‚Äôs cute, fabric is comfortable, and it got here fast."
4.0,"It's okay. I wouldn't order it again, but meh"
4.0,"I had a bracelet like this years ago, and I was pleased to find one like it again. As a man of slender build, it is a bit large on me, and it isn't supposed to be adjustable, but I'm sure it can be done. I'm still not disappointed with the purchase and I won't be returning it. For the price, I am quite satisfied with this bracelet."
4.0,It is really heavy-duty and seems to be (after 4 weeks) a great watch.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little heavier than I had anticipated and the face does not have a light on it (even though I LOVE the light on it).
4.0,"Really well made jacket and my daughter loved it (a Christmas present), but, order at LEAST a size larger than you usually wear."
4.0,"Good bag, but I didn't realize it didn't have a carrying handle."
4.0,"I really liked these earrings, but they are huge and also heavy. I will still wear them because of how much I like them, but a little deceiving in the picture for size."
4.0,"Terrific casual sandal. Very comfortable, true to size. Low heel makes for easy walking. The wider look of it makes it a casual only style - but a great one."
4.0,"These are cute earrings considering the price, kinda look cheap,but I'm sure it depends on how you wear it.I give 4 star because its super late,3 days late.. after 1 month of waiting another days to wait again. But the earrings are bad at all.."
4.0,Very nice watch. My boyfriend collects watches and was very pleased with this addition. Would be nice if it came with an instruction booklet.
4.0,It's long. I need 34 x 29
4.0,good for what I use them for.A little bulky though.Like the case
4.0,1st one broke after a week but the 2nd one has lasted me because I know what I did wrong. My case is bulky and was trying to push it in and the pouch is fragile especially where the clip hard part attaches to plastic that is was came off so just hold it by the plastic only when putting you‚Äôre phone in. I didn‚Äôt want to return it since it had a 2nd one and I knew what I did and the price is amazing n u sometimes get what u pay for but having 2 really helps the when u make an oops on one lol. Unfortunately just like all the other pouches I have used even with other brands the home button doesn‚Äôt work but u can just click the lock button and or swipe and put in the passcode manually... 1st world problem lol
4.0,"I thought I was ordering one.. and it was a good price.  I was completely shocked that I got 4 pair.  Not kidding.. I have never got so many compliments in my life or comments on any glasses ever!  People love them!  Comments like.. hey.. what are you a moviestar (being funny of course when they say it).  The only thing is, they are very very dark so I do not feel super safe wearing them when driving or walking indoor.  Makes everything very dark.  But for hanging out at the pool, shopping etc.. very nice and look super cool!"
4.0,"this is agift for my grandaughter, I think it's lovely"
4.0,"Very good price, it's very detail and she love it, so I recommended!!!"
4.0,"It's pictured as white but what I recieved was offwhite. I'll still be wearing it, because the fabric is nice and it seems quality. But just fwi it's more of a cream."
4.0,"I used these as me and my wife's love bracelets before we even got engage, before we got rings and all. They're really cute and they last a long time if your careful to not get them caught on something. Good price as well."
4.0,"Right size, right stiffness in the cord, right price. Perfect eyeglass restrainer except that the cord tends to pull out of the rubber tube. This requires some ingenuity to fix."
4.0,"Love this tie, just wish it was about 6 inches longer"
4.0,Purchased this watch in gray. Stylish and practical for everyday wear.
4.0,Not too big or too small for my exact size.
4.0,"This is a cute set, and I love the color. I gave 4 stars cuz I expected the material to feel softer then it was, and the fit is a little clingy. Still, I will enjoy wearing for lounging."
4.0,somewhat small...but i like it
4.0,Only been wearing it a few days and it's already got me waking up and staying up when I'm supposed
4.0,Great lenses. Very clear vision. Work well in the bright sunlight.Couldn't tell a difference between these lenses and my Costas. They popped right into my Dvx Vizor frames without a problem.
4.0,"I ordered this just hoping that it would fit.  I love it!  It fits pretty well, if you're on the fence about a size, order up.  The material was a bit thicker than I expected, so a bit thick for summer.  The only downfall is that the strings tie right on your hips, so there's the potential to make your hips look a little big.  Still really glad I bought it."
4.0,nice necklace. Extremely well for the price I paid for.
4.0,My husband loved the color and feel of this polo shirt. Another big plus is the pockets on the front. He loves a shirt with pockets but it‚Äôs hard to find a polo shirt that has one let alone two front pockets. He feels that it‚Äôs a little too thin and needs to wear at shirt under it. It washed and dried good and needs no ironing after being laundered.
4.0,I am repeat customer
4.0,Daughter loves doll broke in 15 seconds but the bag has held up.
4.0,"A beautiful dress. The lace is very soft, not itchy at all. My only issue is that it is too long for my height, I'm 5'2. I will have to get it adjusted but overall was a good buy."
4.0,Very pretty & the right price!
4.0,"nice, good work, nice design. Specially, my wife love them. I'm glad."
4.0,One pair is smaller than the rest but it‚Äôs cool.
4.0,Loved this dainty chain.  It broke after 6 months which was disappointing but I plan to buy another one I liked it so well
4.0,Cute hats. The cute band around the hat doesn't stay in place so I cut it to the length of the ribbons hanging in back.  Much better this way for active little girls.  Of course the 2 little granddaughters fought over the color.  Both wanted pink. lol  I'll learn to get the same for each. :)
4.0,Although the material is very light . It was good and a perfect fit
4.0,"These dresses have a weird chest area, too low for a bra, the lower half is cute but kind of makes me look bigger than I am."
4.0,It is very nice. Could have been 3in larger. But I still love it
4.0,Me gusta como queda
4.0,Pretty good quality and my son really liked the graphic.
4.0,Have held up quite awhile. No pee hole has like a triangle shape. Not noticeable through the work day
4.0,These shirts are comfortable. Only thing I do not like is they are not loose as expected. I got the 2xl cause that's what I generally wear. They are still wearable but if your wanting them to fit loose and baggy order a size up.
4.0,This  dress was great to  wear with a  petticoat.  The breast area fit  smaller than expected.  I wore quarter length button up sweater to cover some of the cleavage. It gave the dress a real 50's look. Didn't care for material.  It wrinkled very easily
4.0,"This is an adorable dress. I love that it is modest with a touch of style. It has a high scoop neck and is fitted from the bust to waist. It flairs out from the waist which is really flattering. I love the mesh cutouts on the arms and hem. It adds a bit of sexiness and style to an otherwise pretty modest dress. The fit runs a little large. I am a 34‚Äù bust and the the size small was a little big in my bust and the top of my arms. At 5‚Äô5‚Äù the length falls perfectly to the top of my knees while the shortest mesh insert at the hem hits me mid thigh.<br /><br />The material has a really good stretch to it. The only negative I can say is the material is a bit thin. It‚Äôs black so its not see through, however I would have preferred a little better quality material. It‚Äôs some kind of polyester / spandex blend but feels thin and on the cheap side.  However for the price, I think it‚Äôs a nice addition to my closet. I can‚Äôt wait to wear this dress with a statement necklace and colorful pair of heels to dress it up even more!"
4.0,"The only reason im not giving it a 5 star is because before we wore the dresses i washed them. In the process of washing the bottom section of both dresses black stripes faded. In picture you can't tell but upclose they look as if id wash them about 10 or more times. That made me a bit peeved. Hence the 4 stars. (Dresses were washed together inside out with cold water on delicate). Besides that minor annoyance, The dresses were wonderful! Fit me perfectly.  My daughter's dress was a little big but not too bad that it took away from her being able to wear. Received several compliments on our outfit."
4.0,It runs small. So I reorder it and I got a size bigger
4.0,A little heavy to wear on t shirt
4.0,"I bought these for my husband for his Christmas pajamas and he loves them.  They were just a touch short, however, because he is 6'3&#34;.  Offering a longer inseam would be a great option."
4.0,The mask is okay but not as pictured. The visible stitching is white. I have to unstick it and sew it back together with black thread.
4.0,"I bought one just like it from Universal Studios, it got scratched in a few places and so I returned it and bought another one. The little tip on the bottom of the handle broke clean off after leaving :(. Not very strong but I would recommend it for gentle kids. I have not bought one here yet but I'm looking forward."
4.0,Beautiful color and style. I could have gone for a smaller size larger then I expected
4.0,I'm happywith this purchase it was a present for my daughter in law and she loved it the material iss very soft the color is true to the picture and if it's excellent.
4.0,I like it but I wish I had ordered a size bigger..
4.0,The right price for a simple mechanical watch that I can wear to work
4.0,"The bra didn't fit quite like I'd anticipated, but it will be good for most of my work outs. The crisscross was a little difficult to manage the first time I put it on, but it isn't too hard to figure out. Have received many compliments on this and many friends have asked where I got it."
4.0,"This bra is a tube top style with removable pads. The pockets that hold the pads seem to be quite a bit larger than the pads (this could be due to the size being an XL), but this allows the cups to move around so you'll need to re-position them after washing. The pads themselves are quite thick which I personally like because they actually offer coverage, but I have seen that others didn't care for that as much. There really isn't any support with this bra, which I've come to expect from tube top style bras. Due to this lack of support, I personally will only use it as a lounge bra but I could see it being more suitable for outside wear in smaller sizes."
4.0,Cool. nice shirt.
4.0,"I'm short, so naturally I'm drowning in this...would have loved for it to be available in a smaller size but can't win em all. Will still be a hilarious costume though with some alterations"
4.0,"It's pretty big but I should have just ordered a large. it is very comfortable and lightweight with two layers of fabric. It lies very straight so in order to show any curves, it's best to wear some kind of belt with it around your waist."
4.0,"Other people think it's a cool shirt, but I think it's just ok. Definitely unique though. Looks just like the picture. Comfortable. Since it's a loose fit, I ordered a size down because I didn't want to swim in it."
4.0,This came with a storage bag and instructions for cleaning and care. This product was easy to use and definitely does as advertised.  They are made of soft foam and the adhesive portion sticks to the bra instead of you. These are exactly what you would expect and a good value.
4.0,"I was looking for a particular evening gown, and the wrap and pairing this with red heels was attractive to me! The small size worked out for me, and it was just the right amount of tightness to it. My measurements were 36c, 28 waist and 36 hips. The material feels slightly thin, but still durable. This is perfect to wear to concerts or a evening date."
4.0,It's a sexy dress. It's a little loose for my liking. I'm gonna return it and get a medium.
4.0,"I bought these mainly so I could have a pair of durable athletic style glasses for rec beach volleyball. I liked how they had interchangeable lenses, but my only complaint is the yellow night vision lenses don't really work. Actually they made the glare of the lights on the court worse and a little harder to see the ball. The regular rainbow / polarized lenses work great for the sun. Functionality 4/5.<br />The fact that the yellow lenses did not help at night was offset by the fact that these glasses look great. Everyone knows the mantra look good, feel good, play good. Well the cause and effect of these beauties showed in the score line, because I looked great, felt great, and played great. I could tell the other team was a bit intimidated as the girl on the other side of the net never tried to block my spikes. I think she was too busy checking out my sweet shades. So far, undefeated with the glasses. The glasses stayed firmly snug on my sand covered face the entire time I had them on. Style 10/10.<br />These are a great value for the price, despite the flaw in the yellow lenses."
4.0,"I was looking for very large, wide hoops and I found them. These are almost comical in size but that's what I wanted and that's what I got.<br />Good quality, nice shiny color and the clasps are secure. They are a tad on the heavy side but you won't wear these every day."
4.0,Bought these for my bridesmaids to wear and they are beautiful!
4.0,Super silky not too thick tho
4.0,"These gloves are very stylish. I like the way they are designed. I can't really speak to how warm they would be in extreme cold, I live in the South. It was easy using my phone while wearing these."
4.0,"Beautiful top! Wore it for my mother‚Äôs 70th birthday party back in May. Unfortunately, the price is way too high for it not to hide the rolls I‚Äôd my midsection ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4.0,"Not a shirt you can wear a bra with, would have to wear a cami under it. But with that said it‚Äôs a good quality fabric and a very flattering fit. Runs a smog big. I‚Äôm a 10/12 I ordered a large could have pulled off a medium."
4.0,"This bra is super comfortable and fit perfectly, I‚Äôm a 34C btw. Wore it for a 9 hour road trip with ease. The only complaint I have is the padding over the nipple area... it wrinkles. You can‚Äôt feel it but you can see it which is unfortunate. I had a shirt over this so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal but if you wanted to wear this alone, it would look a little odd with the wrinkling bits in the front. I tried fixing this by hand but wasn‚Äôt able to smooth it out.  4 stars instead of 5 just because of the wrinkly pad."
4.0,"Great color, easy to install or uninstall. Comfortable"
4.0,Washes beautiful!
4.0,"Nice swimsuit, but I just didn't like the way the boylegs looked on me."
4.0,Husband likes them.  Says they fit nicely.
4.0,I liked the colors and the phrase  on it
4.0,Does everything it says it will.  Only a little thinner than I thought it would be.
4.0,Looks classy and dressy on an outfit.
4.0,"Exactly what I was expecting and its nice and big so I can actually tie the ends. The quality is great, seems like it will last awhile"
4.0,I loved the idea of these but they can be tight and have given me a headache and I feel as though they've set my glasses of balance on my face due to readjusting for comfort
4.0,Correct length but far to narrow with no width choices
4.0,Love the light weight breathable material!
4.0,This cross body bag is great for all the essentials. Great cell pocket and has zipper closure. Its also contains credit card slots and holds any money comfortably. Its very light and its so much better then carrying around a big chunky purse. The cross body strap is comfortable and doesn't hurt the shoulder.<br /><br />Its a great compliment to any outfit. Can be used during the day or a night on the town. It is very chic looking and I really like the zipper closure. The zipper is easy functioning and does not get caught when trying to open it.<br /><br />I recommend this cross body bag to anyone who wants to get out and have a small/convenient bag.
4.0,"Great hat,  my two year old grandsons love their tractor hat.  The quality is very good."
4.0,I wear 8-10 depending on the cut/style.  Large were too tight.  I ordered Xlarge.  A little big but I'm hoping after a wash/dry they will fit almost perfect.  They were mostly too big in waist so I'll have to wear a belt.  Color in thigh area not as black as rest of jean.  Very nice for the price vs Buckle brand which were $60+ after tax.
4.0,A decently made debossed rubber bracelet that does what it's supposed to (stay on your wrist). Lost a star because the pink paint on the cutie mark was applied poorly and I could see spots of purple rubber showing where it was supposed to be painted.
4.0,"The product did work as labeled, but I suspiciously guessed, after sniffing the strong odor that was present, that one of the ingredients (of which none were listed) was common liquid ammonia. I did a test with this laundry additive and got similar results."
4.0,"Good quality and made in the USA.<br />My only complaint is that they should make these a couple inches longer for those of us who have big wrists , like a loose fit or want to wear this over top of a shirt or jacket sleeve.<br />I'd rather have a strap that's too long than too short. If it were too long it could always be cut to size and the ends burned so they didn't fray.<br /><br />I bought this strap in black ops/brigade black size 20mm for a Suunto M-9 wrist compass.<br />I really like the color and that the hardware of the black ops version is non reflective.<br />It fits this compass well and looks great!<br /><br />Again , my only complaint is that it's too short.<br />It fits my wrist , barely , but could not be worn over the sleeve of a fleece if I were using it in cooler weather...<br /><br />Update -<br />I've gotten used to this watchband and like it.<br />I still think it should be a little longer but it does fit. I'm not sure whether it stretches slightly or if I got used to it and desired it a bit tighter but I started out using the 3rd hole on the band and am now using the 4th.<br />I wear this in the shower and scrub it with a soft bristle toothbrush to clean the sweat and grime off or it , the same way I clean my watch and watch band."
4.0,I bought this dress for a funeral. It was acceptable.
4.0,Cute bathing suit. Originally ordered it in a 4x but it was too small so have it to a friend.  The  5x fits better but could be a little longer in the torso area. This bathing suits run very small as I normally wear a 10 USA size in pants and a 1x top. The main problem is the torso area is just a little short but it fits and looks very cute. Would be more comfortable if the torso was just an inch or two longer. It is well made and very different than all the swimdresses out there I do get lots of compliments when I have worn it.
4.0,Wore it for my second look for my bday very nice dress
4.0,"THIS DRESS IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. I GOT THE KHAKI COLOR AND  DUE TO ITS COLOR IT IS A BIT SEE THROUGH BUT IF YOU WEAR A SLIP UNDER IT'S PERFECTLY FINE. THE MATERIAL IS GOOD, AND THE LENGTH IS PERFECT FOR ME (THE LENGTH DROPS TO KNEES) , I AM 4'10 SO I AM ON THE SHORTER SIDE. AFTER WASHED, THE DRESS GOT A TINY BIT SHORTER, BUT BEING SHORT IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE TO ME, IT SHRINK LIKE 1.5-2 INCH (IF YOU ARE A TALL PERSON ...IT MAY FALL ON THE SHORTER END, BUT IF YOUR ARE OKAY WITH SHOWING A LITTLE BIT OF LEGS, IT'S TOTALLY WORTH GETTING THIS DRESS BECAUSE IT'S SUPER CUTE AND I THINK IT WILL STILL BE A GOOD LENGTH AFTER WASH. I WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER FROM THIS PARTICULAR SELLER AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED ORDERING THIS SAME EXACT STYLE DRESS FROM OTHER SELLERS, AND THAT DID NOT TURN OUT GOOD, THE QUALITY OF THE FABRIC WAS NOT GOOD AND IT SMELLED BAD."
4.0,"The dress fit really well, and the material was nice. I was worried it would be scratchy, but it definitely was not. Beautiful colors.<br />My only complaint is that the middle (3 belt-like lines) hit above the belly so the dress had more of a baby doll style than what appears in the photo. I'm 5'6&#34;, B/C cup so no unusual pull to bring it up. A baby doll style is not particularly flattering on me, but I liked the colors so I wore it anyway.<br />I'm still giving it a 4 because it was well made, especially for the price. Just FYI on the fit."
4.0,Not as heavy as I expected but definitely heavier than your average store bought sweat shirt this will do.
4.0,Fits quite well. the fabric is very soft and hood strings adjust to different sizes of the head. Matches well with this mask I recently bought and feels like an excellent combo. Hopefully this will help fend off the cold temperatures of winter.
4.0,"I'm very happy with the dress which I use for lounging on cold winter nights.  I'm about 5'3 1/2"" and it reaches almost to my ankles.  The material is soft, not very heavy, and it hangs well but it's not something I would wear outside of the house.<br /><br />It's described as a wedding, evening party dress, but the fabric is not dressy.  It's comfortable as a lounging robe."
4.0,"Love the fitting! Quality is great and fit is expected. Only reason i didnt put 5 stars coz  the shirt gets crumpled so easily! I had to iron it everytime i have to wear it and just after an hour or so of wearing, it looks crumpled again."
4.0,This is perfect for my pirate costume.  The dark brass color is great.  Chain length is perfect but the chain is weak.  Not a fan of the design on the other side of the coin but I like that it‚Äôs double sided.  Worth the price
4.0,"I love this dress for work, but the belt is fake. The is not a real belt it's like metal wrapped around your tummy that does not lay well. I had to bend it to make it look presentable and hand wash the dress. It's a good-looking dress, but if you are wanting a dress that has a real belt a not a look just for the day, you will need to get another dress, but this dress is nice on."
4.0,"While clearly an excellent mask for the novice and professional ninja, I purchased it primarily for winter sports.  It is extremely comfortable while skiing and snowboarding, and the touch of silk while sitting upon the lifts seems to provide a calm soothing feeling to offset the pain from my numerous falls on the moguls.  It keeps you cool from your own body heat but simultaneously keeps your face warm despite the freezing temperatures around you.  It is very breathable, but my only issue was that it did trap the moisture of my breath."
4.0,Great buy !i like that I‚Äôm able to change lenses anytime.
4.0,Nice cardigan I would suggest ordering a size down
4.0,Much more durable then ones I've gotten at Walmart in the past! Will buy again in the future!
4.0,"I like it, is what I expected.  Will wash I'm cold water and line dry since it has cotton in it."
4.0,Buena calidad y material.
4.0,This romper is gray for the beach because it‚Äôs easy to put on and can be dressed up with heels or more comfortable fitted by wearing sandals. The flair legging for my 5 foot 3 inch body without having to do alterations which is difficult when it comes to rompers. The fabric is very breathable too!
4.0,"some I will keep, maybe some for gifts (there are 12 in the box)"
4.0,You pay your money and you take your chances. These are not really good quality but should not have been expected to be any more than they are. Certainly were cheap.
4.0,Good full coverage underwear. I wanted boy shorand style so I could have a little more coverage at night. I normally wear a large so that‚Äôs what I ordered. It fits fine though I wish the band was just a little looser or at least softer.
4.0,"This necklace is attractive and the chain is sturdy; moreover, the metal is skin friendly.<br /><br />The trouble is that the pendant is really small, so small it seems as though it was meant to be an earring.<br />To try to give you an idea of the size, I included photographs with the necklace next to a dime.<br />I hope that comparison will give everyone a sense of how it might look.<br /><br />Obviously, I was a tad disappointed by the dimensions of the pendant , which feels like it disappears on my neck.<br />At the same time, if you prefer jewelry that is diminutive, are looking for a gift for a girl/young lady, or plan to add charms, beads, or other pendants to the chain, this might be an ideal you."
4.0,"I really like the black color but end up ordering this because it's out of stocks already, this is very nice and fits perfectly to my face that is not do small,because this is quite having a big lenses....with a colorful frame and a black lenses makes it looks elegant..even the handles that holds the ears really looks nice with a combo og gold and black color..got thus with a discounted price in exchange of my honest review."
4.0,"The snaps keep coming undone around the bottom, it's not a true xl or maybe it's more of a youth's xl. Also not much room for layering underneath."
4.0,"I wear a size 6 and these are a little big, but the quality and comfort are very nice.<br />If they stayed on I give them 5 stars."
4.0,Fits perfectly. It's super cute! Can't wait to wear it on my trip to Mexico.
4.0,Just what we needed / extra umbrellas for the cars / they worked great
4.0,"Good quality and comfortable, the only reason I only gave four stars is that there was a bad toxic odor.  It went away after one wash!"
4.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but does not fit up to an 8 1/2 inch wrist as described. I'm going to gift it someone who has a smaller wrist."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable but only for cup B and less.
4.0,Nice quality. Lightweight. Easy to wear.<br /><br />Image is unclear. Black is basically gray so all you see are the bluish Celtic knots.
4.0,"It arrived in about 18days. I like the look of the hat. A little snug but, it works..."
4.0,"Bought this for a fortnite costume. It looks great, works great. It's not very loud though. That's the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars."
4.0,This Shaket was so soft and warm but not scratchy at all.  super cute!
4.0,I ordered a half size larger than my normal size which is a 10 and there is a little bit of room towards the back.  I'll take it!  Pretty comfortable while walking around the house.
4.0,Very nice men purse. Good quality and useful
4.0,"These socks are cute, soft and adorable. Would recommend."
4.0,"I feel like this bra is well made, however, just a tad loose on the band and the straps. I got a medium and the cups fit perfect. If I got a small, I don't think the cups would fit. Would purchase if I could get the sizing right."
4.0,Its a shell.  Good pocket layout with a hood that is shapeable with a wire.  It should be just about perfect for Arizona cool and dry.
4.0,Very pretty. A little heavy. Great for the price.
4.0,"I'm 6'1"" and about 173 pounds with medium muscular build.  I typically choose to wear Size Medium in men's shirts, rather than Large, which would be baggy on me.  I never wear Size Small.  Based on this, I ordered this shirt in Size Medium, and it fits me like I'd expect a Size Large to fit me.  So, for the fit I like, I guess I'd have to order a Size Small?!?  Very odd.  I'd suggest that you order a size smaller than you typically order.<br /><br />Once you get past the sizing, this shirt is super nice.  The fabric is soft and comfortable (not as soft or comfortable as cotton, but good for polyester), it's well made with no loose threads or poor seams, and the styling is very hip.  The metal tips on the ends of the hood drawcord are a nice touch that adds flair to the design.  I love the front pockets for your hands like what you're used to seeing on a hooded sweatshirt.<br /><br />The polyester fabric will not hold sweat like cotton, but it also won't breathe as well as cotton.  So, there is a tradeoff.  I do like the stretchiness of the fabric, which is due to some spandex content in the fabric.<br /><br />At $18.99, I think this shirt is an excellent value.  I am only rating this shirt 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the sizing is off.  I never would have expected that I'd need to order a Size Small to fit me.  If you order 1 size smaller than you'd typically order, I think you will love this shirt."
4.0,"Great dress. Little see thru, but nice fit."
4.0,Different material than I expected but still cute. Haven't worn it yet but for the price I paid I'm happy with the quality.
4.0,"This piece is great. Feels very durable and is heavy. My only concerns, although minor, are that the colors on the rope are reversed and the stone is rather dull."
4.0,"A little large. I wear a 10 in tennis shoes, but these were a little large. Have to double up socks and might also do a foam insole."
4.0,"Easy to switch, comfortable and washable"
4.0,"It runs a tiny bit fast, but I haven't had a problem with it needing excessive winding as is mentioned in other reviews.  The watch part is a little bit big and clunky, but it looks good otherwise (and most people think it's more expensive than it is).  You get a good range of adjustment on the wrist band to find the best fit"
4.0,"Very nice material, beautiful baby blue color fits true to size.  I'm 5'7"" 150 lbs in good shape for a 55yr (young) woman and I still have extra room and enough length for my 2 1/2 heels.  Looking forward to wearing this weekend for a function."
4.0,"I‚Äôm  5‚Äò5‚Äú, 110 pounds, a 32B, and usually wear a size 2 or extra small. The small dress fits nicely."
4.0,"5'2"" 140 lbs. Normally a medium, ordered a small based on previous reviews and it fits nicely.  Pocket do add extra bulk in the hip area though."
4.0,The  costume was good quality.  My 13 year old is a men‚Äôs large usually. The shirt fit great. The vest was a little big. The pants fit until you got to the thighs and waist. There is no stretch to any of the material. We ordered some purple jogging pants from Amazon to use instead of those pants and it worked great!
4.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, sequins are more separated and there is an off sew line behind the flower. It will work for pictures but not what I was expecting!"
4.0,"Very cute, arrival was on time. Not a very good quality; as expected for the price though."
4.0,Like the stretch. Colors are nice.
4.0,well made fits like a glove
4.0,"Well made, fits well, is comfortable, good price. No complaints."
4.0,"This dress is magnificent. inknew the fabric wouldn't be (time)period appropriate, so taking that into account, it's fabulous. The fit is a bit larger than the size chart provided though.... I purchased an XXL. I'm a 44.5&#34; bust, 36&#34; waist. ***The chart stated &#34;XXL: Bust 40.6-42.9 Inches,Waist 35.0 Inches,Total Length 41.7 Inches.***** the dress fits me perfectly. There is some stretch in it, but it isn't stretched on me. Collar is lovely. I'll wear this a great deal."
4.0,Really Big and beautiful-
4.0,These atell LARGE even on a adul! Other then that they are very shiny and looks real but as I said if your not looking for something LARGE these are not for you.
4.0,"I so want this to fit me, beautiful shirt and made well"
4.0,I like how this fits me and without doing much my whole core started to warm up instantly. I wore a tanktop underneath the vest and after working out it was wet all over. Not drench. The only dislike i have is that its a pain in the neck to take off and on. I got a large and it fits right and goes near my crouch region. Again it just sucks to take on and off. Probably should have gotten a size bigger but the size chart is accurate. I would a get size larger for easier access.
4.0,Ok so I have received lots of compliments when I wore these earrings! They were my first big pair and I will now order more expensive pair sense I know big ones look nice on me lol... I will def as well order from this company again. The only reason I'm giving 4 is because they did bend a little but I fixed it. They are classy and you could dress them up or down : )
4.0,They arrived quickly as advertised and are a good fit. However the material makes vision slightly blurry thus unfortunately had to return.
4.0,"I bought this to tie-dye for a field trip (I'm a teaching assistant) to match kids' shirts. I had to wear a tank top and a slip under this dress because it was so see-through, but someone wearing it in a more casual setting might not choose to. Very comfortable and worked great!"
4.0,Material is good and it‚Äôs what I wanted but it‚Äôs a little  bit short for a 5‚Äô10‚Äù girl.<br />Btw so far I has 2 random people asked me where dis I buy it from because they liked it.
4.0,"Super cute. I like the Peony ones the most ,right length and right gauge size."
4.0,Stitching on the outside is strange and is coming out on a few of the shirts but it's not needed.<br />Wears good
4.0,"Nice and very comfy. The material is thin, but since it's clearly a summer sleep shirt, that's OK for me. The lenght is perfect too, it reaches mid-thight. The only detail is that the letters don't really glow in the dark... It doesn't bother me, because I didn't buy it for that, but it shouldn't be advertised as &#34;glow&#34;."
4.0,"Super cute Jumper! As described and fits slightly off the shoulder (and I have broad shoulders). For reference, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 115lbs and the small fits perfectly. May be a little short for someone taller, but I wear slightly bunched as capris. Fabric is a little thicker and not sure how it will wash, but I think it‚Äôs perfect for spring/summer/fall. Can dress up of down."
4.0,"the watch is beautiful to wear, but the dial is kind of heavy so if you wear it for an extended time, your arm will start hurting."
4.0,"I absolutely love these, I‚Äôve had tons of different brands and these fit perfect.  It‚Äôs a bike short that‚Äôs not too long, very flattering"
4.0,Cute but runs small in arms. Its a little tight kn arms but still love it
4.0,"Pretty nice pale blue color. Great price. I deducted a star, because the gift bag they come with is ugly.  The picture doesn't do the blue color justice."
4.0,Good quality and it doesn't look cheap. The only thing is doesn't come with the choker necklace as promise.
4.0,I loved the product because they fit and didn't have to go to an over crowded mall or store
4.0,Turns green very very fast
4.0,Wish more sizes were available this one is a bit large but great design and material
4.0,Hot n sexy. Shows a nice bulge. Comfortable.
4.0,The product is satisfactory and works fine
4.0,"The pearls are beautiful and exactly what I expected,.  My only reservation, I wish it had a prettier clasp."
4.0,It's a little long. I thought it would. Love the material how it feels
4.0,Very pretty.  The bracelet is too small but set is still worth the price.
4.0,I have these shoes in black and nuede. The can‚Äôt really walk in heels so this height and support work well. I gave these shoes a 4 star only because the strap on my toes gets kinda painful after awhile. Otherwise good price and good quality.
4.0,Just a little less support as the halter ties around the neck and stretches as not to fit snug.  But a beautiful suit to lounge in.
4.0,"Great earrings. They are durable, look great and the price is right!"
4.0,"I like the style and fit. I don't like how thin the fabric is. I wanted for spring, fall and winter wear. Ok for late spring, early fall but to thin for winter. These are as thin as my under armor. I wouldn't wear these under another shirt because of the A-line shape. I bought (3) 3 packs for a total of 9 tees because the price was good per piece. I will be sending 3 black and 1 dark grey to the goodwill because I don't wear black. I would suggest to this company to put together some groupings that don't include black for those of us who don't wear black. Like grey, taupe, brown or grey taupe, ivory or grey, taupe, pink or grey, ivory, blue....you get my drift."
4.0,good band but feels stiff and rubs my wrist.
4.0,"I didn't get the correct color and it doesn't have a way to button but other than that it's good. I'm getting a new one resent, they were really fast to help me out"
4.0,"Not as good as a $50 one, but it did the job and was on-par for what you'd expect to get for the price."
4.0,I like these pants..  I ordered a 2x which I normally order in spandex as to not have it cutting me into and these were  rather large in the waist for me.  Akso the material is very flimsy.. More like nylon.
4.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet, especially for the price! I love it is one size fits all; it expands & contracts to your wrist. Lovely work!"
4.0,Nice hat.  My friend really likes it.  It was a birthday present.
4.0,I love it but I thought it would be biger still I love it
4.0,"Charm was as pictured. The ""t"" a little difficult to see, but it was there. All in all nice charm."
4.0,They're a little looser than they appear
4.0,"He uses the watch a lot. He wears it when he isn't wearing his other two, it was a great watch."
4.0,"Very comfy and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to wear. Super soft. The material is definitely on the thin side, but doesn‚Äôt look cheap. Love the pockets of course! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it hits below my knee."
4.0,Received lots of compliments on this piece
4.0,love this bag. it's big enough for all my junk and the color is nice. wish there were more colors.
4.0,Great Christmas present.
4.0,"Adorable little (1‚Äù diameter) metal pin.  Only problem? The catch isn‚Äôt secure, but a squeeze with pliers will remedy that."
4.0,I like the skirt but the tail is too long and I'm 4‚Äô9 so I may have to buy platform boots because I don't want to cut it.
4.0,I was shopping for the magnet closer wallet that I love and is showing wear after 5-6 years. I didn't read careful enough but I still like the confirmation of the insides. Color is just what I wanted.
4.0,"I like that this is a bit longer than tennis skirts/skorts, but it is still about 3 1/2 inches above my knees.  It is nice material, and seems well-made.<br />Also, size was way small.  It is stretchy, but was too small to really get on. I wear a size 10,  at 140 pounds, and 5'9"",  so ordered a M which I returned. I ordered a size L and it is pretty small too.  If you wear a 10 normally, an XL would work. The description says for golf with pockets, but the pockets are  not big enough for golf balls.  It looks like it will be good for errands, and ok for golf."
4.0,They were a bit smaller than advertised.
4.0,These are very pretty earrings.  The size and the color of the pearls are great.  The quality is also nice.  I would recommend these anytime.
4.0,"Great Hat!  Just wish it didn't have a logo on the front... I don't even know what the logo represents, but the hat is warm!"
4.0,"construction of the garment was not as I would expect but, I corrected most of the flaws. Cute otherwise."
4.0,Maybe i should have gotten it a little smaller so it would work better but seems like a good product so far
4.0,I order a size bigger amd didn't need to. Great material and cery comfortable.
4.0,"I am in LOVE with this shirt! But I ordered a XL due to big bust size and it fits like a Small or a Small fitting Medium. Hoping to exchange it, because I don‚Äôt want to let it go!!! The matieral is not stretchy, it‚Äôs very form fitting and it‚Äôs not too thin or too thick. Seems like it would be perfect to go under a heavy coat or a light jacket, but that‚Äôs just my opinion! I live in Texas where winter and summer weather alternate within the same week! Last week we had 3 inches of snow and it was a high of 30 degrees outside and 2 days later it was 79 degrees out and the snow was obviously gone lol! This is no lie! If it weren‚Äôt for my big boobs it would‚Äôve fit better lol!!! I have nothing bad to say about it at all besides it fitting too small!!! But I should‚Äôve paid attention better to other comments I‚Äôve seen, saying that the shirt fits small. But I didn‚Äôt notice the comments till days after I very excitedly ordered the beautiful shirt!!! It was shipped to me today on March 2nd and wasn‚Äôt supposed to arrive till sometime between, March 12 & April 2nd. So shipping was extremely fast and I ordered it on February 17 and that was with free shipping! I haven‚Äôt spoke to the seller yet, but when I do I will update my review and my stars and hopefully it will be good news for me and I‚Äôll be able to have no trouble getting it exchanged! I included 2 pictures. The first one shows the cute elbow pads with the red and black flannel print! I contacted the seller to get a larger size since the shirt fit like a medium and they informed me I bought the largest size. They were very nice to me and told me to maybe gift the shirt to a family member or a friend and they offered to give me a $2.19 refund without returning the shirt because they said the shipping would cost a lot to send to them. I highly recommend this seller!!! The shirt is so cute in person I just wish it would‚Äôve fit me!"
4.0,C√≥modas pero el tal√≥n debe calzar justo o ser√° una incomodidad.
4.0,Great fit and comfortable was exactly what I wanted.
4.0,Cute face mask with adjustable fittings on each side.  Fabric on outside is silky and and cotton on the inside and bendable nose fitting.  Did show wear on the elastic after washing.  Get comments on how cute the mask is.
4.0,"Very heavy, but pretty."
4.0,I have a small face and these sunglasses let in sunlight at the top.
4.0,"Cute watch, but not so easy to determine time."
4.0,"Well made , very happy"
4.0,"This dress is a large mumu. The belt cinched at the wait giving you a flattering figure. The dress at $30 is a wonderful price. It is well made and has an in we linning with a sheer layer on top.<br />I bought an XS, I'm 5'4, 108 lbs, 32 busy, 27 waist.<br />The sheer part of the dress is long, and I wore 4 inch wedge sandals. When I wore flats, I had to hold parts of the dress up so not to trip on it.<br />Once you get the belt, I would advise you to start supergluing the accessories and ends of it prior to wearing the belt.  The belt will fall apart easily!!! I bought two dresses and the first belt fell apart after I tried it on 1 time! The second belt, I superglued the edges and I haven't had an issue with it falling apart. This is a beautiful dress but wish the belt was better made.<br />Returning the other dress I didn't want was easy. I ended up keeping the purple dress and returned the green one. Both beautiful."
4.0,"I found the bifocal part of the lens a little to high, shouyof been slightly lower."
4.0,fit very well easy to clean. fast shipping  thanks
4.0,"Very comfy, though the color is much darker than expected."
4.0,Love it but it was too long I‚Äôm 5 2
4.0,"Cheaply made but i am very impress, i love it so far. It is exactly like the picture."
4.0,If you wear a med. order a large. They seem to run a bit smaller.
4.0,Love love love the style and quality of these earrings but I had to return them as the posts are rather thick and they could not fit through my ear holes.
4.0,Gorgeous for faux opals... Best looking nipples in townüòä...<br />Came with an extra piece I believe to be a tongue barbel... Have no use for it though... Over all totally satisfied
4.0,"Love this beanie so much, very perfect for what I wanted, I even ordered it in white!!<br />Black one didn‚Äôt come with the hair tie though, the white one did"
4.0,Blue lens still seems like smoke view. I wanted blue.
4.0,"This is a great belt - very comfortable and pretty. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because the clasp portion of it is completely different than pictured. Luckily, it still works for what I wanted it for, but if you are purchasing it because you like the leaves, you may want to reconsider. The one I received is unlike any of the style options."
4.0,Good deal. But you do get what you pay for.  But nice over-all. And these colors are great. You could match your Sun Glasses to your shirt. A very sharp look.
4.0,"comfortable, but had a little blister on my heal from them.  Will be fine."
4.0,"Super cute, just too bad that it runs so small. I usually wear a medium and I bought an XL and it was still too small."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, however one broke after a few weeks. The hoop part, came open so the dangle parts came off! I was able to find all the beads and chain pieces to put it back together. It was an easy fix, but it still comes apart every now and then. Otherwise, cute earrings!"
4.0,"Love the fit and look of this dress. The waist is elastic, so it‚Äôs not a true wrap dress, but it looks like one! I‚Äôve received many compliments on this dress-I even wore it for family photos!"
4.0,La tela se transparenta un poco
4.0,"The bag is well made and looks nice but I was sent the wrong color. Advertised as tan (khaki) received military green. Over all I would suggest this bag. Tons of pockets and storage space, fits comfortably. Looks great"
4.0,Now with this product... I ordered because my son begged for a mini binder for Pokemon! It is just that! BUT there are just hardly any slots inside the binder! I figured there would at least be plenty of slots for cards or options to add more slots but there isnt. For that I was upset but product is as it says it is!
4.0,"This product works, its not the best but for the price it is 100% functional....."
4.0,"I'm 5'11 and 350lbs. The XXL was baggy and cute! It had a strange smell when I opened the bag. It's very cute, though!"
4.0,"ok for the money it's cute, but you will be repairing it after a couple of uses. still pretty creative and totally goth.  i like it."
4.0,I got this for Father's Day and within a couple of days it peeled a bit and now the tiny bit of corner is missing. Seems like it will be pretty easy to just print my own picture and attach it to fix it myself. I still totally think it was worth it though but I suggest sealing it with something before gifting.
4.0,Slightly loose but perfect length. I wish it had pockets!
4.0,My daughter is a 8.5c. They fit but just barely. I recommend sizing up. Good buy overall as compared to the price of real crocs.
4.0,"My granddaughter loved them, but unfortunately, they have rubbed some blisters."
4.0,It fits a swatch watch the band was very stiff for a few days but it got better. It is does not say Swatch on it but for the price it is pretty close to the real deal.
4.0,"Great dress very comfortable, hides everything ;) the only downside is the ‚Äúoff the shoulder‚Äù it elastic around the neck and shoulder area and doesn‚Äôt really stay off the shoulder. But it‚Äôs still cute and I‚Äôm going to order another color"
4.0,"I ordered one dress in medium.  Was surprised to find 2 in the package, labled as Large but fits as Medium.  Really nice texture to the material - does not feel like cotton, feels silky.  Will be perfect to slip on to go to the pool or wear around on a 90+ degree day."
4.0,"Love the gloves, shrunk the first pair in the wash. Now my other half has gloves too ( shell shrunk, liner didn't. Don't machine wash.)"
4.0,They're cute and seem comfortable but the straps don't really buckle. I'll see if the actually stay on.
4.0,What I expected. Big enough to hold all my things for work. Colour same as in the picture. Love it
4.0,"I bought this beautiful wrap dress and I was not disappointed when it arrived.<br />I wear a u.s size 10/12, so I ordered a large and the fit and look was as described with the pictures. The material is transparent but not flimsily thin and the dress goes well with heels.<br />I got a lot of compliments when I wore this dress, and I will recommend it to other buyers.<br />The 4 (instead of 5) star rating is for the price."
4.0,The fit is perfect for my Fitbit Versa 2.
4.0,Unfortunately the zipper broke on the top pocket of one of the fanny packs. I had to return as they were a gift for my folks who are on their way to South America and that's not going to work out for them. I did get a refund when I returned them. I liked the fact that I got two for the price of one but it just didn't work out for me.
4.0,"My niece calls it &#34;elegant,&#34; and is the envy of her school girl friends. I thought it would be sloppily made, but was pleasantly surprised at how nicely and sturdily made it is."
4.0,My little girl loves this skirt but it does have a funny smell.
4.0,Quality is pretty good and you can't beat the price! Haven't worn it yet so not sure how it will hold up after chemicals and washings but we'll see.
4.0,"My only drawback with the sports bra is the color; I thought I was getting a dusty rose however in person and on it is more brown with a twinge of pink shade. I would have gone with the black. Otherwise, I like the fit and support with pad removal option. I‚Äôm a small/medium normally and went off of the sizing guide for a small on this; would agree with the fit. The material is nice and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap."
4.0,I own several pairs of 90 Degree by Reflex.  I decided to try this pair since my normal model was out of stock. I felt this was a bit too shiny and not as compressive as my other pair of High Waist Power Flex Capri. The side pocket was nice.
4.0,"Durable, comfortable and looks okay"
4.0,I just recently went to multiple countries in Europe and one was Switzerland. I bought  a Pandora charm bracelet in Europe and started collecting them for every country I went to. This Dog charm is the charm for Switzerland.  I decided not to buy when in Europe as I wasn't sure that I liked the Dog.  I wish I had purchased in Switzerland but  due to cost and what I had already spent on my other charms I opted out.  I am so very pleased to find it on Amazon to complete my bracelet of my first trip to Europe.  Definitely cant beat the cost as well!
4.0,"Nice and cheap necklace, very good product."
4.0,Good value for the money. Not the highest quality but still lots of selection.
4.0,"Decent quality. Feels just like the FitBit brand ones. Only issue is the rubber started peeling near my wrist after a few months for an unknown reason. It doesn't constantly rub anything in those areas. Not sure if its sweat or what. It doesn't bother me too much, look-wise.<br /><br />After seeing the issue in my original review, RedTaro shipped me a new band and had excellent customer service so I will add an extra star!"
4.0,This is a very tiny ear rings which is exactly what I want. Very cute!
4.0,For reference... 5‚Äô7‚Äù 200lbs 36c. This dress is quite short but very cute. Fabric is thin so don‚Äôt plan on wearing dark panties. Overall super cute for the price point and even fits my curves
4.0,Very pleased with the product so far. The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am not quite sure how the metallic coating will hold up to falls or scratches.
4.0,I love this purse but I am only giving it four stars because after only one use the little pearl on the chain fell off and then a week later the jewel fell off the heart.  I was disappointed because that was the part I liked the most.  The rest of the purse is very well made and love the addition of the zippered pouch.  I use it for all the store coupons and receipts.  My purse arrived very quickly.
4.0,fits well everywhere but my legs lol
4.0,Super cute! Really liked but just didn‚Äôt fit me.
4.0,Very good product but a little pricecy.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:aa660c9f70804b613363cfe1f65794af]] Bonito y Resistente contra el agua
4.0,"Works well, a little big for a small faced adult. However, after washing It did shrink. The fabric was comfortable given that I‚Äôm wearing this on and off for 8+ hours a day."
4.0,Only critique is that one of the headbands has come a little unraveled after the first wash
4.0,"For a silver plated charm, these are nice. The only thing that didn't rate it a 5 is the fact that the hole is really large but that's the only issue."
4.0,"not a very stretchy fabric and shoulders are a bit wide set, even for me (and I have rather broad shoulders) but other than that it is very comfortable and cute and I love wearing it!"
4.0,"I was bummed because I had ordered these last year and really liked their fit. I just ordered another pack and they are all too big. The company is sending something to help with that, but just disappointed because I really liked the fit the first time around."
4.0,"Looks good, price is good. One of the pins came out for the band by itself and I had to put it back in. Otherwise, no problems yet. It's pretty light and doesn't feel that durable, it's probably not going to take a ton of use or abuse, but again...the price and looks makes it worth it to me."
4.0,"Cute outfit. Nice and lightweight, not too heavy.  Perfect for my little guy this spring."
4.0,I bought those shirts for my nephews for Christmas so I don't know how they fit them. I bought their sizes so all I can do is hope they fit.
4.0,"This dress fits great, nice stretch held me in, nice to have. Material is thick enough not see through, will buy again in another color"
4.0,"Well, I thought we had a fogging winner.........until today.  Been using them for a month.  I never allow anything to touch the inside of the lens....including water.  I'd put them on dry, and remove them being careful not to allow water inside.  They've been great so not sure why they decided to fog today.  Hocked a lugi in there, and that cleared up the issue, but at least they cost a lot less than my Aqua Spheres that also fog."
4.0,I bought this product to replace the band that comes with the watch. It is comfortable and easy to wear. T
4.0,Good fit.  Color lighter than expected.
4.0,Nice wallet... It's exactly as described and the material is pretty good.
4.0,I like the look and color of these running shoes. They're a cheery coral color.  The shoes also fit me well. I have wide feet and recently have developed pain from bunions.  These are wide enough to be comfortable and allow me to exercise for my usual time without pain.
4.0,This is a cute and fashionable scavenger the fall.  The colors are bright and festive for the season.  The material is soft and can be worn all day long.
4.0,"Cute dress, but under the white fur is very scratchy.  Under the red parts, its not as bad."
4.0,Took a star away due to how complicated it was to latch the claps. It was so difficult to lock the claps that it left my ear swollen and in pain for days. Once I was able to it looks great and is comfortable.
4.0,My thirteen year old daughter loved it! It was a little big though. She‚Äôs 4 feet tall and 95 pounds. Wish it came in sizes.
4.0,Loved it! Blue rhinestones looked extreme fake and way too large.  Wearing it without them.
4.0,I shouldn't have assumed it was wider like most gun belts.  It is no wider than the golf or dress version Nexbelt. It is stiffer and stronger  than original but I prefer wider. I have several Nexbelt and the ratchet system is terrific.
4.0,Great fit and attractive garment
4.0,"fits well, washes well, not fading quickly, my son loves it decent value"
4.0,"Good for lady, but not for man"
4.0,"This is my second one of these tops. I use them for yoga mostly. I bought this one a couple of sizes too big as I wanted it to be big and flowy but unfortunately it's just too big and floppy and shapeless, my own fault really but I've had it taken in and it's great. I often get compliments on it. The color is as shown. I also have the mint color and it is also as shown."
4.0,"I really love this watch. The main reason for a watch is of course time, and this watch is on the ball.  Even though it's call automatic it does need to be wound as all automatics do.  I had one as a kid and back then it was called self winding.  I wind it when I put it on in the morning and then it does it's thing all day.  The following morning the time is still perfect.  I love the way it looks too, being able to see all the movements fascinates me.  The one problem I have had is that sometimes one side of the clasp opens on it's own.  I don't know if it is a defect in my particular watch or a bad design.  It doesn't happen frequently enough for me to address it with the company.  Also, when I needed to remove one link to adjust the band, the tool provided came apart but it was an easy fix and it lives to fight another day.  I think the watch is a good value for the money, I am glad that I bought it and I enjoy wearing it."
4.0,Soft and comfy! Even the straps are padded! Love the color- true navy!
4.0,This is not for drying yourself off but if you need it to cover while at spa or walking around at gym it‚Äôs perfect
4.0,Very cute and comfy shirt! My only complaint is that it is abit loose at the top
4.0,"I personally don't like the color of this item (I got the orange one)... it's just a personal color issue though. The top wasn't as long as I'd hoped. I ordered a large, and it didn't fit all the way under my breasts, which was slightly uncomfortable, but it's easy to stretch and stuff"
4.0,I bought 2 pairs (one for each of my sisters) for Christmas and they loved it! The bright colors and design were a hit!!
4.0,"I purchased the royal blue one and received so many compliments, I had to get the sunny yellow one! I love large face 38mm and larger,  so they are perfect for me. Great price doesn't hurt either! Gave 4 stars bkuz the strap gets stained if u wear something over it."
4.0,"The tunic of size XXL is very large. The actual breast volume is about 50 inches, which does not correspond to the size chart. Welded qualitatively. The material is pleasant."
4.0,Very nice! Not cheaply made.
4.0,"I bought two of these belts on a recent daily deal.  The latch system works very well for me and adjusting (cutting) the length of the belt to my size was not a problem.  I noticed that the latch position is different by about an inch on the two belts I received, due to a design variation.  On one, the belt plate is lifted to loosen the belt and the latch is on the left side of the plate.  On the other, a small lever is pulled forward to accomplish the same thing and the latch is on the right side of the plate.  If you're wanting to precisely match belt lengths on more than one belt, note the position of the latch tab on each one.  For me, not a big issue either way.<br />As others have mentioned, the bonded leather is not great quality.  When looking at the first belt that I've been wearing for just 6 days, there is already some very slight peeling along the outer bottom edge.  Whether this continues or not may be an issue down the road.  But given the sale price I paid, I'll be happy to get a year or two of wear compared to some of my real leather (and more expensive) belts that last for years."
4.0,I like the quality and how sturdy the charms are. Only thing that I didn't exactly like is the fact that I thought 100g of charms meant 100 charms but I guess I was incorrect and that's fine 80 is plenty enough for the cheap pricing.
4.0,Nice neutral colors.
4.0,"Super cute, perfect for my cosplay. Very soft and a good length. I am 5'6 and around 180-190 pounds, went with a large. I love it. üòä"
4.0,"Love the dress! Got the Army green color. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because I have wider hips for my proportions and don't like side-seam pockets because they kinda stick out, so I plan to sew them closed.  Otherwise the dress is great, soft, feels good on. I'm 4'11"" , 34B bust, 40"" hips, and got a size Small.  If you're taller than me, this will be quite short on you, as it comes to the top part of my knees."
4.0,Comfortable. Love the tie option
4.0,Soft and warm. Hope they wash well. Fit me great at size 16. Bought 2 more pair.
4.0,The shorts fit sort of tight . But Overall Nice Set
4.0,"Nice dress, stretches some for curves. But it had a plastic feel to it and was shorter than expected"
4.0,Great material fits well.I'm 5‚Äô6 and it was a little longer than expected.hung past my knees.but over all great dress
4.0,"I have gotten quite a few similar ear rings like this. You get what you pay for. The set I got is not bad. You do need to be careful with them, just dont man handle them and you should be fine. I suggest cleaning them though before you put them in. I sleep with mine in and they are fine."
4.0,"Loose fitting, which is good because I was afraid of buying clothes online. I am 5-2 and the pant legs go all the way to my ankles. Nice material, hopefully won't wrinkle too bad. Drawback: the crisscross top is wide open, so I will have to add in some snaps to keep it closed. Also, the elastic on the waist band broke and fell apart, so I will have to sew it back on."
4.0,"It's a great color and comfy fabric. But the fabric is clingy and thin enough to see pantylines, the dreaded back-bulge from your bra, and so on. It fit mostly like I expected, but the sleeves were suuuper long. I'm only 5'3, so naturally my arms are on the short side, but these sleeves extended a good 4 or 5 inches past my fingertips."
4.0,"Bought for my husband.  Nice looking mask.  His only complaint is that the nose clip doesn‚Äôt close tight enough to prevent his glasses from fogging up.  Otherwise, good facial coverage and thickness."
4.0,"it's not the best product, but not bad too for the price, liked it and person whom I gifted using it"
4.0,"We are true Patriots fans so I look for products online to show our pride. This hat is nice and warm and showcases a patriots logo, but I just feel like it was somewhat generic."
4.0,"They fit true to size. I kind of wanted them a bit more slim throughout the leg, but that‚Äôs what leggings are for so these did the job just fine."
4.0,"I bought this product needing a toiletry bag that would hang (camping, train travel).  Things I like:  under pocket for small towel and more; the zippers - you can cram that bag until it's bursting at the seams and not have to worry.  Things that irritate me about the bag:  the mesh pockets - small things get stuck in the mesh constantly; the hanger - it's not sewn in but held with velcro so if the bag is heavy the velcro doesn't stick and all your stuff falls out."
4.0,"cute, nice at the beach"
4.0,Son loves Christmas gift
4.0,"Good quality dress, fit as expected. I returned it because the color is somewhat too matte for me. It doesn't have the vibrant purple as shown in the picture."
4.0,"Good basic boot, and the price was right!"
4.0,"Love love love!!! I am thick, & have always admired these high waisted bikinis from afar because of self-esteem...well I finally ordered, & am absolutely in Love! Wasn't crazy about bottoms (because of pattern) so I got some different ones, but the for was spot on, & you can't get much cuter than the top! Absolutely love!"
4.0,Some were different from picture which is the only reason for 4 stars but they all look really nice and at a very good price.
4.0,Love the dress Cut to small
4.0,good product delivered as promised
4.0,"Quality is good, but the fit is a bit tight comparing to the size description."
4.0,It is comfortable. Since I buy it I use it every day just in time for the coming cold weather. It is soft to touch and warm my feet during the day and also when I sleep.
4.0,"I'm a heathy girl , xl  just my size.got my daughter a lrg."
4.0,"Received this free for review. When I ordered it, I was expecting it to be a little more tan, but it ended up being more of a reddish brown color that doesn‚Äôt match any of my shoes‚Ä¶ Bummer."
4.0,Just what I needed. The only reason gave 4 stars was because when trying to put the band around the net it broke. But the others are fine
4.0,"Very cute, elegant and simple. The material is very soft and good quality. I am 5'5"" and 134-135 lb and small size fits perfectly.<br />I removed one star because the neck is slightly wobbly and I feel that the breast area would look better with more space.<br />I bought 2 more different colors :)"
4.0,"The body of this shirt is as expected. The sleeves are, a bit, big and a little longer than expected. It‚Äôs super cute though & I would buy again!"
4.0,I bought these shoes for my granddaughter who is two years old. They appear to be comfortable to her she wore them all day and didn't want to take them off. She was able to put them on by herself and I like that they have a wide sole for stability with nice rubber  bottoms for good traction. I would rate them higher but we've only had them a few days.
4.0,"These lenses work well on my spectacles.  Just be sure to measure your glasses carefully to get a size that will cover your lenses.  As you can see from the photo, I should have ordered a wider lens, but I can't see the gap when I have them on anyway.  Didn't give them 5 stars because the crossbar is rather fragile where it attaches to the lens frames, and I'm afraid it may break off the frame sooner than later."
4.0,Nice items and good quality.
4.0,"Beautiful top that fits great, but bottoms are way too small. Gave them to my little sister."
4.0,This item was a gift.  The person receiving them was very excited to have a variety of colors to wear.  They are nicely shaped and comfortable for wearing
4.0,I love the purse just wish there were a few more pockets. Also maybe a strap for over the shoulder.
4.0,"This bag is pretty skinny, so be warned it will not act as a purse.<br /><br />However that is not what I was expecting anyways. This is a beautifully colored product and is much prettier than in the picture.<br /><br />Although it is worth its cost, the zipper is hard to close because the ends are not sewed together. If you look closely at the picture, the zipper sticks up instead of being embedded in the bag, and the ends are not sewn. All you must do is sew a few stitched to close it and it works like a charm. I am reluctant to buy products with no reviews, but this was a good purchase."
4.0,They hide perfect as no show socks but the heel kept riding down a bit on one of them. Overall good buy
4.0,"purchased this for my wife, she already used and is very happy with it."
4.0,"They came tangled in the box, but they were easy to untangle. Cute for the price."
4.0,"nice, not very many credit card slots, the zippered coin part is extremely small and basically useless<br />but nice quality"
4.0,Great sweater!  Looks fantastic on! Fits as stated on size chart. Sweater is really nice but only complaint is weird fabric odor.<br />But Have not laundered yet.
4.0,A little big but very comfy
4.0,Fit well. Great price
4.0,"These boots fit very comfortable and are true to size.<br />My only issue is with the zipper, which has a tendency to get stuck on the inner facing of the boot."
4.0,I love the earrings but the clip at the back was delivered broken<br />Costing was too much to return.<br />But it's a beautiful pair of earrings I also got the pearl.
4.0,"Very pretty, a good deal for the price."
4.0,Pretty large as and long. So if ur not feeling how short swim trunks are coming these are for you. Great color. Wore for two summers and holding up fine. They just run big.
4.0,Liked!üëçcute shirt - lots of compliments
4.0,I like you. Im wondering how soon before it chances color tho.
4.0,"Purchased for the groomsmen. They actually wore them for our outside ceremony which was a total shock when I walked down the aisle and saw them. Wasn‚Äôt planned at all, was just one of their gifts.  My husband removed his shades the moment I stepped out. The photos look GREAT!"
4.0,cute and comfortable great value! looks cute on! washes well!
4.0,Cool looking glasses arrived quickly. These are a pretty dead on replica as the ones worn in the Iron man movie. The quality isn‚Äôt the greatest but the look is there
4.0,Cute top!  The fabric was much nicer than I expected.  It's too short for me to be comfortable in as a dress but really cute with tights and boots (which is how I intended to wear it).  The color and pattern is beautiful!  I haven't washed it yet to see how it holds up that's the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars.
4.0,Sturdy rubber soles! Great quality for the price
4.0,True fashion statement. Fit as expected. True to size.
4.0,"I've had bands break, and the casing of my old Fitbit fail. This one works perfectly.  Only slight downside is that you have to work a bit to get the charger to fit correctly to charge, but that's not an issue considering the benefits of the protection it gives.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for those active Fitbit users"
4.0,"I really like my new Kimono, very vibrant colors.  The only dislike I have is that the description stated it is Chiffon, which I thought was a soft thin material.  This is kind of stiff and scratchy.  Maybe  I will try putting it in the dyrer with a dryer sheet to see if it softens it up a bit.  Otherwise overall satisfied."
4.0,I ordered these for running to provide calf compression. They came in a 3 pack of fun color or print combinations. These have decent compression for typical use but I will use more technical options for an injury or race.
4.0,Love it for some reason it makes me look like a have a really tiny waist! Yay
4.0,ok for the price and the shipping took a long time
4.0,Fits smaller than expected. Especially the top.
4.0,The item fit perfect but irritated my skin around my elbows.  It still was a wonderful fit.
4.0,"The sides, under the arms came WAY to far down (it came under my bra band) so I wear a shirt under it but it's still super cute!"
4.0,I really like these Handkerchiefs.  I washed them prior to use to soften them.
4.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  They fit perfectly and seem to be very good quality.
4.0,"These are pretty nice. The only complaint I have is that when my husband went to take it off, it has a wire that snagged it & messed up his tie. It's right above your thumb when pressing, it's the spring pulled up connecting the upper bar, but as long as you pay attention & go slow when taking it off, it'll be fine. I have some jewelers files that I'm gonna try & file it down. We are still happy with my purchase & would buy again."
4.0,"My husband absolutely loves his new boots. He works outside and is on his feet a lot.. But I wish I could contact the company and tell them that only after a week of wearing them, the shoelaces broke! Such a high quality shoe should also have high quality shoelaces! He had to take his old ones off of his old boots to make it work today! Gdefy, please send us better shoelaces!"
4.0,"These shorts fit small, they are not a &#34;true&#34; 8.  But they are cute."
4.0,"This is a cute top, but it's a tad sheer for my liking, which I wasn't really expecting.<br />Still a good buy, but be warned."
4.0,"Like the fit, comfortable for work but a little short for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and long legged"
4.0,"The good:  These slippers are good for around the house.  They stay on your feet so you aren't having to scuff your feet to keep them on, and they don't have the annoying moccasin leather ties on top that ALWAYS come undone and serve no purpose but to annoy.  They are true to size. The rubber soles curve up around the sides enough to make them effective at keeping out moisture, and they are warm.<br />The not-so-good:  I have to chuckle when I remember reading about the gentleman who said he wears these to the store.  I wouldn't dare.  This is hard to explain, but there seems to be more leather around the toe area than is needed, which gives the slippers a funny look -- like elf or leprechaun shoes. In Maine, it is customary to bring slippers to friends' homes because you remove your wet, snowy shoes at the door.  When I broke these slippers out, we had a good chuckle with our friends.  I am not the only  one who thinks they look goofy."
4.0,"Fit my 7 year son pretty well , he‚Äôll be able to grow into it !"
4.0,"They fit. The jury is still out for how durable they are. The last time I bought shorts from Amazon the pockets tore the first time I washed them. These so far have held up - I've washed them twice. I don't like the belt because it's a pain in the backside to remove but other than that, so far so good."
4.0,all good. nice & snug . stitching feels quality
4.0,I bought these for riding my motorcycle and they work for that.
4.0,I like this a lot! However it does run a little small. I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a XLarge and I‚Äôm glad I did.  It‚Äôs very nice and soft and a  perfect length. It is also the perfect weight for me as I am always hot so it nice to have a lightweight sweater to wear.
4.0,"It's a heavier cloth like material, but still cute. It's very long, even when pulled up under my bossom. Overall nice."
4.0,"This is a real secure fit bra, the jade green is vibrant and looks like the picture"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good gym hoodie. Not usually a fan of the ‚Äúbasketball jersey‚Äù material, but these work. A little on the longer side, but being tall, it‚Äôs a welcome change.<br /><br />Would recommend."
4.0,Good product for a very cheap price. I like the brown bands with a blue face. It comes with a nice box.
4.0,"Bought the shirt for myself to go with the 2 tee shirts I bought for my brothers that read &#34; Worlds Okayest Brother&#34; . Made for a great photo op!<br />I believe this was described as a woman's fitted tee, so I should have expected it to fit snug, but it did fit! Nice quality, didn't lose shape or color after first washing."
4.0,The cotton on the inside is comfortable and you can insert a filter. The outside is smooth and seems synthetic and the colors are nice. The adjustable ear loops are great. There‚Äôs an extra flap of fabric that goes over your nose which is nice if you have glasses. My big objection is the wire on the inside is so flimsy it‚Äôs like a twist tie for a bag of bread. After washing the masks the wires move away from the nose bridge and it‚Äôs hard to move them back to the middle because they start to poke through the fabric. I had to cut the wire out.
4.0,Super super cute. Really well made. The shoes were a little off looking and didnt use them.
4.0,I love the pendant but the black rope it came on is useless so I replaced with silver chain and it looks nice.  My son loves it!
4.0,Definitely not the color Frame or lenses I thought I was buying but overall great glasses
4.0,"It was great, but I had problems with the connecter piece. The chain was better then the copper one I had put on it when I got it. But I had to use a pair of pliers to keep the cross from falling wherever I was. Eventually I welded it together."
4.0,"I love the color the feel the warmth inside the glove. The touch screen but for me the fit was a little off. I usually wear a large. Ring size  7,  and the glove is a little tight and the fingers a little long but I‚Äôm keeping them. I think if they were extra large they would be to large.  Hopefully the will stretch."
4.0,I ordered the shoe cause I had foot surgery and it‚Äôs too tight to wear. I‚Äôm considering returning it
4.0,Exactly as described! My new favorite go-to earring.
4.0,Good fit...ordered large for layering. Thumb holes are the best selling feature. Great for outdoor experiences.
4.0,I love it! It's long enough to cover everything I needed it to. And usually I hate pink but not this time. If I had to give one complaint it would that it didn't say anything about padding in the chest area but it has it.
4.0,Very happy with this item so far.  Minor issue with the lens breaking/popping out of frame.  But no scratches occurred when fixing product.
4.0,"Normal t-shirt material, just longer. I got a XL, but could have probably gone for L, I just wanted to make sure it was long enough as I am using it as a slip. The material, as stated is normal t-shirt material, but with that, is quality material that isn't to thin. I am using it as a slip to go under a lace, see-threw dress, and have a feeling that it will work nicely."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, just a little too big. I usually get a med/lg because of my frame."
4.0,"I do like this top and the quality of the shirt is actually pretty nice, not cheap or thin feeling.  However, there are some things to mention:<br />a) the shirt does not come down as far on the front and rear and does fit that loose<br />b) the sleeves are not rolled as pictured<br />c) only comes in one size and if you're a size med, large, XL or up, this will likely not fit as well<br />d) it looks HUGE on the model, but fits me nicely<br /><br />The shirt represented on the model is not exactly what you'll receive, but it's cute and different and for the price I will be keeping it."
4.0,It was good once I got it
4.0,This swim suit seems really well build. The only thing I didn't like was that it seemed a bit short overall which wasn't bad for me because I have a short torso. It also seemed to have a really sturdy top which is important.
4.0,"Beautiful, fits wonderfully and so comfortable! Didn't give 5 stars because the pockets (which was the major selling point) ripped as soon as I put my hand in. üòì<br />Nothing a needle and some thread can't fix!"
4.0,Too large.  I'll try to make some adjustments and home I can alternate it so I can wear it.
4.0,This is my second set. First lasted for several years before the lenses started deteriorating. Only complaint is the nose pads pop off easily.
4.0,"This is the 6th of  these dresses I have purchased (solid green, burgundy, black, blue/green monstera print, blue white print and blue floral print). I have found them to be comfy and they wash well, though the printed versions get a little pilly after 8 - 10 washes. Going to take my little sweater shaver to them to reduce that.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"" and they hit me right at or just below the knee (varies based on print). The cross over bust is pretty wide, so I pin or tack them closed higher up so I'm not sporting too much cleavage.<br /><br />If there were more printed versions I liked, I would buy them too!"
4.0,"I like the olive green color and the length. It's nice and warm to throw on, rather than a heavy jacket. It's perfect for the in between when it's not cold enough for the very warm down jacket and too cold for the wind breaker. I've gotten compliments on it."
4.0,I love my band but it does run alittle smaller than I expected but still very comfortable...
4.0,I like this blouse. Very comfortable to wear.
4.0,I know that Mordenmiss is designed for much smaller women than myself -- but at 5'5&#34; muscular size 12/14 most of their stuff looks really nice --- and I have a big chest. I highly recommend buying a few pieces and trying them out.  You can always send back if it doesn't work. I wore this with jeans and ankle boots. Got A LOT of compliments.
4.0,Perfect size for my party favor
4.0,"Although I had to straighten out the hemline, since I do not like high-low skirts, I really like this dress, especially with a long sleeve shirt on underneath."
4.0,"Love these leggings. I work out a lot, so I always need new things to wear. I bought the small and they fit as expected. I only gave these 4 stars because I feel the stitching can be improved a bit. They fit great though and I like the style a lot. If they would improve the thread in the stitching a bit, then these would be 5+ stars for me."
4.0,"Lovely shoes, but seem higher than they appear in the picture.  Very nice, though!"
4.0,"It holds tightly & is very secure. You can hardly see it through your clothes. It doesn't really cover my full abdomen area, but it got pretty close. I worked out in it, and I did sweat a lot more in these! It's good for helping your posture as well. Good buy overall."
4.0,"This one fits exactly as you'd exect and the quality is pretty good.  I think if you like the style and price you will be happy with this one...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,"Works well for the price, my daughter has had no complaints."
4.0,"I have Purchased Several Pairs (at Least 5 pairs ) Within 1 year.. I have ordered 2 pairs in the last 3 months That are simply TOO TIGHT In The CLAVES ? THE FIRST ONE I ASSUMED I GOT A PAIR THAT WASN'T MADE CORRECTLY ? HOWEVER, I RE-ORDERED TO SEE IF THIS PAIR WOULD FIT AS THE ""OTHER ONES HAD "" I AM SAD TO SAY THIS PAIR IS AS TIGHT AS THE ONES I JUST BOUGHT ? I EVEN TRIED DIFFERENT COLORS. COLOR DIDN'T MATTERED ?"
4.0,I absolutely love this skirt and have received so many compliments.  The material is NOT thin like one would expect.  Stitching is good.  Vibrant colors and looks as it did online.  This was my first purchase from Annflat but it will NOT be my last.
4.0,"It is a soft swimsuit-like material, but it's not see through and it is very comfortable. I did find it strange that the color/design is only on the front. The back is solid black. But it fits well, even if its not as loose and flowy as I prefer. Mine is too short to pair with leggings, but it covers my tummy well."
4.0,This long sleeve cardigan is of beautiful material. Looks and fits nicely. Good to wear with either a blouse underneath or a short sleeve shirt. Fits perfectly.
4.0,Very cute design but somewhat larger than I expected. They stay on your ear and don't fall upside down if you close them tight enough.
4.0,The fabric is good quality and I was paid impressed with the print is better than what I was expecting
4.0,"Cute for the price but it's just legging style material cut into strips. There's no hemming sewn to seal the ... well, duh, the hem. So it's kinda cheaply made, but also cheap to buy. My 2yr old neice loves to put headbands around her neck like an infinity scarf so it'll do the trick for a gift!"
4.0,Seems to run just a tad small but still fit
4.0,"These hats are really nice quality and seem warm. However, despite stating they are 0months to 36months they are closer to the 36months size and our baby won't fit into them anytime soon. But because they do look really nice and appear warm and comfy we will be using them in the future when he gets bigger."
4.0,"The color of these pants was off, the brown has a purple/wine tinge. Good quality fabric and good otherwise"
4.0,Love this dress and got lots of compliments... my only gripe is that the thread in the area under rhe armpits has unraveled on both sides after washing so I will have to sew that
4.0,These are very nice and go with a lot of my tops. Comfortable to wear.
4.0,I love love love these! Disappointed that they're too big though and don't know how I'm supposed to return them to get the right size. The material is really nice and stretchy though and the pocket is awesome.
4.0,Cheap and functional.
4.0,"On time, material is thick like banquet table cloth. My daughter loves it. Trump looking patch is funny."
4.0,"Super durable and well-made. Cushy, but not too thick. A pleasure to run in!<br />(Disclaimer: This product was purchased at a discounted price for the purpose of review.)"
4.0,"Hi-Tie men classics tie, handkerchief, and cufflinks.<br />Love the tie and the kerchief. The Catholics would‚Äôve been great except they were damaged, smashed so they can‚Äôt be worn.  Can I get another pair?<br />Please text me so we can get this resolved.<br />mercybelle@yahoo.com<br />Thank you so much.<br />Michelle"
4.0,Did not receive the correct shoes.  I ordered an olive green vintage style and received a brown pair of loafers.  I don‚Äôt hate them but also don‚Äôt like them as much as the ones I ordered.  I won‚Äôt reorder out of fear I will receive another pair of loafers.  Gsve 4 stars since the size is correct and they could be worse.  It‚Äôs a glass half full type of day.
4.0,"These are great & do the job perfectly for driving.  So, if you don‚Äôt want to buy a prescription set of sunglasses for driving or watching sports outdoors‚Ä¶ These are a great solution. The durable, easy to use & something that never needs to be worried about. Also, my glasses are on the large size. They clearly function w/ any sized glasses-"
4.0,"I absolutely loved this coat! I am a size 36 chest and it came nowhere near fitting me...couldn‚Äôt even dream of buttoning it. It was a wonderfully made jacket , however and if they had had it in a larger size I would have just exchanged it. They didn‚Äôt so I had to go with a different company. The return process was simple and hassle free. I would definitely consider buying in a larger size at a later date."
4.0,"I am 5'6ish and just under 200lbs. I have a bust of 38DDD. I absolutely loved this dress, it's super sexy and flattering! I ordered an XL and the waist of the dress was actually a little loose and its definitely short, but it's okay. Unfortunately the material for your tata's is way too small. My erasers were almost popping out without any movement. hahah I paired it with a lacy black bando and that still didn't fully correct the problem! If you have smaller tata's give this a try, it's fantastic!"
4.0,Nice product. Only complaint is the material doesn‚Äôt hold on any heat so after a while you get cold
4.0,"TThe top w bail came apart as I unwrapped it,and is easily  fixable w superglue. The stone is a good length for a petite woman,and very strong,it feels good to wear. I do not trust longer ones  I I pu w crystals,as the Crystal usually cracks. This is simple,and strong. Also,I like the idea that all of their pieces are blessed. The world is losing his getting more and more dangerous. Take any blessing that comes your way!!!!!!"
4.0,It was a nice fit the sizes are a true fit
4.0,Cute swim suit a little tight but it‚Äôs cute
4.0,"Best no-show socks I‚Äôve tried! They truly don‚Äôt show. Sometimes by the end of the day, they slip off my heel, which is a little annoying, but for me they still rate above others."
4.0,"Great size! I highly recommend, for those who do not like to carry purses."
4.0,Runs slightly small
4.0,"I had surgery and spent time in bed.  This is warm, no zippers, no buttons."
4.0,"Quality wasn't what I expected, but it came quickly and had a free gift!"
4.0,"Very cute casual shirt but runs very small. If you want it to fit like it does in the picture, I‚Äôd suggest ordering at least one size up."
4.0,"Wish the sizes came in half sizes, but other than that it's a great sandal."
4.0,My daughter loves this umbrella.  It's super cute and came with some fake petals. She's only had to use it once but she couldn't wait to use it.
4.0,Great and the dress is beautiful but see through
4.0,I like this hoody that I got.  However it is not really what I was expecting.  I thought that it would be more like and actual hoody and have a don't know what you call it but a I guess binder on the bottom.  You know a strip of material that helps keep the hoody snug around your body.  This hoody did not have that.  Also this hoody was just a little lighter weight then I expected.  I still like it though and it goes great with yoga pants.
4.0,Love this dress....get many compliments
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty. I have large stretched ear lobes that I wear a pair of black rose acrylic plugs in. I was looking for a matching pendant when I came upon this. With my birthday right around the corner I decided to order.<br /><br />The pendant itself is perfect. It appears to be made of good solid Pewter with an acrylic black rose. With that said, it isn‚Äôt perfect.<br /><br />The necklace has what appears to be a sterling - or sterling looking - bale and necklace. The necklace appears to be about 18‚Äù long, which is too short for my preferences. I would also have preferred a stainless steel or matching pewter bale to prevent any tarnishing or allergic reaction. I did make the decision to change both the bale and the necklace chain - keep that in mind when looking at my photo.<br /><br />With that said, I believe it is decently priced, but had I known I would be replacing the bale and chain I would have saved the $5 and ordered it from the cheapest vendor instead of on Prime (non-Prime was cheaper)."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. He was having aching feet at a new job. When he wore them for about 3 days, he said they helped a little with achy feet but he really likes that they don't fall down when moving around and keeps his boots from digging in his ankles and legs."
4.0,"Love this dress, very flattering. The only down fall is the thin straps so difficult to wear a bra with"
4.0,This works really well and is pretty comfortable to use. The only downside is the head is a bit loose and will fall off so you need to super glue it in place.
4.0,Leather is very stiff but is exactly what I needed
4.0,The slippers are very comfortable but if you wear a size 12 get the 13 still my toe is near the end
4.0,Very casual.  VERY comfortable.  Price is right.
4.0,It's a good quality dress but a little too short. I'm 5' tall and I thought this was too short.
4.0,"I love the style if this dress, I have the black one, the pink is very light so it's kind if see through so have to be careful. But they are very comfy dresses!"
4.0,Great gift.  I only have one issue n it was totally my fault.  It is small then what I wanted.  I always go over reviews n guess I had a blank moment.  Everything else was perfect. Fast delivery n package great
4.0,"Very nice quality, the sweater is really soft!  I got a medium and I am 5'10 and feel like they are a little longer than I like. They would definitely match better with pants or outfits worn at a lower waist line."
4.0,"I bought this for a wedding. I decided to wear a different dress but it fit just as expected. I will say that it is a very showing in the front .. especially for women with larger breasts like myself. However, nothing that a few safety pins can't help with."
4.0,Pretty as pictured but small for my wrist with no give.
4.0,It‚Äôs a super light weight boot. I ordered my actual shoe size and it was a little roomy. A do-over and I would size down. It completely depends on if you like a true fit of a little snug however.
4.0,A little short on the wrists and a little tight moving my arms.
4.0,Not as fluffy as I expected
4.0,My daughter wears 7-8 in US size so I ordered an 8. It's too big on her so she won't be able to wear them on her Halloween bday.  We have to wait until she could fit into them now but it is better big than small. ‚ò∫
4.0,"I am keeping this bra because it fits pretty well, but the fabric is quite rough, and is itchy."
4.0,"My daughter loved this but unfortunately it ran small and doesn‚Äôt seem to have an much stretch as a leotard should so we returned it, I definitely recommend sizing up!"
4.0,"The size I ordered was too tight for my upper legs BUT i found an excellent use for them anyway -- I have arthritis all through my body, including my elbows, so that's where I am currently wearing them when my elbows begin to ache.  They are tight enough to stay in place on my arms."
4.0,"The dress is attractive and flattering for pear shapes. Unfortunately the zipper is terrible quality and I could barely zip it up and down. I took it to the tailor to replace the zipper and take it in on the top, since the underarm area was gaping (as other reviewers also mentioned). If you are slim in the upper body or have a small chest, this would probably not be a great fit. For reference, I am 5'3&#34; and 130 lbs."
4.0,Had to remove the belt at the airport. It set off TSA sensor.  Good day to day belt anyway.
4.0,very nice Iike it
4.0,Not the usual quality but good glasses for price
4.0,"TL;DR: Fine for wearing around but durability is questionable.<br /><br />I received these as part of the vine program, and at first I was pleasantly surprised by their size and vibrant coloring. I thought for sure they would differ from the online photos but I was pleasantly surprised. Then I removed the stack from the plastic and held one up. You don't even have to hold it up to the light, if you hold it at arms' length and look at it straight on you can see right through it. Initially I planned on using them to patch holes in my jeans so I could still use them as work jeans (automotive work can destroy everyday clothing). After evaluating these, I'm skeptical that would work very well. At first, sure, but I don't think they would hold up to the abuse I had initially planned on putting them through.<br /><br />If you wanted to use these as a fashion accessory they would be a great option. As I said earlier, the colors are vibrant and the patterns are crisp. If you wanted to rep a particular color I'd say these are a decent consideration. Due to their thinness they are light and breathe well - an important feature if you're wearing one on your head. The size is decently large enough to allow for that too - I've had small bandanna's in the past with limited usage due to their small footprint and didn't care for them. These are large enough to do most of the common things people use them for. I would say these would be perfect, actually, for just about everything - except for use as a patch or rag. The holding power and durability are likely poor due to the lanky nature of their construction."
4.0,"Internet research:<br /><br />""33cm high and expand to approximately 15cm and are 33cm wide""<br /><br />as well as this:<br /><br />""Fabric: 600D polyester with PVC backing Dimensions: 26cm (W) x 33cm (H) x 17cm (D) Drop in top zip"""
4.0,A little cheap. They seem like they don't lay right on the face.
4.0,Would like t be a bit longer. But I love them and s do the people that bought them.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,These are really pretty!  Looking forward to wearing them - I did notice that one of the gems were missing but luckily it was in the container and I just glued it on..
4.0,Nice belt and quality. I bought the smaller sized belt and it was very big. I had to punch an additional hole in the belt. This worked out great. However the  rest of the belt wraps completely around my waist and just hangs there. I have a 26 1/2 inch waist.
4.0,Love the outfit! It‚Äôs stretchy I haven‚Äôt worn it but I tried it on and it‚Äôs fine! My pants are kind of too high for my liking I will alter them but overall great outfit!
4.0,I love the dress.  The quality of material is nice.  It is nice sized as expected but I would get a smaller size to wear.
4.0,Would have been nice if it was a little more true to size. However I love the style.
4.0,The color is very much like the picture.
4.0,This is a great summer dress and fits perfectly on me.  I am small chested and bought medium so for larger chested girls that area might be tight. Got the yellow (warning yellow is very vivid and bright as pictured) but toned down with denim jacket over and got tons of compliments!
4.0,"True to size, not too see thru for a white shirt, and seems to wash up well. Worth the price"
4.0,"The material is thin, but it does a decent job with the bounce. I've spent  far more on bras that aren't as good."
4.0,My child is a 0 in size and this fit her great to wear for a Halloween party at the rescue squad. She loves it and worn it for 2 years straight.
4.0,"Satisfecho, se nota algo fr√°gil. Pero cumple."
4.0,Neck opening is kind of small
4.0,I like the design and the material but the top is really short at lest for me and I'm regular size.
4.0,These were absolutely adorable beanies BUT I washed and dried them before baby came and the glue melted and the beanie started falling apart before I ever used it. Thankfully I ended up having a boy and didn't need them but I definitely recommend hang drying these if you get them.
4.0,"Cute, fun, fits well. 1 star off for squirm factor... It constantly shifts off center in the boob area."
4.0,Could have come with a nicer chain  but a lovely pendant.
4.0,"I bought this to cosplay Mary from Kagerou project. It arrived very fast thanks to prime. Anyway the overall dress is very cute, both with and without the apron and I'd totally wear the dress without the apron for everyday use. However the dress was very tight on me, and I'm only 5 ft 4 and around 123 lbs so I wouldn't say I'm that big. It does have a zipper on it which is nice of course, but I still had to put it over my head to fit it. Also the apron is a little tricky to put on since the string cross in the back. But overall very cute, nice fabric and perfect for what I wanted it for though I might need to lose like 15-20 pounds to actually fit comfortably(just kidding) but still very small."
4.0,I love wearing this bracelet! I rated this four stars since one of the circle things towards the end fell off though I really cannot complain. So far I have been wearing this everyday!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:9fc6b693551cfdaeb9b1af9c0d02c1f1]] black is faded
4.0,"I found the Copper Compression Mask to be substantial, comfortable, and well fitting.  It is easy to adjust the fit with the adjustable ear loops, and the copper provides you with extra protection.  Copper apparently adds some antimicrobial benefit.<br />The reason I rated the mask with only four stars is because this mask is not machine washable.  It must be washed by hand with distilled or purified water to protect the copper. The manufacturer does not recommend using a soap product. I feel that I cannot get the mask cleaned properly with only a rinse in purified water."
4.0,"It is very cool, but I can hardly fit anything in it. It is very bulky."
4.0,I liked this product. it worked great. my only advice to people purchansing the item is that the laces are actually a bit short.<br />I was able to use them for a walking event - but i would not have been able to use them for a running event.
4.0,Good quality overall. Money holder is not too strong though.
4.0,Bought for my mom for mother's day and she loved it. Elegant and sentimental
4.0,"I was impressed by the quality of this customer. It looks just as pictured. I'm 5'8, 200lb, athletic build and it fits a little tight around the chest area. I usually wear a Large but decided to go with an XL, which again, is tight in the chest, but I'm not surprised considering this ships from China. I almost feel like I should have gotten the 2XL, but I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it. Overall, it is a great quality costume, so you get what you pay for. It's a 4 piece costume, the top, the pants, white silk gloves that stretch and the neck ruffle. The pants are stretchy like jogging pants and there is a zipper on the side of the jacket. This is without a doubt the best looking Pennywise costume on Amazon."
4.0,Really like the style and it fits well except for skirt length.<br />I will need about 10&#34; cut off.... I am petite size and stand 5' tall.  Easy to cut off hem length.  Will be great for beach in Mexico!
4.0,"I read other reviews saying the top ran small so I ordered 3x larger than my normal size. The top JUST fits.  Buyers, order larger than you think you'll need.  it is a pretty top."
4.0,"This product arrives in a very generic box, which is expected for the price. The quality of the item appears to be good. Both watch faces are working and all pieces are easy to switch out. The watch face is easy to take in and out of the watch cover yet it still feels secure when worn. I do wish there was a purchase option for gender neutral colors.<br /><br />This item is cheap enough to count as a holiday stocking stuffer, but also has a high enough quality to be a great gift used in a holiday exchange."
4.0,"Clasp broke, but I repaired.  I enjoy wearing it."
4.0,The pink is darker than shown here but still a pretty solitaire pendant
4.0,Works great but color gradually goes away around edges revealing a dark gray.
4.0,Love the pattern and the cut of this dress. Adorable for work or and evening out :)
4.0,"This bag is adorable and the perfect size for me! Not too big that it looks funny like I'm carrying an overnight bag day to day. But big enough to store all my things! I was in need of something with longer straps for the winter to fit over a bulky coat and this fit wonderfully! The exterior of The purse has held up Great with no signs of wear.  The cons...the cute tassle tends to try and fall off, luckily I have always caught it before I lost it. There are little rings around the straps where the straps meet the bag and they do not stay put. Not a huge deal. After using it for one season one of the little pockets inside came unstitched on the bottom so it no longer keeps things in it."
4.0,"So far so good, very cute and looks just lie the picture.  Needs to loosen up a bit.  Pretty stiff still."
4.0,Cute but I can't load up a lot of things in here cuz the straps might snap
4.0,The dress is really pretty but it has an awkward length soo I'm gonna get it cut
4.0,"I got the medium. I am 5'2, about 120 lbs.  The bikini top fit a bit small/snug (I have a small chest) but wearable, the bottoms were great, the pink overtop was a bit big but I think it will work fine. All appears to be good quality (not super thin material)."
4.0,"This wallet feels like its going to last a long time. Good sturdy fabric on the outside and all of the stitching looks good. The only downside is not a single debit or credit card of mine fits into the allotted slots. The slots are just a hair short and I don't want to risk stretching of tearing the fabric. The slot for the ID card seems the right size, as I was able to get my ID in there with no issues."
4.0,Attractive and well made
4.0,"A little large for petite girl, but most are."
4.0,way too few color options in the XL deaprtment
4.0,I purchased this to wear as a wrap over a gown. It is just what I wanted. Simple and lovely.
4.0,Very cute but looks nothing like pic I kept it cause it's cute but the material does not look like that it's cotton and the dots are not that small
4.0,"Got them for my son for Christmas, he is on the laptop a lot and asked for them to help his eye strain. üëç"
4.0,"These neoprene water shoes have textured rubber soles that provide good traction for little ones.<br /><br />They let water through while protecting little feet from rocks and scratchy surfaces.<br /><br />They will prevent scrapes, splinters, and scratches, but the sole is too thin to stop a jagged piece of glass or a sharp nail.<br /><br />They work great as water shoes, but they are two tiny pieces of neoprene, very expensive for the materials used."
4.0,I have yet to try them on - but they look ample enuff and sturdy enuff - thank you !!
4.0,"Well, this a pleasure. My necklace arrived in two days and I was sooo delighted because it is so much nicer in person. I wasn't sure looking at the<br />photo, which is far from flattering to say the least, that I was going to give it as a gift. Well, not to worry, this delicate vision of loveliness is going to<br />get you major brownie points. I must remind you that a 1mm chain is about as thin as you can get and as such would not be suitable for younger<br />ages unless they are the very careful kind that you know you can trust to take care. I took off a star for the ring clasp, which does not do justice<br />to such a nice piece of jewelry. Personally, I will take it to my jeweler and have it replaced with a tiny little lobster clasp. Another consideration<br />would be to replace the chain with a 2mm chain which no doubt will come with a lobster claw clasp already. It includes helpful hints and it comes<br />in a very nice box with card. All told, a very classy act. It is bigger than I was expecting, good, right? And it is 3 dimensional, not flat on the back."
4.0,Customer should order one size larger for good fit
4.0,I brought this dress as a gift. It fits just right.
4.0,"Weird but yes, a snowman can be sexy and if thats what you want, look no further."
4.0,The length is great! It reaches my knees & doesn‚Äôt dig into my thigh. The front is good & high but comes down on sides. The back is low & the one bad part. When I bend down or over I have to keep pulling them up. If they were the same height all the way around they would be a 5 star. Almost rated 3 star because when the back goes down you can see my butt crack‚òπÔ∏è.
4.0,"It's not quite as oversized as the picture would have you believe.  However, it is a loose fit and refreshing to finally have bought the correct size without having it be too clingy."
4.0,Just received this so I cannot speak to longevity- but I am pleasantly surprised. True to size. Bright and comfortable. Flattering fit.<br />I would like it better with gray shorts instead of black.
4.0,"I love, love, love these earrings. I have the chain to match and they are perfect. Good buy for the price."
4.0,"Thinner than expected,  but that's ok with me. It's really cute."
4.0,"Great gift, wear well and look nice"
4.0,"The necklace hung a little awkward but I think that was because of the dress, not 100% sure my will be wearing again tomorrow with another outfit. Nonetheless I liked it and will purchase more from this company."
4.0,Roomy lightweight and warm
4.0,I got the jade green since it was cheaper-- unfortunately it is much lighter than the photo-- more like a sea foam green.  But I appreciate the length (I hate when capris ride up to my knees) as I'm tall!  Good value for $10.
4.0,"was a gift, they liked it very much. Well made, nice weight."
4.0,"no problems, good value"
4.0,"I am 5' 7&#34; about 195 lbs, average build with my weight pretty much everywhere but a decent portion in the tummy. Normally I am between a large and x-large so I order the 14, assumed it would be a tad tight. To my surprise it is not! It is actually a little loose but not sure if I want to chance a size down. I normally dislike dresses on me because they accentuate my midsection which I feel them makes me look like cow since I also have broad shoulders. This is a very pretty and detailed dress. It does have some odd pucker/bunching in the back which might be because it is a little loose? I tried it with a white bra and it did show through but not obscenely, almost looks like an intended underlay.<br /><br />I gave four stars because of the slight bunching or whatever is going on and because I am afraid of catching things on the lace bit. My ring almost got caught in it. Overall I like it, just not sure if the looseness and bunching will fly."
4.0,Beautiful dress but a little see through. I definitely have to wear spandex.
4.0,Case of the glasses it's not closing probable
4.0,I purchased these to see if they might help to eliminate foot swelling after 3 hours in an airplane.  I used them 10 days ago and I think they actually helped.  Looking forward to the return trip to confirm it.
4.0,Is nuse
4.0,"Great dress, a little different than I normally wear. It is a cool dress."
4.0,Good quality.. material was nice. But it was very big. Medium usually fits me good but it fit like a large. I can wear it with jeans and tie it and looks fine...
4.0,Nice jeans just narrow legs and somewhat short length
4.0,"Mine just arrived. I'm 5'3&#34; 190 with Celiac and Crohns, and I carry ALL my weight in my belly. I ordered a 2X and it looks the same as the picture. I pulled up the roll created by my csection and pulled down to the scar it comes to just above where a natural waistline would be. I'm wearing it right away because I'm eager to see results! I will update periodically."
4.0,"Super cute dress, nice fabric and has pockets. I‚Äôm shorter so it‚Äôs a tad longer that I‚Äôd normally like, but its still a cute dress for multiple occasions"
4.0,"Decent and cute. Not as well made as the more expensive brands, so you get what you paid for. But works for my 10 yr old."
4.0,"Great head scarf to sleep in.... Only wish the ties were a little longer to comfortably tie in back, other than that great purchase."
4.0,"Very well built, excellent craftsmanship, very confortable. The color, though, is a little more yellowish than I thought."
4.0,The dresses were pretty and good enough quality. However they fit my bridesmaids a little big they are all between 4'9&#34; and 5'2&#34; so we had to have them altered but the prices they were sold at definitely kept me within budget.
4.0,it's cute... it broke already inside but still holds the cards
4.0,I read a lot of reviews and everyone complained about them being too small. The consensus was they would have bought the next size up or even two sizes up. I'm pretty much a medium in everything but I really liked the color variation and as always worried about the fit so I went large. I have a long torso and small bust these are long on me and baggy should have gone medium.
4.0,Nice gloves but they run small - too tight for my hands. The lining tries to turn inside-out when I take them off.
4.0,The shine is not what I expected.
4.0,Got an XL & I would say it's more like a large.
4.0,I purchased this item for my elderly neighbor.  At present her feet are swollen but the shoes were a welcomed gift.
4.0,My new favorite brand for workout clothes! It offers good quality for its price. Starting with the appearance which originally I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like but after putting the shirts I really enjoy wearing them and would recommend these to all of my friends.
4.0,"It is most certainly comfortable, since I wanted comfort more than anything else, it is loose, but not so large for my size that it looks like a tent.  Not see through and not so thick it's hot either.  It is longer than most, covers a tummy quite well.  Great value for the few dollars spent.  I would say it is probably three seasons worthy and I live in central valley of California where it's already nearing the 100 degree mark, so it's stored until October."
4.0,"These are nice pants, positives include<br />-rich black color<br />-animal hair and lint don't cling<br />-they don't do that overtight weird ripple thing that jeggings are prone to. They fit really smooth and sleek without being too shiny.<br /><br />I didn't like the rise, it is a wee bit high for me but that's a personal preference. I'm a size 8 and thought a medium was a little tight in the waist, going to exchange for a large."
4.0,"Took a little time to receive my pants, but overall, I'm satisfied with the quality and would recommend this item."
4.0,"I really like this purse.  It is more of,  a gold than what I view as Kachi.  It holds all my misc. stuff, but I wish the outside rather than the inside zipper opening had the inside zipper pocket."
4.0,They are doing the job. Not meant to be reused.
4.0,"Great cap. Stylish. Well-made from good materials. I've already received several compliments on it (from folks who know what GTOs are, anyway). My only minor quibble is that the velcro adjustment band (which is elasticized do it doesn't stay super tight on you) is just a wee bit large, so I don't have a tremendous amount of adjustment to make it a bit tighter. Judging by my dozens of other caps, this one is a little larger, thus doesn't have as much adjustment for my head. But it still fits fine and looks good. Overall, very satisfied and would buy it again."
4.0,"I purchased 2 XS black, 1 XS Army Cameo and 1 XS Steel Blue. The Steel blue has great elasticity, hugs my entire legs and fits perfect but the other three do not have the same elasticity. I am keeping all of them but I am a little disappointed."
4.0,"Very nice dainty earrings that are good for anyone with a hipster aesthetic or even an older lady with geometric design tastes. Personally I liked how delicate they looked and was surprised by the fact that they didn't look cheap at all! The only thing that the recipient noted was that she didn't know exactly what the earrings were supposed to be at first, but enjoyed the architectural feel. She's since gotten a lot of compliments on them, but generally people don't see the swan at first but enjoy the general hope and simple but cut look of the piece."
4.0,A mask
4.0,"This is a review of WeaArco Hip Waders. I live on a lake and the water is waist deep or less for about 100 feet from shore. I wanted these to wade out and fish around the trees instead of having to deal with the boat every time. The waders reach all the way to my butt, and I'm 5'10"". The feet fit fine, about like regular knee length rubber boots, but the fit on my upper thigh is tight enough I won't be able to wear jeans under these waders, probably just baggy shorts. The quality of the material and construction is pretty good and I expect to get lots of use out of these. The care and use instructions say they need to be hung up and dried inside and out before storing to reduce the chance of mildew. Hand wash up to tri-annually depending upon use."
4.0,"I like the dress quite a bit, although it does not fit like it looks in the picture.  The slits are up to mid-thigh, which is a little too short on me.  I'm 5'7&#34;, and the skirt reaches the ground on me.  The top seems a little big while the elastic under the chest is a little snug.  The worst part to me is that the part under the arms is cut down to my upper ribcage.  If I raise my arms at all, you can see my bra including the cups.  It works fine with a cami underneath.  The material is also really thin, and if I had gotten any other color than black, I think it would be see-through.<br /><br />Other than that the dress is lovely, easy, and comfortable.  I would defiintely buy it again, but I would home some of the construction issues would be fixed."
4.0,It is exactly what you might expect at this price point. It is cheap costume material and the suit we received is not lined at all. Overall perfect for the intended use!
4.0,big sunglasses and lens are extremely dark when looking thru them.
4.0,Very nice belt for dress or casual and it works great . No directions came with it however. Pretty easy to figure out . Packaged nicely if it‚Äôs a gift. Used it for a couple weeks now with no issues.
4.0,"Es muy lindo, solo que no estaba tan segura si era para adulto o ni√±o‚Ä¶ y si!!! Es para Ni√±o como de 3 a 5 a√±os m√°s o menos ! Pero es muy lindo y la calidad muy bonita"
4.0,"Fun dress for Halloween.  Material is forgiving and the print shows well. Delivery was fast, I would order again"
4.0,"Really cute. It faded a bit when I washed it the first time, which was disappointing as I usually launder very gently and don't have this issue with clothes. Still a really cute & soft shirt, at least."
4.0,They have held up so far! Easy to put on my childrens shoes
4.0,"Arms were too small, but great overall.  Good quality and looks way more expensive than it really is."
4.0,I like the swimming costume
4.0,"Our daughter loved giving these away as birthday party favors, but the colors were a bit lacking. Overall not bad though. :)"
4.0,looks great quality good but a little snug
4.0,"This shirt is large, even a small was still big but it is very flowy and comfortable so i will keep for leggings and such."
4.0,"Not what I was expecting, I expecting  a but more rear lifting I guess.<br />I'm used to te Colombian booty shapers"
4.0,"This is so cute, that I didn't dare to put on the floor, so I put on my desk, under my keyboard. Perfect!"
4.0,Jacket looks good. Not quite like the pics but still cute. It runs big. I bought a small and I‚Äôm swimming in it
4.0,"It is absolutely gorgeous. My girlfriend loved it. She did sorta pick it out. I gave her like 10 links and she gave me 5 to choose from and I picked. We couldn't get a metal band because she is allergic to cheap metal (can't remember the type of metals).<br /><br />Concerns: This has metal in the locking clasp. This is one of those things we had to go with because of options for bands. She didn't get immediate reactions (itching, redness, breaking out) and she didn't get harsh reactions either. After most of the day she had light itchiness but she still wears it.<br /><br />The other one is the locking mechanism (on the fitbit side). When I would try to set her fitbit on a fitbit stand I ordered her, sometimes the connecting part of the band might pop off of the fitbit. HOWEVER, she has been wearing it since Christmas time and hasn't complained about it popping off of her wrist. That is why I gave it 4 stars. If I could, I would give it a 4.5 or so stars."
4.0,"While I am sure I would have liked these during my long distance running years, I bought them for compression support for an upcoming hip replacement where my surgeon recommends compression shorts. The fit and finish are very nice and I am sure they will do the job just fine."
4.0,I‚Äôm a big vionic fan Is these are cute
4.0,These socks are well made and comfortable.  My second pair of socks from this company.
4.0,Bigger than normal
4.0,It‚Äôs an awesome suit for the price. A little cheeky then what i would normally wear. My only complaint it the clasp is hard to clip on the back. I have to clasp it before putting it on or have help.
4.0,"This onesie runs big, but it is expected and what i was looking for. It is super warm and great quality. I had read it is super soft, however in my opinion it is about average to my standards, that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt comfortable! I absolutely love this onesie and I highly recommend as a gift!"
4.0,I haven't used it yet to see how warm it is. I love that the ball snaps off so you can wash the hat.
4.0,"I was concerned by the ""one size fits all"" nature of this product, especially since I was buying it for my husband who has big hands. But it really does fit all, or at least the mittens fit both him and me, even though I have fairly small hands."
4.0,Nice ring for the price.
4.0,Too long for my like so I returned it.
4.0,fit my grand daughter  so it worked out
4.0,"Super comfy material but I ordered a size up (xl, when I normally fit between a medium to large) because of the reviews saying this runs small. Wish I had gone with a large. Probably gonna try to exchange this one."
4.0,"My 7-year-old loves the cat face.  She says it pulls on her ears.  We will try stretching it to fit more comfortably.  The inner material is stiffer than the outer, but it's soft enough."
4.0,Super cute some were a little flattened out hopefully good quality when put to the test
4.0,"A little small, but easily bent to fit correctly. Very cute."
4.0,"Very cute! Not too short like other costumes. Perfect for Oktoberfest. Follow measurements in the size chart, not size number you normally wear. The dirndl is very forgiving if you drink beer & eat pretzels!"
4.0,Super cute but the 0-6 months size won‚Äôt fit until she‚Äôs at least one. It would fit my 2 year old. But he probably wouldn‚Äôt appreciate wearing a ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù onesie and floral pants. It‚Äôs really more like 12-18 months
4.0,I like it!  It fits great and is soft. I got the large and it fits great in length too. Got it to wear on next flight and i'm sure it will be comfy.
4.0,Great shirt. Comfortable and well made for the price.
4.0,"I gave this Dawfold Beanie Hat and Scarf Set for Women, Warm Fleece Lined Knit Skull Cap Neck Warmer Set for Winter Ski Snow Cold Weather to my 12-year-old daughter. She loved the colors and how warm and soft it is. The inside is lined and keeps the wind old. She does wish the hat was a bit bigger though. She says it‚Äôs a tad tight and doesn‚Äôt stay down on her head."
4.0,shes been looking for a long time
4.0,"Nice and comfortable bathrobe, good to wear after a shower or getting up in the morning in cold weather."
4.0,"Love how these shoes look.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size & have to wait for my daughter to grow quite a bit before she can wear these.  Was going to return them but they took so long to get here (shipped from China).  I didn't want to wait that long for the correct size.  So decided I'd keep them for her to grow into."
4.0,Top is somewhat loose fitting with the elastic but it is very cute and not too loose to not wear.
4.0,These were absolutely adorable and stylish but just a little too small so I had to return them.
4.0,Chain is longer than expected but I love the color and came in record time.
4.0,"Shirts are fine--good quality, good deal. I'm 5'10&#34;, 185 pounds. Ordered large and they are too tight. Wish I'd gone with XL. I'm going to keep them for undershirts but too small for me to wear respectably at the gym."
4.0,"fleece inside, cotton outside, not waterproof.<br />Your child will never lose their mittens again with these!"
4.0,"I wish I got a size smaller since it was too big, but I was able to tie it just fine. I am 5'3, size 6 dress, very curvy, Romantic/theatrical Romantic body type. This dress was very flattering and good quality. However, the shoulder flaps are too big and had to be taken in as well."
4.0,I liked the bright colors and texture.
4.0,"Bought as a gift, so not sure on the fit but seemed like good quality. Better in person than the picture."
4.0,"Really pretty color and design, great length, fits great with no need to size up. But the surface of the garment, the outside of it, feels a bit like polyester, even after a pre-wash. I'd prefer it to feel more like cotton. Maybe it's got this finish to make it last longer? We'll see."
4.0,"Very warm, soft, fits well and looks nice.  Time will tell how sturdy it is. It doesn't look that well made (several loose and dangling threads) and hope it lasts for more than a couple of seasons. One thing I miss from my old coat is a double zipper.  This manufacturer should consider changing to a double zipper."
4.0,"Nice watch as usual from Invicta. However the band IS NOT stainless as it says, it is silicon with aluminum parts and inserts. I would give it five stars if it was represented properly."
4.0,The teens seem to dig these.
4.0,"This Pearl Beaded Necklace Smiley Face Flower Beaded Necklace with Bead Pearls is great for young girls as stocking stuffers. The necklace comes in a sealed package which keeps it tangle-free. The flowers are a bit more chunky than I first expected. It does lay flat very well. This is a cute fashion jewelry necklace that has a secure and easily open and close clasp. The additional links allow customization. For the price, it is a good deal and I love that. See my pictures for what you receive and how it actually looks like being worn."
4.0,"As expected, fast shipping."
4.0,"These are beautiful. However, the fingers are a bit long for a normal person and sometime make the person wearing them like the Grinch."
4.0,One of the cutest coin purses I've came across in a long time! It's the perfect size (slightly bigger  than my palm) and is super adorable. I'm slightly concerned on the durability but so far no problems yet. It attracts cat hair and fine dirt like no other so that's a little irritating and one of the ears gets stuck every time I latch it shut. But for the price its worth it.
4.0,"These socks are great for slip on tennis shoes, loafers, and boat shoes. They don‚Äôt show and they usually stay up. I took off a star because they tend to get holes in the toes a little too quickly."
4.0,nice....fits well...
4.0,"Comfortable, but is a bit looser than I expected. Probably better to size down."
4.0,"Super cute, good quality. Evidently not completely accurate on character... my son says the little watch thing should go with Hermione costume, not Harry Potter. Also, would give 5 stars if came with more than one lightning tattoo.... most costumes are not just worn once and that can't be too costly to add a few extra."
4.0,"I love the dress, the color was correct.<br />I order my size but I should order one size up but it fits but not as comfortable. Also, I wish it came with Instructions of how to do the back, other then that it was greaT<br /><br />I order size 16"
4.0,I wanted to love this top.  The fit is good and comfortable.  However - those straps are another story.....so itchy.  There is exposed elastic/rubber at the base of each strap that completely irritate my back.  It was challenging to relax and perform my practice while my back was itchy.  I would return this except I washed and dried it hoping the irritation would subside. No luck - I will try to add moleskin to the base of each strap to cover the exposed elastic to try and soften the feel.  Very disappointed
4.0,Very pretty pendant especially for a preteen's birthday gift.
4.0,"shoulders were too puffy--made me look like a football player so I had to return. If they'd fix the shoulders, I'd buy 5 of them."
4.0,"The only thing that would better, would be if the sleeve edges and collar edges were smoother , then it would really pass as a professional dress.<br /><br />As reference. I'm 5'5&#34;, 133 pounds, VS 32DD. I got a Medium. Though, I could've gotten a small..."
4.0,Muy bonito. Difiere con la fotograf√≠a porque se aprecia ser mas largo.
4.0,Exactly what I wanted. But I must have found them too late in the season as there are few colors in my size.
4.0,"The jeans fit really great.  They are so soft and comfortable.  The only complaint that I have is the drawstring.  It didn't feel good on my abdomen.  I have had some surgery and I think a wider waistband that is a little more snug would work better.  Other than that, they are awesome!"
4.0,These are cute on. The lens are not as dark as you would expect them to be. They are mainly just for looks
4.0,I‚Äôm pretty happy with this dress. It looks like the picture but is a touch shiny and the cheap ‚Äúmilk silk‚Äù like material. It‚Äôs heavy so it drapes nicely but didn‚Äôt feel too hot. It‚Äôs very comfortable. I got several compliments on it. I belted it with a vintage stretchy belt from the thrift store. The pockets are deep and at the right length and lay flat.<br /><br />I am a size 20/22 and 5‚Äô8. I love the way the dress fits me.<br /><br />For the price I think its a good deal but its not a 5 Star dress simply because it does look a little cheapy up close.
4.0,"This reading glasses are great for carrying in my purse, so I always have a pair handy."
4.0,"As expected, a well functioning umbrella."
4.0,I like Design and cooper could be little Bigger
4.0,"The cover was slightly dirty, had to be cleaned, cute"
4.0,"These sandals are so cute!  The little flowers are like pieces of art.  They are very well made  and the soles are soft and cushioning to your feet. The toe thong is cushioned so it doesn‚Äôt hurt at all. However, there is just something about these shoes that make them hard for me to walk in. They feel very much like flip flops only they don‚Äôt flex with your foot the same way, so I find my myself trying to grip them with my toes while I walk to keep them from falling off.<br />I love them so much that I‚Äôm trying to figure out a way to get them to stay on better!"
4.0,Very thin and cheaply made but it is cute
4.0,I ordered an XL and it fit as expected.  It is a little longer than I like but the design is so cute and the shirt is soft so I am keeping it.  I am 5'5 200 lbs and the XL worked for me.
4.0,"Good headband....it does not hold all of my hair up inside like I wanted, but it is still a good product."
4.0,They are good for what you pay. Really comfortable on. Love the colors
4.0,"It is very cute and squishy.  Kids love it.  This one, however, is a replacement.  The original one had a &#34;run&#34; in the seams, and the beads flowed out.  It was a little at a time, as the stitches were still together.  They were just loose, and let the insides come out.  Eventually it &#34;deflated&#34; way too much, and it wasn't fun anymore.  So, the replacement came.  Not sure if it will hold up, but hoping.  If not, I guess they are not made to be played with (which would defeat the whole purpose, methinks)."
4.0,Only problem was I had to sew the straps to adjust it smaller because the shoulders was to big for me. I'm  5'3. Maybe I was  to short for this jumper.
4.0,"Looks great as an over tank to my bralette I purchased. The cut in the front is not as I expected, but still looks cute."
4.0,"Really cute! Love the size and color, tint is just enough for the Florida sun. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the quality is a little cheap."
4.0,"This is a super cute beanie, however I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because it fits so tight on my head, it gives me a headache after an hour. Maybe I just have a big head or something, but still..."
4.0,Cute but not the best quality
4.0,"I like this mask.  It's VERY breathable, the material is really thin.  Holds up to the washing machine as well.<br /><br />Only thing I don't like is that it feels tight around my neck - Maybe its b/c I just have a fat neck??  :)"
4.0,The color is nice. The top is comfortable and cute.
4.0,"Excellent very close to the color ordered a shade off, fit runs a little bigger, soft material thinner great with boots or leggings, I'm 5'3"" hits right above knee."
4.0,Very comfortable and durable. All the other students on the mat wanted them. I think they are a wonderful value and great find
4.0,"just like I remember them in the past, warm"
4.0,Great stocking stuffers. Fun for preschool class. Don't expect them to last long but you can't beat the price.
4.0,i've been buying this type of boots for over ten yrs now i have three pairs two black and one brown good price and they are harley and i do own one of them 25 yrs old but love it and go buy the boots black or brown good deal
4.0,"This outfit is super cute, but is hard to keep wrinkle free even on a hanger.  Highly recommend owning a small steamer, steam it right before you wear it."
4.0,"Good quality belt, but it cuts into my back fat and is really unflattering. I'm a size 12 for reference."
4.0,"It runs small, but fits nicely when bought in a bigger size"
4.0,"Pretty dress, but it has ZERO give in the waist. I wore some mega-spanx and managed. If I had gone up a size it would have been too big in the chest. Overall, ok!"
4.0,For the price it is great. Not sure how long they will last after working out and washing. Wish the material was more like wicking fabric vs it feels a little on the plastic side. Not bad but compared to name brand versions there is a different feel. Good tho.
4.0,"I love Toad and Co's clothing in general. It's super soft, durable, and the prints are really cute. They're great for summer travel, wear-to-work with leggings, or just for lounging around. Well worth the price, in my opinion.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this dress is the low neckline. This isn't the first T&C dress I've owned that has that issue, and this dress exacerbates the problem because it's a real--not faux--wrap dress. I wear a tanktop and leggings underneath, to avoid showing too much, and that works fine."
4.0,Replacement for the original band that came with the Moto 360. Looks nice but is a little shorter than the original.
4.0,"This is a terrific jersey.  The only issue is sizing.  They are made for soccer players.  If you are carrying a few extra pounds, order the next size up from your regular t-shirt size."
4.0,Very cute patterns and colors. They seem to run a little small though.
4.0,Love lace socks! However some felt a little small while others were just fine.
4.0,seemed a little different than I thought it was going to be but its hard to tell with such a small picture
4.0,Cute wood bracket perfect fit
4.0,If you are larger chested just prepare for a tight fit up top and really good fitting below :)
4.0,"I'm always in search of a red necklace for my mother because years ago the string broke on her favorite necklace and she has never been able to find a replacement. I purchased this necklace in hopes it would work for her, sadly it doesn't because of the weight of the beads. The beads are made of a resin and with so many on there it is a heavy necklace and it is too heavy for her neck. For me it was just fine. It feels heavy when I hold it, but when I put it on it distributes the weight. I still notice the weight, but it doesn't feel as heavy on my neck as it does when I'm just holding it in my hand.<br /><br />The necklace is a beautiful red color, however it's not a solid red. It's a red with some darker black marbling throughout each bead. When you look at the image provided by the seller this isn't noticeable unless you magnify the image to get a closer look. I love the necklace the way it is, but that's something my mom wouldn't want as much as she was looking for more of a solid colored bead.<br /><br />On some of the strands there are seed beads separating the bigger beads. In one of the pictures the beads look clear, which is what I have, in another picture they have those seed beads look red. I'm not sure if that's because they are showing two different necklaces or if it's because the lighting if reflecting the red thread through the clear beads just right. Either way I wanted to point this out in case that detail makes a difference to you.<br /><br />I can tell the beads aren't plastic because of their weight and how cool they feel to the touch. This is a good thing for me.<br /><br />I took a star off on this necklace because at the back clasp of the necklace where each strand of beads end they have them ended with a clamshell. In the necklace I received this is a bit messy with the thread of several of the strands sticking out, obviously glued (as they should be) but still frayed looking which gave it a messy unfinished appearance. On a few ends they managed to contain the thread in the clamshell and it would have been better if they could have done this with all of them.<br /><br />The clasp at the back is a lobster claw and it works well. The chain is adjustable so you can make it a bit longer or shorter to fit you better. I did notice that there is a small bead at the end of the adjustment chain in the photo, this bead is not there on my necklace.<br /><br />Overall I like this necklace. It's a beautiful red color and looks fantastic on me. There were only minor issues I had with the necklace that I mentioned for purposes of review, but honestly it's nothing I would have paid much attention to had I not been writing a review. I do recommend this necklace.<br /><br />I received this necklace at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own."
4.0,"They‚Äôre a perfect fit, except they‚Äôre sliders. They constantly slide down. You‚Äôre constantly pulling them up. They also had part of the stitching on the seem starting to come apart when I pulled the first pair out. The second pair appears to be good. But they‚Äôre extremely comfortable minus the constantly pulling them up part!"
4.0,"Thick fabric, bright colors, cute dress"
4.0,Although they look too fake they are nice additions to a young girl's jewelry box...Until you're ready to gift them with real gold stuff
4.0,"Adorable, perfect TTS fit!"
4.0,"Very good looking pair of distressed jeans. Loving the white track stripes. I would say they run a little large, so for a slimmer fit, I'd go down a size. They are made of a stretch material so sizing down won't be too drastic."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter who loves anything Anime. It's a really cute shirt but is made of a heavy polyester (almost mesh) material. I would have definitely preferred a cotton/polyester blend or 100% cotton.
4.0,The watch still works and a year later still running. She doesn't wear it that often.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They fit great. The only slight downside is that you can almost see through the butt area. But my daughter is skinny with a bubble butt so that might be why. She loves the pocket on the side. They‚Äôll work great for tennis as a place to put extra tennis balls!!
4.0,Nice necklace and I love it
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter for a wedding, and she looked beautiful.  I added a colorful sash at the waist, as it was plenty large for her.  There is no zipper, elastic, or buttons, and the back is quite low.  Fabric is see through, but the price is right!"
4.0,We have them in two different colors- nice change from a black leather case for both.
4.0,This was a great mask for my catwoman Halloween costume. It does fit tightly on the head which should be expected from this tight fitting type of costume. There is a strap on the chin section that you cannot see well in the stock photo. It causes the face to  have a scrunched up look and doesn't quite give the Michelle Phiffer look is was going for. I just cut off the strap and then it looked perfect! I received so many compliments from my friends. I would defiantly recommend. I would have given five stars if I didn't have to do the altering. Great product!
4.0,Awsome 360 men's boxer briefs.  5 pack of black cotton and polyester briefs.  The waist band is a good quality elastic  and the briefs are comfortable. The fit is good and accurate.  These dont ride up per my brother and they are soft and dont pinch or cause any irritation. Great quality mens boxer brief that wash well without shrinking.
4.0,"Cute, Cozy and wear it often!"
4.0,Cute earrings.  A little smaller than I envisioned but they were noticeable because they sparkled.
4.0,This dress is so adorable!  The fit was a little clingy and the material was thankfully not the thin cheap crap.  I received several compliments when wearing!
4.0,"The dress fit as expected, high quality"
4.0,"When I saw these glasses I had to have them. Pictures suggested that they were oversized glasses which is what I was looking for but when I received them they were a little on the small side. Everything else about them were great, shipping was super fast but had to get a 4 and not a 5 because they were too small."
4.0,Very comfortable sports-type bra. My only complete is that inserts shift when washed. I tack them down.
4.0,"This is SO cute. Got it for my 2.5 y/o and it is the perfect size. Remember to remove the plastic film or it will look scratched. The little bag also works as a backpack. And the 4 wheels help a lot for a toddler who likes to push rather than pull. Only reason i did not give it 5 stars 1) plastic film is under every part so taking it off is hard, some pieces remain in the seems and plastic parts (no big deal) 2) My son LOVES this so much he plays with it all around the house, and now it has some scratches. Cannot blame the product but given that is for the travel, I would have hoped for more scratch resistance. All in all VERY happy with the purchase. Very nice graphics *my wife did not want some known name cartoons etc so this worked great*"
4.0,"These were a little tight in the waist and a little bit long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù tall, weigh 144, and normally wear a size 6. Needed a size 8 in these. They‚Äôre really cute and well made though!"
4.0,Material was pretty thin.
4.0,"Fits well, nice full length, good quality. Colors are accurate and did not fade when washed. I am enjoying these."
4.0,"nice sunglasses, I like the leather on the arms of the sunglasses. it makes it comfortable.."
4.0,I have not had the time to use yet.  The product appears to be well
4.0,Fit great and the lenses were a nice size. Two for the price of one is great because my 1 year old likes to play with my glasses. So far they have held up well.
4.0,"Cute and soft. My niece is a little thick, buy not much more than average and the 3T fit her just right, but not much growing room, especially lengthwise. Should have purchased 4t but shes just barely going to be three."
4.0,Ala ni√±a le encant√≥ esta muy bien y el precio est√° perfecto
4.0,"Fits great. Never understood why they called unlined bras minimizers as it doesn‚Äôt make you smaller, it just doesn‚Äôt add anything. The only minor complaints is the seams and the fact that I couldn‚Äôt get an answer as to where it was made. Box says China."
4.0,"Fun set of earrings. A little larger than I expected, but comfortable. They came a little scuffed, but not so much that it bothered me."
4.0,It was perfect. Feels like decent quality. I have been wearing it daily and have no discoloration issues. It feels light but my one year old can tug and it has survived.
4.0,"Having this hat makes me feel prepared for the cold Midwest winter ahead. I walk to work, so having a warm hat is a must. What I like about this hat is the ear flaps that provide excellent coverage. A regular beanie can ride up and leave the bottom of your ears exposed, but not this hat. I also like that there‚Äôs a chin strap, so there‚Äôs no chance of this hat flying off or getting out of place  with a big gust of wind. I know I will be fully protected this winter. The hat does come with a mouth/nose guard piece, but I just find this a little awkward and it causes my glasses to fog up. I‚Äôll stick to a scarf to keep my lower face warm if needed."
4.0,"These are just the ticket for my daughter, they are cute and inexpensive in case she loses them.  Don't expect a heavy-duty item, it is rather light and fragile."
4.0,"Love the material, great fit. Would buy again."
4.0,I like the style and material the color is also good what I don't like is the sleeve the length is excellent it would've been a perfect jacket except not enough room in the sleeve for layering you could do that but it looks very bulky that's a draw back for me otherwise it's a good purchase at a reasonable price. Thank You
4.0,They work great and more comfortable than I expected. Great value 4 the money.
4.0,"This is a great concept, but I have rather fluffy hair so this is a little bit small for me. I still got it to work after playing around with it but it doesn‚Äôt fit like the women in the picture."
4.0,Iron on decal -that‚Äôs ok. Starting to develop a sweat line which implies that I will be washing this buggar in the not too distant future so we‚Äôll see if this inexpensive cover can take the heat.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. Why not 5 stars? Well, the sizing is a bit off. My slim, ballet dancing daughter (typical beautiful ballet build, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 117lbs) needs a medium. This dress was part of her birthday present and the small was too small in the chest area. She typically wears a small, so I think that the sizing on this dress is off. Order one size up so you don‚Äôt have to go through the return process like I do."
4.0,This is very cute for causal wear.... love the soft fabric and a nice touch on the sleeves. I am sure I will get a lot of wear.
4.0,"Be forewarned; you have to have the right kind of booty for it. Had a friend recommend these. She‚Äôs got a big booty so I thought I‚Äôd give it a go. Sadly, it looked like two Christmas hams fighting over the crack. I actually see a resemblance to my great aunt Berta. Took them off quickly and gave them away. Now I‚Äôm going to go cry in my jogging pants"
4.0,I got these as a gift from my husband and they are really big. Even though they are bigger than what I normally but I still love them and they are very comfortable.
4.0,I order  this for my water aerobic classes; I  can find cheaper in stores during the summer sale but I didn't have time to wait. I used it for only a couple of times so I cannot make a statement about durability.
4.0,would preferred have month displayed  instead of stopwatch and alarms as in my old F-28W
4.0,I do have to say the magnets work crazy good! I was wearing them for I believe a total of 4 hours and my nose began to hurt due to the magnets holding each other up on my septum. One thing to keep in mind is that you will have to have it in a higher position in your septum if you have too much cartilage closer to the bottom.
4.0,"Nice, and fit well, especially since I have a smaller face. Wish the temples were hook back (around the back of the ear) but that style seems to be disappearing."
4.0,The belt is beautiful. How ever the buttons kept popping open the entire day. Other then that the belt is a great material.
4.0,"I had to buy 2 suits because I knew I would be a medium or large for the shorts, and a small for the top. Wide hips, small bust. But, the price was low enough that I felt fine doing it. I actually love the way it looks on me. I have a nasty c-section scar and above it the accompanying &#34;pouch&#34; that I'm more comfortable if it's all covered. This suit does just that! Very pleased."
4.0,"Very pretty necklace,I hope it does not tarnish."
4.0,Very nice looking pendant necklace. The cubic zirconia makes it sparkle and come alive. The double chain is very popular and this look is much preferred to the traditional necklaces.
4.0,"My daughter is small for a 2 year old and this barely fits her, I cant imagine trying to fit a 4 year old in this!"
4.0,Works really good. Great for people who don't want numbers on the face.
4.0,Fast shipping fit as expected
4.0,"It was a nice swim suit. It fit well, as expected. Simple and basic, but a bit cheeky. I did end up returning it because I feel like it‚Äôs more for a younger girl."
4.0,"Expensive, but reusable and cute!"
4.0,The fabric is soft. I expected something different but it fits great. Great work or church dress. Purchased the size 8.
4.0,"Hey, I put this hat on, but it did not make me ride any faster !! Jokes aside, I am a big fan of Wout van Aert and Primoz Roglic from Team Jumbo Visma.  This hat comes in only one size.  On my adult male head it fit really really tight. The hat is not adjustable in any way.  It just has elastic in the back, but even with the elastic giving, it fit really uncomfortably tight.  Though, it was never my intention to wear it under my bike helmet.  I have the hat sitting on a display shelf with some cool bike books.  I got it only for display purposes to support my favorite professional bike team.  By the way, there are some cool Tour de France flags available on Amazon you should check out.  Speaking of the 2022 Tour de France, I see a GC race between Primoz Roglic and Geraint Thomas (Team Sky).  May the best rider win........."
4.0,"Awesome for traveling. It fits 3 pairs of sunglasses and it protects them. Once you close it the sunglasses stay in place, which is awesome since they throw around your luggage at airports. I use the extra pocket for the sunglasses bags. You can‚Äôt put any accessories on it because they fall out and will scratch your glagless. Besides that everything about this item is good and in my opinion it‚Äôs a should buy."
4.0,"this product is exactly as described. Although I'm not sure why most people would buy this (I'm a vegetarian who was going to Oktoberfest, so Leiderhosen wasn't an option), those who do will find it a bit tight in the area that matters, but otherwise a great purchase."
4.0,The winter head coverings are warm and useful for cold climates.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but it‚Äôs white gold. If you‚Äôre looking for a deep real good color don‚Äôt get this one! But it is cute and sturdy
4.0,"Somewhat small for all my &#34;stuff&#34;, but the quality is very nice."
4.0,"Came on time and the shoe fits, but i should have ordered a size up because its hard to zip it up in the back. other than that they are perfect"
4.0,"If I didn't wear a white, longsleeve turtleneck underneath, this would not have been a good outfit.-- it's see-through. Also, I believe I am the maximum size for this at 40-30-40 measurements. It's also pretty short, and I'm 5'6&#34;, so make sure you have a good pair of shorts or something underneath."
4.0,Its warm and a good look.
4.0,"Great quality , high waist, flattering & soft leggings! My only complaint is the looseness in the crotch area. I‚Äôm usually a size 6 in leggings. For reference I am 5‚Äô2 and about 125 & pear shaped. I got the size small/medium & it was loose in the crotch area & kind of bunches up on me. I won‚Äôt return because the price is great & I can wear a longer shirt to cover the front area. Worth the price in my opinion. If they had more sizing options I would buy them all! Get you some leggings boo!"
4.0,"I wasn't making any fashion statements with this on, but it did the job and kept me warm."
4.0,Nice to for the price.  Received many compliments.
4.0,"It's very nice, comfortable and flattering for my figure."
4.0,"These are nice, I like that the double lined crotch area is sewn all the way across, much more comfortable."
4.0,This dress fits very well I had to have it hemmed up I'm only 5 1 other than that the material is great the bottom is a little heavier than I expected but overall I'm very comfortable in this dress I got lots of compliments
4.0,Es m√°s fina y peque√±a q lo q se ve en la Foto
4.0,My wife loved this little wallet! She recently downsized her purse and wallet and the size is perfect. She's had it for about a month and so far hasn't noticed any break down of quality of the material it is made of. We have no way to test the rfid capability so who knows on that aspect.
4.0,"Nice light weight shorts, good fit, sizing accurate."
4.0,Good fit and comfortable sunglasses. They feel pretty light and they have good vision coverage.<br />So far so good with these.
4.0,I sure don't see where this is adjustable.  Too big for my wrist.  Wish I would have known that before purchasing.
4.0,36dd 5'7. Top is a little smaller then should be but still fits. Got xl.
4.0,came in great condition and very soft
4.0,"Size great. Color not what I expected. Overall however, I was happy with it."
4.0,Just very cute earrings
4.0,Very nice looking top. Fits great.
4.0,"Very Nice item, as I wished !"
4.0,"Smelled a little strange when it came out of the packaging like spray paint, other than that good!"
4.0,"Arrived very fast, smaller than I hoped for but beautiful"
4.0,Super cool elegant supplim
4.0,"I loved dress and material, it fit like a glove. Not too short, I wore this to a lounge and got a lot of compliments. I would buy again."
4.0,Really cute suit but torso too long for my short body.
4.0,Purchased for grandkid. Works fine and was as expected.
4.0,It's a nice robe.  A little rough on the skin after washing once.  I think it will soften up over time.  Fits fine.  Functional
4.0,"I really like the look of this bag; it appears to be well made and the green color is exactly whats shown in the photo .  I gave it a 4 because I have not used it yet.  After I use it, I'll update my review."
4.0,"These earrings were such a good buy! I even had to share a few with my sister. This is an excellent buy for some trendy, fashionable earrings that speak for themselves  It‚Äôs nice to have these since they are priced well, & I‚Äôm not afraid to lose them! I definitely recommend it. A great little collection that will get you lots of compliments."
4.0,Very nicely made shirt at onset. No idea how it will wash and wear. Felt it was a little short but I like my shirts longer than most. The look and feel is very nice.
4.0,beautiful shoes but too large.  I usually wear an 8 but have recently lost weight.  Gonna try shoe fillers and see if that helps.  Will return for smaller size as an absolute necessity.
4.0,"Super cute summer dress! Not the highest quality, it is not lined, but I didn't really expect it to be. For the price point it's a beautiful full length maxi dress! I will definitely be wearing this piece a lot this summer and probably year round just with extra layers underneath &lt;3 I  a true XL and ordered an XL and it fits as I'd hope!"
4.0,"This shirt is very soft & well made, the friend I bought it for as a gift really likes it"
4.0,"I like the shirt, but it has the typical Lands End tailoring where the bottom of the shirt is just a couple inches below the waist. It looks a bit off, just hanging rather than laying if it were longer. So, I tuck it into my jeans and it stays without pulling out.<br /><br />The material and color are really nice. Instructions say to wash it separately and dry it separately the first time before you wear it. I did that and there were no issues later with the color running on to anything else. Didn't need to iron it."
4.0,"As silly as it seems this hair catcher is a life saver. It's entertaining for my son and doesn't let the hair get all over him. He used to cry during haircuts because the falling hair would itch and bother him, but now he can watch it fall and not be worried about the irritations."
4.0,I'm satisfied with it
4.0,These are great. I just had surgery and can't put weight on my left leg. I was looking for something like the grip sox they gave me in the hospital. These are by far better. They actually fit my feet and they grip so much better.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and the back is nice. Not bad for the price.
4.0,I love the earring and everything but it is definitely longer then what it is said to be. It sticks out far from my ear.
4.0,Super cute. Kinda thin material. Seems like it won‚Äôt wash well. Almost feels like pajama material. But she was overjoyed with how cute it is!
4.0,I loved the style but definitely men sizing. Was just way too big for my average sized women‚Äôs head. The quality is very decent. Yes highly recommend but sized large. Therefore had to return.
4.0,Every year we make lanterns for Martinmas and we usually use batter operated tea lights but this year I had a bunch of these left over from Halloween treats and so we used them.  They worked so well in the lanterns and I'm going to buy these every year.  Some of them didn't work but that's how it goes.
4.0,Wish it was a zipper instead of buttons
4.0,"These dresses are beautiful. They are well made with silky, heavy fabric, no need to wear a slip. However the arm holes got a little gappy for me so I just got some lace ribbon from Walmart and liquid stitched it under the slits. Now they are gorgeous and unique! A great buy and a quick fix."
4.0,Great fit except too big in the boobs. I immediately took out the underwire and extra padding and it does help.
4.0,"Ordered a size up from my regular size. Snug fit till  you feet break them in. Extremely soft üíì, bottoms nice and sturdy, I'm not worried about a stroll to get the mail or a quick ride on the car.<br />I only gave it a star less, they came from China since the other company was out, the email explaining was delayed. A couple weeks of womder."
4.0,"I ordered a Large thinking it would be nice and flowing, but it isn't.  It was snug around the hip, but It is as described and I am happy enough to not return.  I wish I had ordered a size bigger."
4.0,"Very thick heavy duty material. Good for winter wear. Too short and all-around too small for me (5'9, 32 inch waist). Had to return it."
4.0,Redd an XL and easily could‚Äôve & should‚Äôve done the L
4.0,A little see through near the top but still nice
4.0,"my boys like them, they are light and kids are able to run around etc."
4.0,"I wore it on a first date, and I felt fabulous! Definitely felt amazing in it."
4.0,I normally wear a 2X but as I looked at these PJ's I had the feeling they were going to be to small so I ordered a 3X.<br />even at the 3X they are not as loose and comfortable as I like my PJ's.
4.0,Beautiful dress fits perfectly.Wearing dress to my daughter's wedding.....love it!!
4.0,TO HEAVY FOR WARM WEATHER . WOULD BE GOOD FOR WINTER
4.0,"Handmade in Vietnam. I bought this from another seller for half as much as the price listed at the time of this writing. This is nearly identical to the ones made in the 1950's and perhaps earlier. Chin strap is only decorative until you replace the flimsy cotter pin with an actual rivet. Chin strap is genuine leather but it's thin (approx. 2mm). Helmet is made of a white, fibrous, paper-like material (actual sola pith) covered with strips of thin wood (most likely wicker which is what was traditionally used for reinforcement) and finally covered with cotton twill fabric. Yes the head harness is riveted to plastic tabs but they even did it that way back in the 1950's. If you're careful, the harness can be removed from the helmet. All rivets, eyelets, and fasteners appear to be non-rusting metals (aluminum, copper, etc). The head band is adjustable and fastens with Velcro (not from the 1950's but who cares). The scalp harness is cotton fabric bands which is somewhat adjustable if you're willing to untie the cotton string, give or take up slack, and retie it. Ideally, you want to adjust the helmet to sit off your head. It should float above and around your head and not touch you head to the extent that is possible. The sweatband and harness are cotton twill and seem to absorb sweat fairly well.<br />These are said to have been traditionally dunked in water prior to wearing to provide evaporative cooling. I don't recommend doing that. I have tried it and found that the glue used in these helmets to fasten the cotton twill to the inside dies not seem waterproof. I have noticed the twill sagging loose from the wood especially on the inside of the helmet. The makers should use a better glue, in my opinion. Another possibility is that since pith is sponge-like, it swells a bit as it absorbs water and stretches the fabric. Then as it dries, the fabric remains slightly stretched. In either case, it can affect the beauty of the helmet so if you get this for a costume, don't wet it. That said, water does enhance the cooling effect of the helmet. You can feel a difference. The sagging of fabric is really just cosmetic. The helmet still functions properly when wet. Also, unscrew the chimney cap (button on top) and make sure the fabric around the hole is trimmed. If not, you can carefully trim the hole clear with small scissors. Any fabric in that space will impede air flow and prevent the helmet from working properly. When dry<br />(without getting the helmet wet) this works good as any straw hat with a vented crown (including Safari hats, cowboy hats, lifeguard hats, etc.). I use mine as an outdoor work hat so I have soaked mine for additional cooling."
4.0,"Comfortable dress. I expected it to be closer to an empire waist--instead, it's just very high-waisted. Not too different though. I wear a size 10 dress and the large fit well."
4.0,"So very very soft.<br />Wish it was a bit longer but I do have a longer torso, so something to keep in mind. Besides that I like the fit and colors, did I mention how soft it was?<br />Also I've found it to be ""delicate"", as in, easy to snag. If you gently stretch just right you can get the thread kinda back in there but it was a little annoying.<br />But overall I like it, very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Great info if you have superb eyesight, even if it is a bit clunky to operate."
4.0,"I am a small person with a little wrist. It a bit big but I love it. I am a type 2diabetic so having a medical bracelet is very helpful, just in case I have a low blood sugar episode, I can let others know of my condition."
4.0,Does not look as good as the picture.
4.0,Great book that anyone who enjoys Nord culture sure definitely check out. The only thing wrong with this book is that it wasn't long enough!
4.0,The dress is pretty but bigger than I expected. I ordered a small and the dress was a lot bigger in the bust so it doesn‚Äôt fit quite right
4.0,"Super cute! Good fabric, ordered similar and they were cheap fabric? This one not the knit yoga fabric but looks like actual cotton.  Fit is small, needed a small and ordered medium and it fits perfectly. Stitching looks a little loose, I have a sewing machine so I will just go over it."
4.0,"Great. Came on time and was a big hit at parties.<br />They fit great on adult heads, but because the antlers are heavy, they tend to slip and tilt forward.<br />Only negative is that the bell fell off during shipping. Nothing a glue gun can't fix, but I suppose stitching it down may work better."
4.0,"Beautiful and help for professional setting. They are very solid and the tubing is perfect length so i am comfortable they wont fall out. Ive had them a while now and im pleased; however, they did start to get dingy. But i assume its because i wore them in the shower. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,"These are really nicely made and high quality. The only negative thing I would say is that the wood beads aren't the same nice beige color that is pictured. Mine are kind of a green color. But, the workmanship and quality is so high, I decided to overlook the color. Also, it isn't the right size for me to wear as a bracelet. It is too big if I wrap it around my wrist 4 times, and I'm not comfortable stretching it to wrap it five times.  I wish I could wear it as a bracelet, but I use it as a very long necklace instead. :)"
4.0,couldn't get one from target this one will do
4.0,This product runs a little small. I ordered it for my boyfriend and he loves it but I ordered him a large and wasn't long enough for him when he is six foot.
4.0,Fits my phone well and gives it the protection I need. I have had it on my phone for about one month so far. I‚Äôve dripped the phone twice since I have had the case in and the rubberized coating seems to scratch off and show white underneath. It also cracked slightly by the camera but at least it protected my phone. It‚Äôs a great standard case and I would buy another one.
4.0,"I'm 5'4 180 lbs with a 38 DDD. I ordered a Large.<br /><br />I absolutely love this dress. I would have gave it a 5 star, but it's really really short. I couldn't bend over without mooning everyone around me. Something you should wear boy shorts with and have to kneel down to pick anything up."
4.0,"I enjoy these briefs and they do support well!  One problem is the difficulty with the fly...hard to get open and makes the going just a tad-bit difficult at times.  Otherwise, shorts are well-made to last and support as advertised with the string tie."
4.0,This dress shows your curves nicely. Im not a fan of the material. It is rather cheap feeling. Not sure how it will wash and wear.
4.0,I like the color and the three rows of gold.  I wish the toe ring had not been adjustable because that usually causes some small discomfort; this is not a deal changer.
4.0,"My only complaint is the weight.  I believe the intention is that you are able to throw this around (at your TV) without much fear of damage, but this is heavy enough that my husband and I aren't comfortable throwing them at the TV."
4.0,it's nice and exactly like on the picture.
4.0,Exactly as described.  Lenses work well.
4.0,"Very beautiful wallet and great quality just to cute, but the cellphone compartment is to short. My phone is to long not able to  Fasten the flap on the phone compartment area. It will only fit if I take my phone case off and that will not be safe. If I  Accidentally drop my phone while pulling it out the slot and break my cellphone.  Not worth it to take that kind of chance, I will be returning the item."
4.0,Husband  really loved this and my teenage son is wanting one now great material
4.0,fits a little snug
4.0,Fits in the waist too big on the top area. Will see if I can fix it unless they want to offer to replace it before I try. Otherwise unless you have bigger then a 36C I‚Äôd try the smallest size first.
4.0,"The product arrived in excellent condition with a storage bag in a very nice sealed box. Was delivered promptly. The belt is a little narrower than I expected between the top of the fabric to the bottom of the dangling bits it is only about a foot wide but I assume that my surprise is due to my lack of reading descriptions better. otherwise, it is a lovely item and the quality I expected."
4.0,"Shirt is almost true to size, the length and width is a little bit smaller than usual mainly the length. The sleeves are perfect. The color is just like the picture it‚Äôs amazing! I would definitely buy this again!"
4.0,"Nicely designed and well made, this ring fits quite well.  I like it."
4.0,"I like this shirt! It is very casual but it can be dressed up. The fabric looks different then on the picture though, the material isn‚Äôt as cozy looking. But I still like it!! I got a medium so it would be more loose. I think a slightly tighter fit would be cuter with this fabric."
4.0,"These socks are super cute!  They are a little tight around the calf for me, but otherwise they fit well.  They are a tiny bit scratchy, but I'm pretty sure that will go away once they've been worn and washed with fabric softener a few times."
4.0,GANADARA Chunky Small Hoop Earrings for Women are very nice. I did not realize just how small they are; they are minimal.  They are beautiful but small.
4.0,"I love my Birks! I have wide feet and also need arch support.  I also love the bright summery color- and have gotten many compliments. They are comfortable, fashionable, and healthy for my feet."
4.0,Love this top! Fits well I‚Äôm 5foot3 150 pounds I got a medium
4.0,Comfortable. Good for the money.  Could be finished a bit better.
4.0,Cute shorts but ran small. Had to send back.
4.0,"I have the black pair which I wear for work, since I stand all day and on hard surfaces.  I like the feel of them.  They are soft and feel great on.  BUT they are really long.  I have to fold the top over which makes it a little too tight.  I'm hoping with some wear, the top will loosen up a bit.  I'm 5'6"" and ordered a small."
4.0,"Why make a fine product, use a great fabric and expertly tailor a garment -- then purposely mislabel the size? Damn, man. It's like you're only after my money."
4.0,Only one of them didn‚Äôt work it wouldn‚Äôt adjust
4.0,"Very lovely dress, my daughter loves it.."
4.0,cheaply made but cute
4.0,"Although they are not optical grade lenses, they do quite well. I get very painful headaches in the bright sunny days. These do very well in shielding the rays. They are not so dark that every one wonders where you are looking. Nice fit, light and definitely not too dark to wear most days. A recommended pair !"
4.0,"arrived as described and on time, runs large"
4.0,I like it so far been using it for two months now.
4.0,"Fits nice and snug against skin. No worries about it slipping off that's for sure. It looks great and feels nice. My sister is excited to wear this with her costume!  But it isn't stretchy, so if you have bigger arms or hands it probably won't fit."
4.0,"Material thin, but cute with jeans."
4.0,"I love these! They are exactly what I need. They are basically invisible, which is perfect for when I am at work. They sit flat against my nose, and unless you are like 3 inches from my face, you can't see them. I wouldn't necessarily wear them to bed because I'm afraid it'd fall out and disappear, but they are perfect for wearing during the day."
4.0,"This is definitely not leather, not sure what it is but it‚Äôs not leather. Feels much cheaper, but I‚Äôm not complaining because I wasn‚Äôt expecting much and this exceeded my expectations. Looks very nice and I get compliments on it all the time. Giving it 4 stars just because of misleading description."
4.0,"Exactly as shown,,,, great not bad at all for the price."
4.0,Doesn't match picture.
4.0,The only issue I have with these is the cost. I'd love to have a drawer full of them!
4.0,"These are gloves for chilly weather - think above freezing, but chilly enough that you still want to protect your hands a bit on a chilly fall or spring day.  These are not gloves for sub-zero temperatures or that will keep you very warm on really cold days.<br /><br />With that in mind, they are great gloves.  I have bought this style of gloves from Isotoner regularly over the last few years and I am happy with this pair as well.  They do the job, they are comfortable, they look good and I love that I can remove the mitten top to free up my fingers when I am looking for my house keys."
4.0,"Cute, but shoulder ribbons are in awkward location and the shirt is very small. Bought it as a gift and she loved the shirt, but it was very snug. Ordered it according to size chart and it was still small."
4.0,"A bit shorter than I'd like, but very comfy."
4.0,Is beautiful this dress but coming in large size.
4.0,I got them fast after the purchase. The tumbled green quartz crystals I received are big
4.0,The quality was as expected for the price but I am returning it because it was just too big. I am 5'4&#34; 180 pounds and the Large was baggy.
4.0,Just as full as the picture. Nice and light.
4.0,Bracelet was received and still intact.
4.0,"Love it. Looks great,just like the picture. Only wish it was one long solid piece of leather that i could slip over my head, instead of having a clasp."
4.0,Super cute top. The only thing is that it feels a little awkward... I feel like I can't really move without the top slipping over my shoulders. I suck it up because it looks so cute!
4.0,I like this dainty bracelet. It's shiny and feminine. I took one star away since it turns constantly from the weight of the stones. They could have balanced it out with a bead on the end of the chain....but I still like it!
4.0,"Comfy, well made.  Love the feel. Little difficult to breath throw, but better than average cloth masks"
4.0,Not really what I expected. They are to small and they look a lititle to girly for a boy.
4.0,"The telescoping wings was a great idea to alter the costume to a simple cape or for ""wings"".  This was to be a great Halloween ""safety"" costume to be seen in a distance while walking my neighbor kids.  Unfortunately, the circuit disconnected after about 5 minutes of wearing and we couldn't figure out how to quickly repair.  The vendor refunded my money.  I'll look for their products again, but will test out long before Halloween night!"
4.0,I really like the pants they do run a little small but feel really go on
4.0,"I used Rit fabric dye and dyed the white laces navy blue to match my shoes.  the sizing is accurate, but the laces were slightly different lengths."
4.0,Sent as a give they liked very much.
4.0,Thin as in bend over see through. They were loose and stretchy so I would suggest a size down.
4.0,Average warm. Used on motorcycle and snowboarding. Temps around freezing. Bulky and the charge lasts about 4 hours on high. Good winter bike gloves. Who rides more than 4 hours in the winter when it‚Äôs freezing.
4.0,"The only gripe I have (besides the over-large size) is that there is not enough contrast between the hands and the face... the white hands blend in too easily with the white face, making the hands not super easy to see at a quick glance."
4.0,"Elegant watch, looks sleek and stylish"
4.0,Love this shirt with leggings!
4.0,"Bought for my nephew.  The hoodie is stylish and lightweight.  It‚Äôs a smallish 3x, but still did fit."
4.0,Cute and soft but thinking I should have gotten a small rather than a medium. Still love it.
4.0,The plastic is bad the company changed plastic recommend looking more strongly plastic
4.0,I love silver these are simply gorgeous üòç
4.0,The color was very pretty and the dress was nice but it was super long and the pockets hit right at my hips which made my hips look very bulgy.  It would probably look very nice on someone that was very tall and the pockets would be a little higher up on a taller person
4.0,"I woukd have given all 5 stars but the quote is a bit hard to read. I got it in my sticking today, great locket :) big chunky, and able to fit pictures easy as pie!!!"
4.0,Nice fabric but get a size bigger because it runs small.i usually wear medium in all tops but this was tight on my chest area.
4.0,"Nice and thin, perfect for when you're a sensible human being without a ton of s*** to put in your wallet. The leather doesn't feel real, but I can't say for a fact that it isn't. The small logo button is a bit awkward, but it lets me know which way I've got my wallet in my pocket. I don't trust anything to the outside back pocket, it's much too loose for any valuables. All things considered, I like it."
4.0,I was sent the wrong size
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter knowing it would just be worn as a decorative piece. I liked the design and was actually surprised that the quality was a little better than I expected. Not extra fancy or anything, but it doesn't have any odd bumps or weird misshapen parts like you might find in a lot of similar costume jewelry. The phoenix part looks exactly like the picture in the listing. The chain is a pretty basic and inexpensive chain. Again, I wasn't expecting much, but it did have a part that seemed to be kind of stuck. Once I wiggled it a little, it loosened up and I couldn't even find that part again so no worries there.  The only issue I have with any of it (and the reason I took away one star) is that the design connects to the chain through a small loop in the back. I'm not sure if it's the angle or the chain or what it is, but it doesn't necessarily hang very easily because of it. It's pretty lightweight so if the chain slips to the side while you're wearing it, it may hang a little crooked. Not a big deal, but something I noticed. Otherwise, it's cute and a fun piece."
4.0,"Love the fabric, very comfortable"
4.0,"I wore this as a maternity dress so it was short short. The sheer part of the dress was long but the inner skirt was short. Even if I wasn't pregnant, it was short at the back."
4.0,"I purchased the purple floral long sleeve option. Overall, it's a very cute shirt. The flowers are a little brighter than they appear in the picture but it doesn't look bad. I'm usually a size 8 and ordered medium and it fits but is on the looser side so I could have sized down. The fabric does not seem like a normal cotton. It is very soft and has a slight sheen to it, almost like a fine jersey knit mixed with microfiber. It is not see through which is nice. So far it seems like good quality and I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Way too small.<br /><br />Edit: 9/30/16 while too small I gifted it to someone who could wear it. I upped the stars as the customer service was great.
4.0,"Very cute.  Very authentic looking.  They are just perfect when you don't want to show off, but want to look well dressed."
4.0,Very soft material like Lularoe leggings. Generous cut. Very stretchy. Seems almost true to size but slightly larger.
4.0,Good dress but the size did not fit well for me
4.0,I was looking for a pair of earrings to match my bluejeans mask this will fit it is very beautiful the only drawback is that it is too heavy.
4.0,"High quality product! The large is hard to slip over my shoulder pads. I‚Äôm 5 foot nine, 180 pounds. I wish I went with an XL."
4.0,This product was comfortable even with my pregnant swollen. I do wish it was flatter since the slightest height have me feeling topsy turvy.
4.0,"Comfy. But as all other Hanes women's tops, too short. Only hits me barely at the waist and ordered a size up. I'm not even tall or particularly long torsoed. Lighter purple than pictured too, but still a cute color."
4.0,"There are many terms for fashionable neck wraps.  You have scarfs, shawls, wraps and stoles. I‚Äôd call this a muffler.  It‚Äôs short and has a ready-made slot to fit one side through the other so you don‚Äôt have to rely on fancy tying techniques.  It‚Äôs warm and snuggly and fun.  I‚Äôve always loved neck wraps for their versatility ‚Äì you can change a look completely for very little investment.  This Orchard Row faux fur muffler is a fun accessory."
4.0,"Not too big not too small, look good"
4.0,The glasses are decent and stylish but they are VERY small! I bought these for my 7 year old and they do not fit. I will be giving them to my 5 year old instead.
4.0,Cute Christmas jams. Thin but cute.
4.0,"Fit was good, wasn‚Äôt as high waisted as I like but but it‚Äôs acceptable and they are cute. The strings are a little long and annoying against my legs but that‚Äôs probably just me."
4.0,"Small but economical to put into your pants, coat pocket and go. Doesn't hold much but if you use it for those errand runs it the perfect wallet to have."
4.0,Pretty. Loved the toggles. Arrived quickly. Purchased 2
4.0,Product is good quality! Arrived promptly
4.0,"I purchased several pendants from major religions to keep in my car. If I ever come upon an accident, such a symbol might prove to be a great comfort to an injured or upset person. The medallion is very dignified and I hope it will be welcomed by a believer of this faith."
4.0,Wish the cotton was softer. But I like it.
4.0,Cute and light.....just what I wanted
4.0,"These are nice, well made, I think. They were a bit (lot) on the small side initially. Like nose-flattening tight. SO the hubby gave them a real good stretching out - worth mentioning that they held up to the abuse - and now he uses them daily. Happy ending."
4.0,"Very pretty, simple light weight dangle earrings....You can dress them up or down....."
4.0,I would like a lower leg and tighter band on it but I like these compared to others
4.0,"I'm writing this to help women between size 8-10 in dresses. I'm 5.6ft, 150lb, bust 38d, waist 30inch. I ordered L, and it fits slightly roomy. I think M would be tight yet this stretches. Pick the size according to your taste."
4.0,"Very nice looking hat, runs a tad on the smaller size.  Fits me at 5'1 but not my husband at 5'10.  Received sooner than expected."
4.0,"The product is great. The added bonus for us were the filters, but well like some of the previous buyers shared...these run small. My eight year old wasn‚Äôt able to wear it comfortably on his face. He‚Äôs thin, and I assumed because he‚Äôs thin it‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt be an issue; however when wearing the gaiter it was so tight it began to put lines under his eyes, and he was only wearing it for a few minutes. If we added the ear loops it would have made the tightness worst. I gave these to his little sister and it fits her perfectly! Still worth buying, keep in mind these are not for an older child 8 and up."
4.0,great soft alpaca
4.0,"I love the look & feel of the shirt, but it's just a little small, and a little short in the body. After washing, I give it a good stretch, and it fits about right. I don't suggest a dryer after washing. After washing IN COLD WATER, give it a good top to bottom stretch & hang it to dry. It will be just about right."
4.0,Very neat looking necklace. As others have noted a touch difficult to maintain forward. But manageable. Great quality nice design. Detail awesome.
4.0,For the wife. She wears rainbows all day so these are a slight upgrade. She loves them so there you go.
4.0,beautiful rings
4.0,"This shirt is beautifully crafted and I would love to give this 5 stars.  However, the colors are drab in comparison to the website photo."
4.0,I use these to cover my wrist tatoo t work. This one fits too loose on me so it would be a good fit for a larger person. One side is stretch the other is fleece. It has a small binding on one end making it look like a cut off end of a fleece jacket. Neither negative or positive on that.
4.0,"The material is not what I expected and was a bit unflattering in the tummy area. However, with some shapewear, everything looked fine.<br /> I didn‚Äôt think the dress looked like how it did on the model, but it ended up working well for what I needed it for."
4.0,Pretty good. Worth the money. Little clearer lens would be good but can't complain about the value
4.0,"Very cute, lightweight, good value"
4.0,"bow  tie, hair, and nose were all elementary school aged child size appropriate. However, the vest was rather large for a child. Other than that the product is great and other pieces were as expected."
4.0,"I love this watch band!! It's adorable and comfortable enough to sleep in, unlike the silicone one that came with my Samsung Gear 2. I had to get adapters to make it work with the clips on my watch, but that was no big deal.<br />The ONLY thing I don't like, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the pattern isn't lined up very well and most of the little dinosaurs are cut in half. You can still tell what it is if you look closely, but I wish it was a little better aligned."
4.0,"I wear a medium or around an 8 in most  dresses.This dress fit perfectly right out of the box! It's a stiff material and seems like it could be a bit warm to wear during the summer but it is stretchy and comfortable. The zipper was easy to zip up, no catching or anything. Dress falls right at the knees which was the perfect length for me. I like the pleating around the collar, excited to wear this dress as a bridesmaid in a couple weeks!"
4.0,"Really nice sweater. The construction appears to be on point. I think this style is really for a small-busted, petite woman. I have a large bust and it just didn't hang well on me. The color is nice as well, just as pictured."
4.0,Beautiful top bit the bottom is small. Almost didn't fit
4.0,"I'm giving this four stars because I know it didn't fit to my liking however the fabric was great , the cut was great , design was great ...definitely order a size up ladies.. Exchanged for a bigger size because these pants have potential lol"
4.0,"You get what you pay for and the band fell apart on one side where it connects to the watch face within 10 minutes of putting it on making it a pocket watch until I could get to my room so I fix it. But I wasn‚Äôt looking for a timex or better. I wanted a watch that would keep time, which it does. I wanted a watch who‚Äôs face I could read without my glasses, which it has and I can."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable.  I used it as a mask to go over my blue mask.
4.0,"I like this blouse. The only issue is when washing it, the fabric is not as expected.I washed in cold, delicate.Either case, I like the length and the 3/4 sleeves and am looking at others in this pattern/style."
4.0,Was perfect for what we needed them for
4.0,"pretty cute, quality is not bad"
4.0,I ordered this for my son.  He liked the way it fit and liked the dry wicking material as well.  I liked the pattern in the picture but In Person he didn't like it.  I would suggest that if you are ordering for someone get their opinion.
4.0,Form fitting with stretch. Will show every curve for better or worse
4.0,These are great! Very soft and fit perfectly!
4.0,"I absolutely love this jumper! The sleeves are a little short, but other than that, it's great."
4.0,They were the perfect addition to my daughters costume
4.0,"So far I've received a few compliments on this hat each time I wear it. Love expressing my Slytherin Pride, in good quality without it being the same thing everyone else has. I do wish it were flex fit instead of snap back, but that's a personal preference."
4.0,"Super cute shirt. Love the fit of it, but I wish it was longer. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and needed a little more length. I like my tops to go past my pants zipper."
4.0,Love the classic line of this watch.
4.0,The tabs are too long when you tighten them. They stick out and being lined with Velcro it ketches on other clothing
4.0,"It's a really soft fabric, but it fits a little large to size, but with a cute belt it shapes well your figure."
4.0,"These still give way to hot spots. I am a woman's 11-12 shoe size and they fit perfectly and have enough height on the ankles to not slide down like other brands, but they are still made out of the wrong material for running. We wear these when we are just walking in our toe shoes, but I try to stick to strictly wool blends now when running with shoes."
4.0,"I like this product. My only complaint is that it says one size fits all, but when I received it the tag inside said XXL. Also it is a little big for me as I would prefer it to be a little tighter. I am a size 6/8.  I still use the product as I am currently 5 weeks post delivery."
4.0,I have enjoyed these and I get a lot of compliments. They help me feel warm without all the bulk.<br /><br />Enjoy!
4.0,Eh kinda tight but I love it
4.0,"The face covering scarf is as described and will do, but on the front a mostly blank-space section of the pattern shows the most, not so much the pretty leaf pattern - too bad."
4.0,I have to wear hats to keep my head from getting sunburned. This hat fits that purpose perfectly.
4.0,"Built very sturdy, but MUCH smaller than expected. Not sure how an 11-inch tablet would fit in this! Used it as an alternative diaper bag for quick trips into the store. Could barely fit a couple diapers and a bag of wipes. There are several pockets on the inside and sides, but I'm not able to use them because of the bulkiness of the diapers. Bummer, I was really looking forward to this! Make sure you READ the SIZE DESCRIPTION!!"
4.0,"BIG fan.  Big fan of this.  I ordered the largest size possible, which meant I could only get this in green.  I have a fear of receiving small sizes.  Don't know about this company, but &#34;Asian sizes&#34; is apparently a thing.<br />So I LOVE the feel and fit!  The only flaw with my method ordering this shirt is the neck opening is too large on me.  Soooo my bra strap shows...<br />But really, if you are a woman, you know in the scheme of things this is not a big thing.<br />Back to the pluses: long sleeves, COZY fabric.  My constant issue is sleeves are not long enough, shirts are not long enough, (pant legs are not long enough...) Really I like my tush covered, I like to reach up without exposing myself, etc.  Most clothes that are long enough are too wide like WIDE and I hear words like &#34;swimming in it&#34;/ baggy/ &#34;too big for you&#34;, etc.<br />BUT I would not categorise this as a *dress* in any way. The bottom of this hits much higher on me than is shown in the picture.  Plus the bottom of this product is too free flowing to be sure &#34;down there&#34; remains covered.<br />I wore it over leggings, under a open cardigan sweater and scarf and it was fab.  The top didn't bunch under other clothes, the bottom didn't bunch as i walked.<br /> While this piece might suit someone wider than I, any extra &#34;wide&#34; fabric doesn't show and also doesn't bunch under clothes. ALSO it doesn't bunch under clothes!  It bears repeating.  This is solid fabric that I feel covered in but also pairs well with outer layers since it is winter here. I guess that is my basic style: layers.  So with my scarf, and cardigan, and leggings, and boots and....  It is a really good piece for my wardrobe.  OH and the asymmetrical bottom hem: Love it.  It's hardly noticeable in an understated way. Currently my pet peeve it the blunt flat hem.  I AM curved - i want to be covered here, but not there, etc  I don't think I am asking too much for the same in my clothes."
4.0,I love this outfit for the most part however the tank seems a little small and binding. Not a huge deal but if you are like me‚ÄîI dislike the compressed feeling that I got from this tank. The pants and jacket are great and fit well. I took off one star for the tank but had it been a little less compressive then I would have given five stars.
4.0,Its not quite as deep red as it looks but i still love this sweater.
4.0,But even the dark black part is see threw so be award your dick will be showing ;)
4.0,"Excellent product, but runs small. My chest measures 46&#34;....the size chart says XL fits 46 - 48. Ordered the XL....it was 2 inches too small. Returned for an XXL."
4.0,"Really cute watch but I returned it when I saw it was too large to fit a six year old.  Also, was afraid it wouldn't hold up well for an active child, especially when washing her hands, etc.  Opted for a less expensive, light up LOL watch and she loves it, fits perfect on her little wrist."
4.0,Very pretty charm bracelet but the clasp is hard to open and is not functional
4.0,Was larger than I expected but a very decent bag
4.0,this is beautiful  material and very well made just a bit smaller than described
4.0,"The shirt is warm, good quality, and fit as expected.  My only issue with this shirt is that it was very mildly scratchy on the inside of the shirt where the seams are."
4.0,"I like it, but cannot wear it.  They aren't kidding with the for &#34;small head/kids&#34; description.  I'm only 5'3&#34;, but it would NOT go on my head.  Luckily, I have a friend who is 4'11 and maybe at most wears a size 2... I'll just give it to her and keep looking for one for me."
4.0,Theses are perfect for when you are allergic and lose your original gold backing
4.0,Ordered for my husband for a family event. It was a little to small. He was able to wear it but the sleeves were short
4.0,"Beautiful but run at least a half size too large, so these are going back. For reference I‚Äôm a true size 7B. Aside from running long in length, the ankle opening is large as well and made my feet look huge. Debating if reordering a half size down will fix the fit issues."
4.0,Loved how comfortable and flattering this pants fit me.
4.0,Love them need stretch lining
4.0,Gloves arrived as advertised.
4.0,"I thought they felt ok, but my daughter didn't like them. She has SPD. Still have an ok review since it isn't their fault."
4.0,"My waist isn't as thin as it used to be, and in fairness this skirt fit fine, but the cut of it was not as flattering as I was hoping for.<br />The material is very smooth and shiny with even, small pleats - but the cut isn't as full as I was expecting, and the length (just above mid calf on me) not long enough to look good with a long, draping top - making it less flattering to a fuller figure."
4.0,"I'm 5'10 with a 26 inch waist, I ordered a small and it fits great.  I was first skeptical as to if I should order a small, but glad I did because it isn't even fitted.  The one thing that I would say is different from the picture would be the neckline.  The neckline isn't wide.  You get what you pay for, but I feel this exceeded my expectations."
4.0,"Material is very thin and see through. Something I would probably wear at the beach over a swimsuit on a cool day. My weight fluctuates between 170 and 180 lbs. I ordered a large and there was lots of room. I should have ordered a medium. Even after washing, the pants are the same size. Did not shrink. The top is small. It fit perfectly. But wearing both pieces together was not a great look, unless I just want to have my belly all the way out at all times."
4.0,I like the softness in the material.  The fit is great except that for me the length is like 3-4‚Äù too long as I am only 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall.
4.0,Proportions are a little off but nothing major.
4.0,"When people said it will not fit right if your breats are to big, they weren't kidding. Still fits pretty well regardless!! can't wait to wear it!!!!!"
4.0,"Nice cuff, ends are sharp. But still a nice wide cuff"
4.0,"Worth the money. Now I can keep my readers on me instead of a pocket, where they inevitably will fall out. Sailing over the weekend and kept my sun glasses in place. They slide onto the ear piece with no issues and hold well. Really like the adjustment slides to make the fit perfect."
4.0,Love them but wish they were a bit longer
4.0,"Fits ok, somewhat large and longer than expected. It should work fine, is very soft, but thinner than advertised so you do get some showing of your underwear."
4.0,"Nice and simple design, great for anything! They are not form fitting and get really loose throughout the day."
4.0,"Simple, affordable, good for traveling."
4.0,"This is such a cute watch band and I was so excited to use it because it looked so comfortable. But it was the opposite unfortunately :( I have pretty small wrists and even after wearing it for a couple weeks everyday, all day...it‚Äôs still so tight it leaves a ridiculous indent on my wrist...still cute and doesn‚Äôt seem to bother me much anymore until I take it off and feel the relief."
4.0,"A little snug for the sizing (and I followed other reviews), but it worked great for a one day pirate themed event. The zipper pull broke on first wear though, but it suited the purpose and was otherwise good quality for the price."
4.0,"I like it, the  material feels nice, I bought it as a night shirt but it is too tight in the arms and chest. It is also very short in the front.  I normally wear a large in anything, this is the exception. The size chart is inaccurate,  I like it enough that I am returning the large and reordering it in xlarge - I hope that works.<br />I received the xlarge - the arms are still too tight and it still feels tight across the chest. Such a shame because it really feels nice on. It's big everywhere else. In all the other areas the large was just fine my arms aren't huge I have 14&quot; biceps fairly normal for a girl who wears a large. so just beware and again if you are looking to wear this as a dress, it is short!! much better with leggings."
4.0,"The head was a bit tight on my SO (this was meant for him), but it fit me and I'll wear it."
4.0,this is the cutest swimsuit and the quality of the fabric is great.  it does fit a little large though
4.0,"Felt great on. Very nice fabric. I got white and you can see the cups its not very flattering because of that. In white, I'm sure the darker colors are great"
4.0,"5 foot 145, I got a small and it's kinda big."
4.0,It's roomy and light.  The strap is nice and secure with front pocket for phone.  Bought one for me to use for the gym or travel and one for my dad to use.
4.0,Fedex is the worst shipmment method ever
4.0,My son loves these.  Just know that there is next to no arch support.
4.0,"Camiseta de tama√±o apropiado para la talla. Tela y estampado de calidad promedio, nada que merezca destacarse"
4.0,"If I could give it a 3.5, I would. I got a large because of the reviews saying it was tight in the arms. It fits like the pic exactly (5' 7&#34; 130lb) what I didn't realize is that the shirt is wide at the bottom, so it kinda flares out at the hip area. If you see in the pic you can tell what I mean.. but w/out having ordered & seen it, I never would have picked up on that fact.. considering returning...otherwise a decent sweater/shirt. Also slightly see-thru & thin-ish material but still nice."
4.0,"+ It fit! (I was a bit nervous about the size measurements, as I don‚Äôt always measure ‚Äútrue‚Äù to the sizing charts, but this one fits and is NOT overly big, but is not snug-tight.)<br />+ I personally appreciate the material combination<br />+ Works super great as a windbreaker/outer shell.<br />+ Works great in light rain and kept me dry the several times I‚Äôve worn it out so far. Water repellant feature ‚Äúworks.‚Äù :)<br />+ Wrist closures are not so tight one cannot wear over gloves (I‚Äôve used while wearing running gloves underneath,) but not so loose that the slip up over the forearm.<br />+ Whether won as-is or with a *light* layer underneath, the material and overall jacket feel is breathable.<br />+ Even though I‚Äôve not had this jacket for an extensive period of time as I write this review, it has proven durable and the overall feel of the jacket - both material and wearability factor - give me great confidence in the durability of the product.<br /><br />+/- While the primary purpose is not a rain slicker, I did wear it out in the rain a few times (three, I think(?)) just to test it out and see how it fared (I also didn‚Äôt go far for this reason.) The first time it seemed work alright in the light rain, but it does NOT work well for more extensive period out in the rain, light or heavy. It doesn‚Äôt entirely soak through, but there is that wetness feel and overall heaviness from being saturated; thus, it drips some when removing, then dampening the wear-er, some.<br />+/- Hood stays on nice and secure when drawstrings are adjusted, but I personally find them a bit awkward and not as easy to tighten or loosen with gloves on (so when you go running or hiking and are wearing gloves, buyer be forewarned it might take a little extra creative effort.)<br />+/- Hood also causes an awkward reduced field of vision (beyond a normal reduction because one is wearing a hood.) Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the shape of my head or how I had the drawstrings adjusted, but I found it‚Ä¶just a bit awkward.<br /><br />- Would NOT recommend this as a ‚Äúlayer‚Äù for warmth specifically. I‚Äôve worn a light sweater/hoodie underneath and it didn‚Äôt really help keep in any warmth of that light hoodie. (i.e. layering didn‚Äôt work in this case. I was warmer in the wet cold with a fleece zip-up hoodie more than in two light layers involving this jacket.<br />- Zipper was rather cumbersome to work after I unzipped it from the original packaging and slipped it on to test if the sizing was adequate. Took several (not quite a dozen times) to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù the zipper to easily use it.<br />*27 November 2020<br />_________________________________________________<br /><br />Additional note: I put it through the wash ONCE on a gentle (or so I thought,) cycle & the drawstring to the hood on the left side broke. It still works, thankfully, but there is NOT the same tension and ability to close/tighten the hood as before. BTW: I let it hang dry. I did NOT put it through the dryer nor would I recommend it."
4.0,It's fun and colorful.  The band part isn't tight on your head if you wear it for a long time.
4.0,Beautiful and so fun! Looks exactly as pictured. I‚Äôm only giving 4 stars because the backings are terrible and I had to poke a hole in one because it was closed. You could easily use your own
4.0,It is a cute lanyard ID holder but it covers a lot of my information on my badge I work at an airport don't recommend for you guys you will keep taking your badge out but for others it's a keepers.
4.0,She liked dressing up for her birthday! The sash was too much to keep on while playing. Washed well. It fit okay but I‚Äôm glad I sized up one.
4.0,"I need the warmth, so that's why I purchased Chillys Crewneck Thermal.  The problem was that its a little tight, guess I need to lose some weight."
4.0,"I like this band - it's very clearly not leather, and I don't know how long it will last, but it looks nice and seems like a fair quality for the price."
4.0,"Nice casual dress, fits as expected and priced reasonably for the quality. No ironing needed."
4.0,It work well but after 7 hours they begin to roll down.
4.0,It was too small but fit my 12 year old daughter !
4.0,This was a perfect choice for the graduation bracelet I made.  The size and shape was very nice and her name was perfectly written.  It was nice to add this to the bracelet.
4.0,This is soft and warm! Perfect for my 7 year old
4.0,"They appear bigger in the picture. But overall I'm satisfied with the chain. It IS adjustable if you need to shorten it. The quality is pretty decent and the chain worked for what I needed it to do. Delivered on time, if you're looking for a quick replacement chain for that pendant you oh-so-love then these will suffice I'd say. I bought one for myself and one for a family member."
4.0,"Scout Boot Care is my favorite Shoe Polish/Protector/Shiner/Cleaner. I found this manufacturer in a Trading post across the street. Loved it the first time i used them on my shoes. Easy Application. No Mess. Easy maintenance henceforth. Since most of my shoes are distressed leather, The &#34;Water & Stain Protect Spray&#34; and &#34;Distressed Leather Conditioner&#34; are the only ones i buy and they do a perfect job on them"
4.0,"I read reviews before ordering, luckily. I ordered a 2X when I normally wear a Large. The 2X fits perfectly, with no room for being any tighter. I would highly recommend ordering two sizes up as mentioned in previous comments. Material is Very spandex like, And not thin, which I like. Zipper seems as if it may be fragile, but for now it‚Äôs held up just fine (one day wear). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 220lbs athletic build, anyone near that ball park should probably order a 2X."
4.0,Cute for Halloween for school.
4.0,"The socks looked kind of thin and cheap, but once I wore them I was pleasantly surprised. They fit well and are very comfortable. So far they are holding up fine too. A nice basic bamboo sock for a great price!"
4.0,My husband bought this product and wears it every time he goes out into the cold weather.  It fits and looks good on him.  Seems to be good quality.
4.0,"This was somewhat small, but i'm giving it a 4 becuase of the customer service and design. It will fit best if you have a slim face"
4.0,They're cute. Much smaller than I thought. Small like studs but bright colors. Delivery was also quicker than expected for standard delivery
4.0,"I love this!! It is so soft and comfortable, it looks great and both the shirt and shorts are the perfect length. Also great because they can be worn separately. My only downside is the butterfly on the shirt looks like a plastic iron on, still cute though."
4.0,Super pleased with how it looks and feels. The drawstring in the back was kind of weird so I decided to cut mine. Other than that I like it a lot.
4.0,Bellos! Pero s√∫per grandes
4.0,They are beautiful!!! Match with so many things.
4.0,Size works perfectly
4.0,Waist size 37~38 6'0&#34; and they fit nicely. Shipped fast. The only Con I would say is they buttons on the front have no purpose an come off pretty easy
4.0,"Very cute, be sure you are accurate when ordering your size. Seems to me they run a  bit small.<br />But very cute."
4.0,I purchased this shirt to add a layer of warmth while snorkeling in Hawaii. It allowed me to stay out in the water longer as I get chilled easily. I ordered 2 sizes up as the waist was too tight. It served my purposes and will be a part of my beach gear for tropical vacations.
4.0,Pretty top - runs just a little big -
4.0,"Great shirt, but just order for unisex sizing. Nice fabric, no shrinking."
4.0,"My child and I like the very soft material. My child liked the super soft material so much that I did not return it. The arms are very short and I bought 2 sizes larger. My child is short and has never had a problem with arm length in clothes. I choose to buy it larger so he could use it for a longer time. He length of the robe is slightly below his knees, so this is ok. It has a good which he likes. My child is very thin and the body of the robe fits him fine but a thicker child would not have enough room to grow in it. Over all I like the product but wish it was truer to an American size. I also wish the size charts could be split up depending on region to make it easier to determine your child‚Äôs size. So beware that you may want to order it 3-4 sizes larger than what you need depending on your child‚Äôs overall size."
4.0,"Nice bag handles are a little short to be able to put on my shoulder with towel in it, and definetly smaller top part then expected but overall I would buy again"
4.0,It's beautiful but the international sizing is wrong by several sizes.  I had to order three of them before I got my size.  They are so beautiful though that I just gave my friends the other ones.
4.0,I bought this for a performance before a con the seller was so nice and very helpful about seeing if the product would come in time and helps out in general. The costume itself was stunning. I am usually a M/L (US size) so i got a L because there wasn't any reviews at the time so bigger is better in my opinion when i got it the skirt kept falling the skirt part is a a stomach to skirt part and it didn't work (it kept falling down) so we had to safety-pin/sew it to the shirt. i could've got a smaller size to be honest. The costume also did not come with the scrunchie so we made the hair piece with ribbon and it worked fine. The wig it came with is definitely too pink and had to be styled so much. so id recommend getting a different wig if possible if you order from this place but the costume is awesome so id recommend them 8/10
4.0,It is usefull for driving.
4.0,Cute and got lots of compliments. Clasp is fragile.
4.0,"The sweater is soft and comfortable, it is not as oversized as the model is showing unless you order up a size. I'm a large and that's what I ordered and wish they had an extra large to size up to as it would have been a more oversized look which is what I wanted. The color is not even close to what is shown - I order the beige which looks like a cream in the picture but the color is like a burlap."
4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised! I got this in the mail and then wore it out for a long walk in the rain the next day. Most rain jackets that I have had in the past require waterproofing spray but the water bounced right off and it was comfortable. The only thing I wished it had was inside pockets, but for the price, this is a bargain."
4.0,"Just enough hold without compromising natural feel and shape.<br /><br />Extremely comfortable.<br /><br />Lacework isn't done well, has been fraying since I removed these from the packaging - but the items are super cheap so no big deal.<br /><br />I also love that I'm wearing a cami without having all that extra fabric to tuck in as one normally would with normal cami tops."
4.0,Great product. Fits and worked perfectly
4.0,Good product. Might need hand wash for the delicate fabric. These can pass off as no show socks for a lot of sandals ..the colors are vibrant.
4.0,Silly indulgence ... sometimes I feel ugly.
4.0,"I like, but they seem to be a bit cheaply made.  So far they have held up good, so I will have to see how they fair in the future!"
4.0,This is a very cute top but the material could be a tad bit softer.
4.0,"Super comfortable & professional looking pants! The only thing I personally don‚Äôt like is it has really deep pockets, but I know that would be considered a pro rather than a con for some."
4.0,I like the fit and shading but the real test will come over the summer.
4.0,"I love this shirt, any Buick Lover will love this shirt...<br /><br />The reason why I didn't give it a 5 Star Rating is because the shirt doesn't have a GSX or a Boattail Riviera on it...<br />Any Buick Shirt MUST have a GSX, a GNX, a Boattail Riviera and the Buickiful Five's, 1954 - 1957 Buick's...<br /><br />The shirt fits good, the 3XL fits nice, it's not to big or to small and it gives me ""room"" to move..<br />The length is good and the shirt looks well made...<br /><br />I look forward to wearing this Buickiful Buick Shirt on the 1st Buickiful Day of Spring!!!<br /><br />."
4.0,The quality is good and they hold up well.  They are on the bigger side for a baby under 6 months or so. I wish the designs were less cartoony.
4.0,No specific likes or dislikes. It's perfect to switch it up and is cheap enough to do it.
4.0,"This sweater is soft and of good quality. Only complaint may be just my perception.... this sweater is rather thin, good for spring or early fall. I was expecting a heavier knit, but it is comfortable, pretty, and layers well. Pockets are great as long as the contents aren't heavy."
4.0,I am a size 14/16 and I ordered a 2XL and it was larger than expected. But I love the quality of the fabric and I received lot's of compliments.
4.0,"Love how it looks but the pole needs to be longer, it got to be too tight for me, otherwise it‚Äôs cute"
4.0,As the title says these are nice goggles. They seal nicely around my eyes and give me a nice clear view underwater. I don't know what else to say because most goggles do the same thing. They are pretty solid and look as if they will last me a long time!
4.0,"I returned this dress only because I needed a dress for a wedding I'm in and this wasn't quite the right style. I liked the stretchiness because it hugs the body, but doesn't suffocate. It would be great for church or other such event. I didn't know what to do with the tie part though."
4.0,"This is very nice, but beware, if you react to copper, it will make a copper ring around your wrist. It is very nice."
4.0,"The wrist band is a bit thick, but the product fit perfectly on my 3 year olds hands."
4.0,Nice piece but it needs to be a little longer. I guess I have a fatter neck than others so I will need to extend about 2inches or so
4.0,"Comfy and classy, but for the life of me I can't get them to sit just straight..."
4.0,In the ads this is shown to have buttons down the back waist. This doesnt have buttons? It‚Äôs a bit full for my tastes without the buttons.
4.0,"The replacement bands were great, just what I needed. But the shipping time was ridiculously long."
4.0,"I think these are super cute earrings, they are well made, great style and perfect size - but I do not like the loop clasp that they have. It takes me so long to clasp them in - that makes it so frustrating - to me, they were not easy on - I have nails and it was taking me 15min to put these on - so this is my personal experience of course, if you are ok with fumbling with them to wear them, by all means, go for it - they are worth the $$$ for sure!!"
4.0,I like the look of the band.  It is a bit difficult moving the slide up one handed but once on it does not slide down.
4.0,Very nice! She loves them! Great price too!
4.0,"This dress didn't fit me the way I liked.  But, I returned it and received a refund very quickly."
4.0,"Really pretty top, but runs too small.  I am a 14/16 and I ordered a xxl and It was still too tight."
4.0,I love this dress! Was very surprise it actually fit me perfectly. Love love it. Would totally recommend! üòÄ
4.0,"They're great sunglasses, smooth, think plastic, durable and they look nice however they scratch easily. Im very impressed of the quality for the price though,"
4.0,Love it but this is 2nd one I bought because zipper tore loose...maybe over use?
4.0,Buen producto y Calidad el √∫nico problema es que es un modelo de ni√±o que no sale indicado en las especificaciones
4.0,"Kinda big and long... but I am 5'2&#34;.  It was super wrinkled, but wash it and hung it dry.  It dried beautifully.  Had compliments on it the 1st time I wore it."
4.0,Very thin but pretty
4.0,They‚Äôre very soft and keep my feet warm but they start to get matted down after a couple of washes. Still worth the purchase!
4.0,I haven't worn it out yet - but it is super cute on.  I got the XXL for the off-the-shoulder look.  But I probably could've went with an XL.  I usually wear a 16 so go with your size.
4.0,Ordinary top. Lighter weight than i thought. Easy to wash.
4.0,The braes started catching on my clothes. Made some pants yard pants.
4.0,Excelente. Lo √∫nico es que la tela no ajusta mucho.
4.0,"I so wanted to love this Scarlet Darkness Women Steampunk Shirt with Belt. The overall design is very cool funky Steam Punk style, lightweight, comfortable and soft material. The downside, the sizing chart is way off. Top was tight, runs very small (doesn't match the sizing chart on the listing)."
4.0,very happy my ring is insured in case anything should happen<br />So this jewelry plan is a good thing to have<br />Just wonder why a second ring I bought and paid twice as much for I was not offered a similar plan
4.0,Works for me. Comfortable fit. LIke that it keeps mask of lips. Easier to talk.<br />Price for 10 pieces üñíüëç<br />For me my glasses still fog up. So I just get some anti fog.üòé
4.0,You feel like Spiderman donning this cap and pulling the smoked lens down over your eyes. The hat is actually pretty warm. The lens curiously are too low on the edge so you can't pull the cap down fully and still see out. The stitching was a bit loose at the seam also. But it's a fun winter hat for the cost.
4.0,I like the size of this small purse with many pockets and credit card protection.
4.0,Love the dark lenses!
4.0,Loved the way it shaped my body however it was super long. I could wear as dress or fold over a couple times right under my busy to bring above the knee.
4.0,Super cute! but not a high quality shoe ( as to be expected for this price) if the shoe is something that you might fall in love with (like I did) I suggest spending another $20 and getting a higher quality shoe
4.0,"I ordered the biggest size, 12Youth, but this size is still too small. My son is 11 and wears size 14 slim, I even tried it on my daughter who is 10 but wears 14 plus. They need to state the actual size instead of stating the age of who this is supposed to fit, which is what I assume they are doing. The fill of the sweater is fine and it's a great quality as far as the material but it's not long enough, nor big enough. The torso itself is not long enough, the sleeves fit pretty good as far ad length. Entire sweater fits like a size 10. (Maybe I missed the measurements, or they weren't stated, I dont know, I just saw the age and figured since my son is skinny and 11, he'd be able to fit a 12 youth.)"
4.0,I like this dress because it fit me perfectly.
4.0,Im 5'2 and weigh 125 it fits good all in the right places!
4.0,"Size was right, grandson said it was a bit big, but I think sweatshirts should be, so you can wear something else under them ."
4.0,Felt great on but would have liked thicker material or small amount of padding on the front.
4.0,Very very comfortable to wear in different styles. The drawstring feature is great for keeping it in place
4.0,Looks as pictured. I am large chested so it is a bit snug. The material is decent and price was fair.
4.0,Love the look of these slippers but they run very small.  Usually I wear an 8.  I ordered these in a nine and they are very narrow.  I hope they will stretch as other Ugg slippers have.
4.0,"I feel these fit true to size. I‚Äôm a very short girl, so they fit big as I expected. The straps are very confusing and don‚Äôt tighten enough like I‚Äôd like. Built for men, but aren‚Äôt too bad for women. They remind me of women Simms Waders, just don‚Äôt fit as well. If they had a women‚Äôs brand Waders, i feel they would be really good for the price."
4.0,"I would be more apt to call this a tunic instead of a dress. It's comfortable, loose and plain.<br /><br />The lace is about 1"" in length, not what looks like 3-4"" of lace in the picture which I was expecting and I feel would've looked better.<br /><br />I think with a little creativity regarding accessories this will be a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Not as nice as what the picture or product reviews had said, but it is pretty."
4.0,I ordered size medium and this set fits snug like swimwear does.  I'm a junior size medium so this is definitely a junior size even though it does not say anywhere that it is a junior size. It looks pretty cute though.
4.0,"Headband inside is a little stiff, but wearable."
4.0,"Prompt delivery, very well packaged.  Comfortable underwear."
4.0,"Got this for my son who wanted to dress up like the Undertale Character. He loves it and wears it all the time in the house. I won't let him go outside with it because I live in Louisiana and it's 100 degrees outside. I give this a 4 star because not even 24 he's of gaining the coat, the string came out the hood and I can't get it back in."
4.0,"What better way to bring out your inner child than to put on some Sasquatch looking feet and chase the kids around the house... VERY warm, maybe even too warm on some days as they do wrap all the way up the ankle and enclose the entire foot. I purchased the XL not realizing they offered the XXL which is what I should have gone with having a size 13 shoe. They still fit however, albeit tight. I will re-gift these to my Father-In-Law for Fathers Day and re-order the correct size for myself as I just have so much fun wearing them."
4.0,fits like the picture. i have a larger rear and am always worried about dresses looking more like tank tops or not being long enough. this has a light feel but fits great. isn't tight on the arms or neck area. feels like a t-shirt so super comfortable. i got the light blue and love it. may buy another color.
4.0,"The dress was cute and fit fine, but the belt was much too small. I think they include a one-size-fits-all belt with all their dress sizes. Bought a navy belt to go with the dress and now it looks great."
4.0,"wish these were more like socks, but still sexy on my GF"
4.0,"They keep my hair out of my eyes when I work out.  What more can I ask for? Nothing, really."
4.0,Grey small fits great. 5 1&#34; 135lbs .Its very cooling and classy looking. Cant wait to wear it on my vacay!
4.0,Received timely and the charm is as it appears in the picture. It‚Äôs not sterling silver but has held up nicely over the past several months.
4.0,I am just over 5 feet and 179 pounds and have short legs...they are way too long for me....they come up higher than my legs go... I ordered the queen size to accomodate for my heavier legs but it was too much!
4.0,"They‚Äôre small, but since i have a very small nose it works perfect for me."
4.0,"I like it, it‚Äôs very cute, but it‚Äôs a lot of dress, (heavy) so I sent it back. Great for a wedding party or mother of the bride."
4.0,"This is a very cute bikini, however, upon arrival I noticed that the shorts are more orange than yellow. The colors in the top don't match the bottoms at all, so I will likely sell this bikini or pair the top with different bottoms! For reference, I am 5'8"", approximately 155lb, and I ordered a size large!"
4.0,"Great buy, I was somewhat concerned at first (because of the price) but it fit very well and has help up well."
4.0,I loved the jacket but didn't like that it felt synthetic
4.0,Awesome product enjoying it a lot!! But little bit expensive
4.0,They are great... I just have one issue.. They should have better pictures of colors for the earrings... I didnt know the rainbow ones would be striped..
4.0,It was really cute especially for the price however maybe I purchased the wrong size or something cause I really didn‚Äôt like how it look on me.
4.0,I little bit small but I like it thanks
4.0,Cute shirt. I like it. Not complaining. Nothing to write home about. I wear it to work. It's long enough to tuck in my pants. It can be worn dressed up or casual.
4.0,"Very cute suit. I am 5' 11&#34; and wear a size 16. Nicely made, great price."
4.0,Es un ni√±o de 9 a√±os poco robusto y alto le compre talla grande se me hacia mucho pero estubo perfecta un nada de largo le quedo y de ancho perfecta comoda para un ni√±o y sus trabesuras
4.0,I like the flip flops. They are pretty and my wet feet don't slip around. I bought them to wear out to my pool and back into the house.
4.0,"The material is nice, soft, not too bulky. The waist though is quite snug for sweatpants. It is elasticated but not as roomy as regular sweat pants."
4.0,"At last, a cute UGG! Comfortable and the perfect height."
4.0,"I like it, a little see through depending on the type of bra you wear but other than it looks like the picture. :)"
4.0,Size fit as expected. I'm 5'3&#34; 185 lbs with large chest. Hides belly/butt. Flows nicely. Bought XL & it is just at knee. Very light & airy material. Comfortable.
4.0,I am updating this review. I have changed it from a 5 star to a 4 star. I do still love the glasses. Unfortunately they are not very tough. The arm has broke off on the last 3 pair quickly and I am very careful. They are just not strong enough for me.
4.0,"It's really beautiful, it looks  like real gold. I wear it 24/7. I noticed that one of the stones came off and of course I don't know when it happened. Other than that I really like it ."
4.0,"Love this dress! Super cute, but I would have to agree that you would need to wear a slip underneath due to thin material."
4.0,"The goggles fit perfect, I love the style I have them in red and yellow and will order the blue as well. I use them to swim inside, they're a little darker than I would like,however the fit is great. The suction around the eyes are great not uncomfortable. No water gets in. Recommend them to all."
4.0,I wear this watch 24/7. very comfortable and have had no issues with getting it wet in the shower or pool.<br />the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the face of the watch is on the smaller side and the illumination light is very weak. the print around the actual time piece is wasted space where they could of made the time window bigger in my opinion.
4.0,it was very good .
4.0,"Purchased these Silverstone earrings for an April Fools joke.  I never used them for myself but instead gave the to our granddaughter to wear when returning home after a few days with us, knowing full well that her parents did not want her to have pierced ears.  She took great thrill in wearing them home and into her house.  They looked like authentic pierced earrings.  Her only complaint is that the magnets are so strong that after wearing them for several hours her earlobes started to hurt.  We noticed that her earlobes were also turning red.  So for a child (granddaughter is 9 years old) it is probably best to limit the amount of time the earnings are worn.<br /><br />Also, they appear to be real diamonds studs.  The brilliance is authentic.  And, they are very attractive."
4.0,"The set is beautiful and came in a long box with each in their own individual bags, the earrings weren't heavy and shined and came with 5 clear backs, the bracelet is a bit hard to put on yourself as well as the necklace and the bracelet runs a bit big but then again I could just have small wrist. This set was perfect for my Sweet 16 / Prom so I tots recommend."
4.0,Very nice top.<br />However it's so small I don't think even an xxl would fit. I usually wear a medium to a large depending on how it's made. This top was so small I only got it past my head.<br />An extra large might fit someone who is a size small.
4.0,Nice belts but the buckels are crap. Luck was with me as I had saved 2 brass buckels from the Army. Saved me from pitching it.
4.0,Nice hat I would purchase again.
4.0,"I like it a lot, but the color on the band is starting to come off already.  I'll have to find leather paint of the same color to touch it up."
4.0,Looks great! I don't know how well the Gold Plating will hold up .... ask me again in a year! LOL
4.0,I like it that it‚Äôs very  easy to put on the fit bit and durability.
4.0,This was perfect.  Except main stone was loose.
4.0,The heart is very cute and shiny. The chain could be a little nicer.
4.0,"Adorable. I'm 5'4&#34; and 125, the small was a close fit but a little too big around the waist. Used a safety pin but that ripped the material a little."
4.0,"Holds everything in place better than duct tape when I run. Easier to remove than duct tape, too. Would recommend these over duct tape, for sure."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6c1aa5b15d1b7afc7da24170d98e71cd]] Love it, little snug, takes about a month or longer to get it. Simple and I like it."
4.0,"Fits well, nice quality. However, I think they look stupid on me personally...so I will most likely only be wearing them around the house."
4.0,Nice colors.  Tie was long enough to allow me to tie a full windsor.  Knot came out looking very nice.
4.0,It goes perfect with the purse i brought.
4.0,"great material, great print.  Washed the shirt multiple times, no cracking or fading."
4.0,"Okay so I love this system for all my bangles and it came in record time, what kept me from giving it 5 stars was that it's a bit of a cheaply made product. What can you expect for $15? The arms that extend from the base aren't cut properly so they had to be glued into the base at the appropriate height and angle. After a little super glue, though, it was just what I needed. Just don't be surprised if you have to give it a little love before it works properly."
4.0,"Easy, inexpensive, don‚Äôt shred my hands at the gym.  Colors are nice and can be stacked together comfortably."
4.0,"After washing....I got caprice pj pants. Other than that, the fabric is soft and warm, excellent for the winter. Wash always in cold water, my advice !"
4.0,Beautiful item ..minus 1star due to it being sent to me with 1 of the chains broken will have to attempt to fix it myself we shall see how satisfied I am when & if I get it accomplished
4.0,"Beautiful piece. A little difficult to put on your dominant wrist, but got the hang of it and now wear it every day. I get lots of complements on it. Would defenently buy it again."
4.0,Cute earrings for the price but expected less tiny looking gold tone
4.0,Not so durable though
4.0,This dress runs a little big. I'm returning it for a med.
4.0,"The top part has too much material on the sides by underarms (comes to a point, like wings or flaps) will have to get that part altered, otherwise fits fine."
4.0,These definitely serve their purpose! The backing falls off super easily but they hold up fine in my tragus and forward helix piercing
4.0,"I really like the look of the 'eyes' on this pair of studs.  The pupil and retina really do look life-like!<br /><br />The only thing I would like is if the overall diameter was a couple of millimeters smaller, because this does cover almost my whole earlobe.  Luckily it doesn't hang over or stick out, but you will definitely get some attention wearing these.<br /><br />The back has the same eye as the front and it screws on to ensure a snug fit, without squeezing the lobe.  There are also rubber o-rings around each eye to make it appear to fit in your ear a bit better.<br /><br />Happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I wanted something that wasn't matronly to wear at night to keep my hair from matting up by morning. So I chose this hat and I'm glad I did, it's really cute and it's very slouchy. I would complain that it does slip off at night, but it still looks really nice and I found I'd rather just wear it during the day anyway. The band is a bit tight, but I have a big, sensitive head and it's a bit difficult for me to wear any sort of elastic-type hats on my head for long periods of time. Guess I should have considered all that before buying, but it looked soooo cozy and it really is. So, while I'm back to scarves and bonnets at night, I've got a cute slouchy hat to wear during the day."
4.0,This dress was beautiful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the under skirt was very short in comparison to the rest of the skirt.
4.0,Bought this for summer vacation. Followed the chart and bought the appropriate size - it fit great. The print/color was pretty and the shorts were very comfortable. It gave good coverage (mostly across the mid section and back) but didn't look like your grandma's bathing suit. Well worth the price!
4.0,UPDATE: The company quickly responded to my review and offered a partial refund with the promise to improve production mistakes.  I otherwise love the dress and appreciate this level of customer service.<br />I am changing my review to 4 stars and will certainly order from them again!  ORIGINAL REVIEW (3 stars):  The belt loops were only partially sewn on.  It is a lovely pattern though.  I was pleased overall.
4.0,Comfortable feeling
4.0,"Honestly this shirt fits me but I think it would look better on a bigger chested woman (36C and up), it just doesnt flatter me"
4.0,"I brought the small size, but somewhat large.  But looks OK after I put it on. The result turns on fine. Will keep it."
4.0,"So these feel great, and fit well, the only complaint is that I'm tall and thinner (6'5"" and 175lbs) and these are about 5 inches too short if I have them pulled up to where they're comfortable. I can let the sag a little, and they're fine, but it doesn't bother me.<br />The pockets are nice!"
4.0,Linda pero algo grande el tama√±o
4.0,I love wearing these while playing golf. They're comfortable and cool.
4.0,My personal issue (why I did not give a 5-star rating) is I have a larger head and the frames are a bit narrow for me.<br />I'm going to see if they can be adjusted with one of my three pair. Otherwise I am very happy with the glasses.
4.0,Cute and decent quality for the price
4.0,my son was very pleased with this boot.  Fits great and liked the zipper for easy on
4.0,"Nice sturdy canvas bag, larger than expected."
4.0,Really cute!  I purchased the red one and it is smaller than expected but very roomy.  It looks like a small clutch purse and the material is sturdy.  I'm very excited to use this on my next trip.  It holds everything!  It will save a lot of room with my packing.
4.0,love colors
4.0,Ordered this as an OEM replacement. Worked perfectly.
4.0,I love the purse!
4.0,"The shoes run somewhat large, but can be corrected with a insert.  Next time I'll order a 7 rather than a 7 1/2.  The color is great.  Got lots of comments: &#34;cute shoes.&#34;"
4.0,Not very soft material. Is a bit big but I dont like my dresses tight. It is very cute and simple. Could wear with flats or sneakers with socks. Casual dress love love
4.0,"This is a great dress, however it came with a small tear near the hem. I would love to replace it, however I was only given the option for a refund."
4.0,"Warm as you can get...I wore these under Carhartt pants this winter....roughly 35 deg, and it helped alot!!"
4.0,A little wide for my face.  Cute design and bling.
4.0,Looks good but haven't carried it yet
4.0,"I ordered the black halter top suit. The top is excellent. I think it's super cute and the XXL was a good fit (I'm a 38 D). I found the wider straps super comfortable and flattering. I didn't love the bottoms as much, they did fit I just wish they'd have gone a little higher on me. I'm a size 12-14 and 5'8&#34;if that helps."
4.0,"Gets foggy super quick, the curve distorts your vision, auctions onto your face okayish, depends on your face shape I guess. Overall gets the job done, not that great as I expected, very fast shipping."
4.0,i am pleased
4.0,really cute but diamonds are so small you cant really tell them apart not as vibrant as the picture but good for the price
4.0,These are awesome. They are light weight and not too dark. They are a bit big fit my face but still look good. Wish there was a black color as well. Loved all the accessories.
4.0,"It took way to long to arrive, more then two weeks,  everything else was perfect."
4.0,"the watches are really beautiful as I EXPECTED but Idid not rate it 5 stars because one of the watches had a really noticeable crack on the bottom left side of the face. It was so painful for me to see since it was ordered for my mum as a gift . she even called me about it crying because of the cracked screen. i am hurt .Greatly, deeply. it feels as though i have lost someone who was really dear to me . i dont have a photo now cause i sent the watch to my mummy in hope the i wouldn't  have to go through this seeing that she is a senior citizen( 69 years) who wears glasses.i am an honest individual who truly hope you can replace the watch or the screen even to help make your customers saTISFACTION and overall perception of you  worthy. Thank you Kindly."
4.0,These are really nice earrings.
4.0,"I like the look and fit of these stocking/socks.  The amount of compression is just right for me and I can wear them for a 12hr shift without having them cut into the back of my knee or having my legs ache.  I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 122lbs.  My only criticism is that they are about 1 1/2&#34; too long for my legs.  I have to fold the top down a bit, but otherwise I am very satisfied."
4.0,"Very light comfortable material that stretches, perfect for summer months"
4.0,Love the shirt. Kinda small once you wash and dry so be careful. Overall though love the fit and style.
4.0,"I like this pant a lot. It is comfortable and fits well. I dislike how it came without a front button. I wear this pant to go outside to the store, to meet family and friends, etc."
4.0,"Easy to assemble, smooth up and down and sideways operation and nice quality fabric and frame. Will review more after using it for sometime, but looks great for now. Really hope it doesn‚Äôt fade even though description says fade proof. Was missing a part and customer service was very quick to respond and sent out part immediately. Took 1 star off because the umbrella seems really low when opened, would be too low for anyone over 6ft tall. wish it was a little taller."
4.0,"Thickness less than what is displayed in pic, but the ring is nice for what it cost"
4.0,Top was great! Bottoms are thin and see through.
4.0,"The material is a very soft, extremely comfortable jersey knit. The dress was true to size and the wine color was as depicted. The length was a little shorter than I would have preferred. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and the dress hit me about an inch or two above the ankle. There was also some weirdness on one of the seams, where some excess material was poking through, but other than that, I was very happy with this dress. Good value for the price."
4.0,Super cute! But be careful because the seams are delicate
4.0,For the price this is a great watch. The band is a little small.
4.0,It is a bit tight but I still love it!
4.0,So adorable on my little grandson.
4.0,I love how pretty they are. I think they need more dots on the sole for the non-skid to work.
4.0,"Good for the price, the material and stitching is lacking, but, its a Dress under 30 bucks so what do you expect? Great purchase but I don't expect it too last very long.<br /><br />I bought it for a couple particular nights out so, all is well."
4.0,I ordered size M and it fits me very well. Nice design and quality!
4.0,Fits my son.. a little long but I‚Äôd rather have that than too small in the width. he loves them. Ordered the largest size.
4.0,Small runs like extra small
4.0,This product is so cute I think that if you like it you should get it the shorter are a bit shorter than expected but otherwise great product
4.0,"The glasses are very lightweight and fit comfortably.  The lenses are very clear and have a slightly darkening blue light filter.  They do not have spring hinges, which is why I gave them a four-star rating; however, the spring metal temples do allow the frames to securely grip the head.  I'll buy again when these are lost, broken or the lenses annoyingly scratched."
4.0,Great deal. But slight awkward fit for my behind. Might be able to make them work but not sure. Recommend for flatter or smaller behinds
4.0,"I feel like maybe these should be included with the boots or not be so expensive, but they do help with fit, especially for someone like me who always has to do the laces on any pair of shoes up real tight."
4.0,"There is no stretch in the waist of this dress, which is the only place you really need it.  It fits a little snug but it's pretty and for the price I am going to keep it."
4.0,"So my almost 4 yr old wears a toddler size 9 in street shoes. Now we ordered these shoes because one the shoe store we originally went to didn't have the size we needed (dance shoes should be one size bigger then street shoes) and rather than order them from the store and wait a week or two for delivery Amazon had these and they were practically identical for about 15 bucks cheaper and they were only 2 day shipping with prime.  However with that being said these size toddler size 10s actually fit her a little bigger then the 11s that we tried on at the store now I know with every brand sizing can be different and honestly it just mean there's room to grow they still fit great once tightened up but if they were any bigger I would have actually had to size down to her street shoes size so I'd definitely say these run about a half size-ish bigger then expected least in our case anyway the shoe it's self is great, anywho our first dance class isn't untill next week but she has danced around the house in them and she loves them, so far they seem great."
4.0,"Pretty earrings. Colors are very light. Bought these for Mother's Day, needing to return them as they are much larger than expected"
4.0,"Wash carefully. 3XL is actually plus size (not Asian size), so that was great. But do not put in dryer, will shrink. Color matches the pictures."
4.0,"Other than the size being off, it looked great."
4.0,I love the design and texture of the fabric however came larger than hoped but trying to shrink with hot water wash. But over all excellent buy.
4.0,They're ok. I mean ... meh ... they're metal rings what can u really say?
4.0,"Using this for a clinical bag for Nursing school. It'd be great if it was just a tiny bit larger, but it does fit most everything I need. It's also great for hiking! Wish the sunglasses pocket were a bit larger"
4.0,"Now that is is cooler weather, the mask will be fine.  In very hot weather, it is uncomfortable because it is thick."
4.0,Looks great and seem like it will last long. I have a slight issue with the pocket; they are slightly small can barely fit my fist. The size also is slightly bigger than the jacket I used to buy but I think it‚Äôs meant to be big. If you can get pass that then it‚Äôs perfect
4.0,i like the design
4.0,"The calf is a little tight on me, however the socks are so soft, great pink colors as shown in the pictures. I have 3 pairs of heat holders because they are so warm."
4.0,"Exactly as expected, and my daughter loves them!"
4.0,Really like the dress but it runs big and if it‚Äôs too big the length looks unflattering
4.0,"These are great for keeping masks from falling to the floor or putting them down. My only issue is the clasp is very strong and if you need to change your mask for some reason, it would be difficult for a small child to do due to the strength of the clasp. These also fit for an adult"
4.0,I love them but found they are way to long!!! For a girl
4.0,"Got this to try and &#34;dress up&#34; my Fenix 3 a little bit since I want to wear it all the time. I was worried that it might not be durable or suitable for actual workouts. So far, however, it's worked nicely and looks great. Can't beat it for the price, as it's far cheaper than the stock stainless band from Garmin. Check it out if you're looking for a not-too-heavy alternative to the silcon or plastic bands."
4.0,Good qualify tnks
4.0,"The jacket itself is cute, and very light weight.  It will not keep a dog warm in cold weather but in cool weather, or to wear around the house, it will work great.  My problem is the sizing.  My boy is 9 lbs, and has an 11&#34; length, and a 15 1/2&#34; girth, so he's somewhere inbetween sizes.  In the past I had bought the double fleece coat in size 10 and it is a bit too long on him, the chest piece gaps at the waist and he manages to pee on it when he potties, so in this one I got a size 8 thinking a little bit smaller would help.  Sadly it's too tight and he hates wearing it.  I wish they came in size 9 as that would be perfect.<br /><br />If your dog's weight exceeds the recommended size for it's measurements I recommend going for the size indicated by the weight and be prepared to tailor the coat a bit."
4.0,"The band was jut a little tight, I think you should add additional links"
4.0,"Looks nice, just made a bit poorly, the central stone is not centered. Otherwise not bad at all. Took forever to deliver."
4.0,Cute shirt but kinda small....don't dry!!! Wash only and line dry...
4.0,Absolutley Love these. I have smaller glasses and these fit perfectly. My daughter who doesn't wear prescription glasses want a pair. I gave it 4 stars only because alot of people I know don't read reviews with 5 stars. But I would've given it 5 otherwise.
4.0,Hat is fine. The chin strap/cord is a bit rough. Will probably have a leather one made for it
4.0,"I have hardwood floors, and most slippers have hard soles, so they will make a lot of noise when I walk around.  There aren't too many soft soled slippers that aren't sock style.  These are a little bit flimsy, and I am guessing it will wear out quickly, but that is the price to pay for soft soles.  I like them though, just wish it was a little thicker, but they do the job!"
4.0,"The clutch is a bit smaller than I wanted it to be, but it is OK."
4.0,"I'm 5'9"" and 170 lbs - large was massive in chest and flowy from waist down. Exchanging for a medium. Nice quality of fabric and soft!"
4.0,"These shirts are great but I do wish the neck hole was smaller.<br /><br />I ordered a large and an extra large to try both (it wants reviews on both I'm doing one for both).  The extra large has a huge neck opening.  The large has a smaller hole but still looks awkwardly big without a similarly colored undershirt to mask it.<br /><br />Everything else about the shirt is great, the sleeve length is really nice and the material is great."
4.0,This outfit is so sweet and my daughter loves the skirt! She's ready for her first Halloween! Everything fits well with the exception of the leg warmers which were a tiny bit too large. Other than that it's very cute!!
4.0,"Nice bracelet but still too big for my tiny wrist..Good quality and description was perfect, but I still returned the item."
4.0,Good product. Bought as a gift for my daughter
4.0,Lanyard is a little low quality but for the price it‚Äôs great.
4.0,"Great to have 3 gold and 3 silver converters.  However, it can be a little difficult with some pins to clip into the converter.  Otherwise a great product."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Incredibly comfortable. Fabulous silky chiffon fabric. Classy back, although I needed a friend to lace me up. HOWEVER, the dress is at least 5 inches too long. Even in heels I can't wear it like this and I'm 5' 5"". Will be having it altered because I love it too much to return it."
4.0,"Just a little long for my height..I'm 5'3&#34; , went well with heels . Very comfortable...received lots of comments on this dress...."
4.0,There are no pockets in this skort!
4.0,Just needs adjustable strap on back.
4.0,"I like my other skirt by Dani‚Äôs Choice (Everyday A Line flare) so I tried this one too. Bought a size up hoping it won‚Äôt be too snug. Comparing to other skirts I‚Äôve tried, this quality is good, from seams to cut and all, but it looked too tight on me and the fabric seems too thin... tried it with a slip underneath it and it didn‚Äôt help... Returned it. I wish they used at least the same thickness fabric as of the Everyday A Line skirt - mine is black S and I like it very much!"
4.0,"This would be super cute if it fit right. I have the same dress in a different color from another brand and it fits totally different. Or should I say, it doesn't fit...I don't know which one is sized wrong. I like to think this one runs small and that I'm not too big ;)<br />It's an easy throw on/look great piece. Dress it up with heels, or dress down with booties."
4.0,So cozy and soft.  I would buy it again.
4.0,"Had them for a week, and so far so good. The clamps work much better than older ones with the rubber tabs."
4.0,"I enjoy these sorts of shirts but decided to branch out with the blue-striped pattern. It's not my normal style but I'm glad I gave it a shot.<br /><br />ZIMEGO/Dream Supply is fond of plastering their logo all over everything, which I found out on a different shirt where ""DREAM SUPPLY"" is written right in the middle of the chest. On this shirt, it's actually much lower near the waist. If you tuck this shirt in, nobody will see the logo. If you don't, be prepared to advertise Dream Supply to all your admirers.<br /><br />It's a comfortable fit and there's a faux-collar that dresses up an otherwise casual shirt. Recommended, but mind the tag!"
4.0,"Good fit, good quality. :)"
4.0,"Amazing look on the watch, really pops out in customizing the look."
4.0,So far I love it. Looks great
4.0,They also clear metal detectors if that matters to you. My only issue is that one of the metal rods came out so I had to improvise.
4.0,"This is such a pretty, feminine sweater. I absolutely love the periwinkle blue color. It's lightweight but still warm. And it's got a delicate pattern to the weave. The quality feels very nice and there's no scratchy or itchy bits. I also didn't notice any loose or pulled threads. Very nice."
4.0,LOVE! These are so beautiful. Fit perfectly.  Will be ordering from your company again.
4.0,I love the color and style.  As someone who is a bit under 5 ft 4 I knew there was a chance it would be a bit too long.
4.0,"I liked these because they are super cute and offer great protection, however, the guard on the bottom is definitely a little distracting/distorting. My coworker ordered the exact same ones and can't stand them. It took me a minute, but I got used to it and it doesn't bother me. They fit well, but if you have a large head they might be too tight."
4.0,Using these for a Halloween costume.  They are nice quality for the price.
4.0,I love the color of this top. It looks great with leggings and boots. It is really comfy too.  The sleeve cut outs are just a hair off than what the picture shows but nothing too noticeable. I'm happy with it
4.0,It's good because it has feature of adjusting size. But the leather is not real and strong leather quality. It is not going to have long life. Rice is higher than its quality
4.0,"It was great for a costume! My husband wears an XL hat size so it barely fit, but that's typical for him & hats. Good quality for the price."
4.0,"These gloves are so preety and soft. I have large woman's hands and these are a bit snug but being leather hopefully they will stretch. In comparison I got another pair from a vendor on Amazon and it was a perfect fit. Overall they are lovely color, soft<br />And the side ruching is very elegant."
4.0,"I bought almost every color of these. The only thing is, they will shrink after one wash. I started air dry them so they dont shrink. I gave away most of my caps to other people, as they dont fit the same anymore."
4.0,"I took away a star bc the bag I received was not the bag in the picture. It was supposed to have gunmetal hardware, and I ordered it specifically for that reason. The bag I received has silver hardware. It‚Äôs still a great bag, but not what I ordered. I‚Äôm keeping it bc I‚Äôm too lazy to return it."
4.0,The band works great and it's comfortable. Not 5 stars because the band attracts a lot of lint and other dust. I can be washed off but it is annoying.
4.0,Got a large since I had read the reviews ahead of time. So the jacket fit ok but the sleeves end right at my wrists so they are just long enough. Overall I like the jacket though.
4.0,This was exactly what we needed for rotator cuff surgery even the nurses commented on wanting all their clients to have this
4.0,Comfortable and worth every penny.
4.0,"It did not come with directions for washing.  Does anyone know?  Cold, warm and does the colors run?"
4.0,For the price they are great.  I wish they got a bit darker but so much better than readers under sunglasses  :)
4.0,"I wanted a fitted woman's Jersey and this one fits me great, except sleeves are about 2&#34; too long.  When will clothing manufacturers figure out that plus size people don't generally have longer arms?  Since do many women wear the men's boxy style, I figure I can get away with long sleeves. Overall I'm happy to have found one that fits well!"
4.0,gift looks okay
4.0,"They are little loose, comfortable"
4.0,nice looking and light
4.0,"I bought this track suit mainly for the jacket (I do love track suits in general so I didn't mind paying extra for a full suit). The pants are DEFINITELY tall girl friendly. I tried wearing them with some platform house slippers but the pants still touched the ground. I would definitely need PLATFORM shoes to wear these without dragging (but I think it would look really cute if you wanted the pants to show a small amount of your shoes). I ordered this in a size large. Depending on how I want things to fit I purchase items in a medium-xl. For reference I am a 38DD, have a fairly large behind (a set of thighs) and a regular tummy. This set fit fitted as intended. Only complaint is that the zipper feels cheap like it'll break easily if you pull too hard!"
4.0,"These are fantastic tank tops!! They are so comfy and let you breathe. Im a big chested girl and it only squeezes me in a little compared to what others do and actually cover my cleavege nicely. The one real problem i have is that the straps arnt tight enough even though i have tightened them all the way. The sewing is coming apart a bit, but nothing a sewing needle and thread wont fix. I would DEFFINETLY recomended these tank tops! I know i will be buying more soon!!"
4.0,It's cute and very silky. Had a lot of random strings on it tho..
4.0,"Granddaughter loves it, perfect for a pre teen."
4.0,This is a very cute top for work or going out. It is made out of thin see through material. As the title says order a size up to ensure the top fits good and makes you feel comfortable. Normally I wear Large or X-Large but due to the material I decided to try XXL and it fit perfectly. Overall happy with this top.
4.0,Kinda small for me but it's still a great conversation starter.
4.0,These are very small for a toddler to probably a 6-7 year old.  Otherwise they are cute and work great
4.0,"I purchased this item for my mother-in-law after a shoulder surgery made accessing her cell phone a bit challenging. She can wear it as a cross-body item, and the removable strap is amazing. The little clip-on on the bag itself is very handy for keeping it in a purse. Great idea for someone who may have mobility issues."
4.0,I ordered L because obviously this page tells me to increase one size. It's so comfortable and it's easy to carry things in my pockets without using a purse. Thanks for the invention.
4.0,"This is a dupe for the original dress.  The bow ties and straps are a bit itchy, but not a big deal.  The holes by the straps are too small.  Material feels thin and cheap, but this is a dupe!!  Might keep if I accessorize."
4.0,"I LOVED this dress.....until I washed and dried it. My mistake because now its several inches shorter. I really loved how it was floor length and baggy. I will still wear it because it's cute and casual, but I wish i never dried it."
4.0,Nice product! Use as a gift! They love it!
4.0,"The non polarized uv400 clip on sunglasses allows me to see in the sun, shade and inside.  They also protect the eyes against uv sun rays. They do not overly darken the sky or the outside but you have protection for your eyes.<br />With polarized sunglasses shady areas are very dark. Though polarized darkens the outside and protects the eyes you can't always see what is ahead of you as you walk."
4.0,"Lovely, and not damaged during shipping."
4.0,"So far so good! This was super cheap on lightning deal, and very cute in person! I sized up (normally wear a large, but bought XL) and I feel like this is is actually TTS and I think I would have preferred a Large. But the larger size is cute for a slouchy look"
4.0,Su color y su suave tejido
4.0,"These were a Christmas gift for my son and he loved them, but they shrank big time after the first wash and dry and then again after the second.  I purchased them a second time in January and tole him to NOT put them in the dryer,"
4.0,I buy it again
4.0,"These joggers are perfect for working out in, which is what I purchased them for (esp for the gym on those days I'm feeling a little fluffy). I wouldn't want to do any sort of distance run or extensive cardio in them, as I prefer a bit of compression to keep the blood flowing, but for a warmup, weights, and stretching they work perfectly.<br /><br />They're comfortable and fit well; for reference, I'm 5'7 and ~160lbs, and ordered a M. The waist fits just right without being tight, somewhere between a midrise & high waist, and I can use the tie to make sure they don't slide down in the middle of a workout.<br /><br />The only thing that prevents me from giving these 5 stars is the fabric... I'm not totally sure how to describe it. It's somewhere between a windbreaker and those pants you bought from Limited Too in 2004 that you could unzip to turn them from pants, to capris, to shorts (remember those?). I certainly don't HATE it, but it's a little too swishy-sounding. Once I've had them on for a few minutes I completely forget about it, so it's not the end of the world, and they're certainly more comfortable than working out in 100% cotton joggers!"
4.0,"I like the jeans.  Some reviews say that the jeans are tight.  However, I wish I had gotten a smaller size for a better fit.  I will definitely purchase another pair."
4.0,I purchased this for my husband and he likes it very much. It keeps all his  keys together.
4.0,Very very nice jacket but it's for sure made for summer only. There is no lining. I haven't washed it yet but it doesn't seem to have wrinkle issues. Overall a very nice pick.
4.0,"Love this dress! I have it in green and now grey. Four stars instead of five because even though I ordered the same size, the grey is a bit tighter and shorter and the fabric is a teeny bit less comfortable."
4.0,Perfect for my umbella
4.0,Great part of my collection
4.0,These were thin like stated. Nice quality. Color was exactly as shown. We were going to use them for costumes but shipping took to long. So just calculate overseas shipping time.
4.0,"Mixed emotions. While it's very pretty, the dress is very very heavy. Material for the pleats is very thick and was a bit overwhelming for me."
4.0,Small was still a little large.
4.0,Wish there were a variety of different colors but all in all I like it.
4.0,When i got them i wore them for about 2-3 days and they started to fall apart where you tighten the brace
4.0,I wish it had a bit more strap. Otherwise it's good.
4.0,Swimsuit fits great. My daughter calls it her Ariel costume for swimming. Fit was great. She wears it all the time.
4.0,"These look great, even though I purchased them without trying them on.  Good fit and great sunglasses for the money. Glad I took the risk."
4.0,Does its job and protects the watch
4.0,"I ordered these boots approximately 2 weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I usually wear a size 9.5 but I went with the size 9 anyways. They fit great and they're well worth the price."
4.0,I was surprised to see how many nurse charms were on the bracelet.  You can see that the quality is decent and some of the charms can fit other type bracelets of this style chain.  This was a gift so I am sure the person will be happy with this gift.
4.0,I liked the feel of the fabric and floral design.
4.0,Stylish very comfortable
4.0,"Love these! Not too thick, not too thin, not too tall, and not too short! They're juuust right, and cute. I love the smug look on the animals' faces."
4.0,"My bad... I failed to read that these were the ""girdle"" type.  Not what I needed so had to return.  They appeared well made and of good quality."
4.0,"Not as exciting as I expected and I haven't worn it much, but pretty for the price and good when you need something simple and neutral."
4.0,The packaging probably cost the company more than manufacturing the sunglasses themselves!! I do like the glasses though!! The price is right!!
4.0,These are so cute. You get the coverage but these are a far cry from ‚Äúgranny panties‚Äù. Only gave 4 stars because they run a bit small. Otherwise they are great!
4.0,Cute top for a night out! I purchased a small.
4.0,Fits perfect it is a very well made hat very happy with this purchase
4.0,I love these shorts.
4.0,"Love this jacket! I've been looking for a while for a jacket that is somewhat nice but still casual. I normally wear bomber jackets and leather/faux leather jackets so I was looking for something that was a bit more casual and comfy that I could wear around the office or in the rain without having to worry about being wet. Well, this thing fits the bill and it's really, really warm!<br /><br />The first day I wore it, people commented about it and how nice it looked. It's really good quality and is just different enough that people notice. I've had it a few months now and even wore it in the snow once and I wasn't cold."
4.0,Pretty looks longer on model...but still a great piece
4.0,"Made in China, but nice anyway. Wish it had the logo somewhere on it."
4.0,Very nice necklace. I purchased this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. And it is very beautiful she loves it. Hopefully it will last
4.0,Lovely holiday dress
4.0,"Got the XL size for my 5'2&quot; - 175 LB body. It's a very pretty, soft, well made dress. It fits fine but I have a bit (okay, a lot) of a belly &amp; a lot of junk in the trunk so I don't feel totally comfortable in this VERY form fitting dress. If I were to walk down the street alone in this dress I'm afraid I would get too much unwanted attention. LOL. I mean it is tight, it shows every curve. It took a long time to arrive so I'm keeping it &amp; working on losing a few lb's to be more comfortable in this sexy dress. Good value for the price.<br />I ordered two dresses but only received one. Hopefully the other one is on the way."
4.0,For the price...this dress is awesome and fits perfect and it's very comfortable with some stretch and it breathes. Only down fall was the back zipper when fully zipped flops over and doesnt sit flat...that could be fixed probably with a smaller size...I got a large. Either way easy fix. For the price again...beautiful dress.
4.0,"Muy buena, son c√≥modos"
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress, but you'll definitely need a body contouring slip for underneath. It's more sheer than the photo, not too much, but also thin enough to show every underwear line."
4.0,Maybe my skin is too sensitive but ouch when removing.  However they do hold these puppies up.  DDD's are heavy and it works.  For pain I removed one star.
4.0,Kind of hard to open and close but that is ok since it also means they won't come open when I am wearing them
4.0,Better than expected! I had to leave one star out because the bag came with couple of stains.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful dress, however the material is a little flimsy, and the dress is very, very long more like it‚Äôs made for a 7‚Äô feet person. I am going to have it cut down to my size. It‚Äôs a great buy for the price."
4.0,"Very pretty band, embroidered design, not painted. Fits Garmin Venu.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I bought this because the reviews said it was too big. That's what I needed, but they fixed the problem. Fits a medium wrist, up to 7.5"" circumference."
4.0,They were just a bit baggier than what I wanted but still very nice and worth the cash. The overall wash is nice and the feel is equally pleasant.
4.0,"Like another reviewer, I bought these for the case.  Its hard shell protection and the perfect size for keeping sunglass lenses to change out in expensive sports glasses while biking.  The case was exactly what I was looking for, arrived quickly."
4.0,"These are soft and cozy and fit true to size. The pockets are a nice size, too. That said, I don't want to have to use special care when laundering kids play clothes like these. I want joggers for my kids to be able to be washed and dried normally. I will inevitably forget at some point that I have to air dry these, so I'll just have to hope that doesn't ruin them."
4.0,"These are really cute shoes and the fit is just a little larger than expected - which is actually fine since it means I can put in insoles and make them comfier. However, the ankle strap is actually too big for my ankles. I had expected them to be snug based on other reviews. It's more sensible to make the straps adjustable, instead of assuming that a person with a larger shoe size has larger ankles."
4.0,Perfect for the water park and our local beach. My only complaint is that the shoe gives my daughter blisters on the side of her foot every time she wears them for more than an hour. Does run a little big but not enough to size down in for us.
4.0,This is a very pretty necklace. A couple of the pearls have some blemishes on them (spots and flat sides) but you don‚Äôt notice it unless you are really close. I think it still looks pretty even with the blemishes. I'm not an expert on pearls and don't know if they are actual cultured freshwater pearls or not. The chain is a nice length and can easily be adjusted to be slightly longer or shorter.<br />I wasn‚Äôt expecting super high quality at this price point. I think it is a pretty necklace and looks nice when wearing. I would recommend it if you are looking for a pretty costume style jewelry necklace and can live with a few imperfections.
4.0,Nice top but material is a little too tin and draws easily.
4.0,The earing is what I hope for .love it. Just one small thing it did not come with. The back. Oh well I had a pair any way it all good. Love them just the same. Thank you.MR
4.0,Good quality but I got an do with i wear .would be okay if I was wearing for a short not a jacket . Also must be youth sizing .Will be returning
4.0,It runs very small! But it‚Äôs so cute on!
4.0,"Claiming these gloves are somehow MAGIC is a stretch, but they are utilitarian, sturdy, and comfortable.<br /><br />But seriously - As another person in the house tends to get irritated hands in the winter from wet hands\detergents, I though I'd get her these. Here's our combined opinion on use (my mitts are larger and while I handled them, putting them on my paws is a surefire way to wreck them prematurely. Or stretch them out too much for my wife. ;-)<br /><br />These are a nice pair of gloves. They are made of durable material that is *MUCH* thicker than the standard yellow kitchen sink gloves. They are plenty long enough and are efficient at keeping your hands free of water and cleaning agents. The nubbies on the gloves help you grip dishes and utensils easily, and function as a no-scratch soft-scrubby pad. My wife reports her hands felt comfortable in them and that they gave her enough space to move around a bit if necessary.<br /><br />Given the utility, material, and pricing I can recommend these to people looking to protect their hands from the effect of detergents and water (this is particularly an issue in the winter), or if they just prefer gloved washing (myself, I generally prefer bare handed washing and my lizzard skin does not suffer from 'washing dehydration' nor irritation from pretty much any detergent I'm likely to use inside the house). These are meant for repeat use, NOT to keep a single application of paint thinner\stripper, lacquer, or the like off of your hands and then get tossed."
4.0,The description says personalize ur surprise but i could not find where to do that at. The quality is nice and its presentation is good. I am giving as a mothers day gift. Looking forward to a positive response.
4.0,Didn't  like the YELLOW lining!
4.0,"This is a great change from large fat wallets. I like Fidelo and would like to add two comments which could make your experience better. One item that Fidelo might consider is a YouTube video to show how to put it together and the choices you have to make it your best wallet replacement. Second, I have found the edges to be a bit sharp. It may be the material or the shape of the corners, either way I have nicked my fingers in retrieving it from my front trouser pocket."
4.0,"The color is much darker in person which is the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating. So If you are trying to color match the picture in the ad will not help. If you are just looking for a pretty, unique, purple necklace this is perfect!!! I love it!"
4.0,Fits as designed and comfortable
4.0,Might be an issue if you are flat chested or have a large chest
4.0,fixs little to big
4.0,Does the job. Not totally opaque. Good quality and fit.
4.0,"Well worth the price, and I don't wear pink often enough for them to be daily shoes, so they work for the days I DO wear them! :)  No blisters, cute shoes, happy with my purchase.  Love the little bit of flare on the heel pattern."
4.0,"Really cute. Just a little on the small side, unless it‚Äôs a jr medium, then fits great"
4.0,"Decent. I like that the width of the band can be completely opened in the front (not stitched on inner ""seam"") or folded in half for double thickness. Keeps those wispy strands of hair out of my face. Catches sweat well, no longer dripping down my face. Material is thin, could be a little thicker, but fits perfectly around my head, doesn't slip easily."
4.0,Tough material - i do not see them ripping or tearing easily.
4.0,"My daughter is very small framed and this dress is the perfect length, and fits her like a glove. She loves twirling with it on!"
4.0,the shirt is super cute it runs small tho and it‚Äôs a little see threw
4.0,"These are actually pretty awesome and well made. Only downfall is that they're matte and if you have oily skin, you will now have visibly oily sunglasses. Be prepared to wipe these off often."
4.0,"After steaming out the wrinkles, this dress is gorgeous for the price. However, it is too small in the waist for me. I normally wear a size 10-12 dress, ordered this in large, and it fits everywhere except the waist. I'm keeping it because if I lose 5 pounds I think it will be okay, and it's very pretty."
4.0,"The purse was a very high quality but, was too big for me ."
4.0,Really like the comfort and style of the band
4.0,"Great for everyday wear. Wore to Yoga and the top kept folding down, that's the only downside. Great material."
4.0,Wonderful great quality and fun costume!!<br />However; for SAFETY reasons may I suggest using a better quality heavy duty DOUBLE TAB ZIPPER to easily get in and out of costume with little or no assistance.
4.0,all toe ring that I have ordered off of Amazon are for large size toes
4.0,These earrings I unexpected to be larger but love them
4.0,Looks nice & cozy  you with skinny jeans and ankle boots. Material is good for its price
4.0,"I think this is an amazing watch it‚Äôs just incredibly hard to set up, I almost thought it was broken lol besides that I don‚Äôt like the band it‚Äôs pretty stiff even after a month of wearing it everyday, but I like that it‚Äôs quick release meaning you pull the pins with your fingers and just like that you can switch the band to whatever! Reading reviews before buying I take it off before washing my hands!!"
4.0,"Good spacer beads, they do lose the centers though. Will fit Brighton bracelets."
4.0,The ideal swimsuit top would have an adjustable strap along the base of the &#34;bra&#34; for added support.  I would like something to help support &#34;the girls&#34; a little better.
4.0,"Love it,product as described,good quality"
4.0,I like the bracelet very much! I didn't pay attention to the size when I bought it.<br />It didn't fit me so I gave it my mother who has very skinny wrist. It fir her perfectly!<br />She likes it.
4.0,Somewhat small get 1/2 or 1 size larger but they seem to have good support
4.0,Great im very happy
4.0,Cute ring... but very small.  More of a pre-teen/teen ring.
4.0,I am happy to find different sizes in same style.  I sometimes want small and large to match for the day.
4.0,"These little shoes are pretty cute! They don't seem particularly sturdy, but I suppose they don't really need to be since a tiny can only wear them for a short time before they're outgrown"
4.0,The material was a little thinner than expected but soft the fit was true to size. My daughter really likes them
4.0,She said that she liked it and she gave me a hug and told me people had given her compliments.
4.0,"Love how warm and toasty this thing is in -25 below weather. HATE the fact that it collects every hair, lint and everything that floats through the air or from your down coat. Looks horrible!! But who really cares if your really warm, right?? This is the first shirt from minus 33 that has done this. I also have the light weight and mid weight and no lint problems at all. It's like a piece of static ridden clothing out of the dryer, have found no solution as of yet. Amazingly warm though so worth it for me!"
4.0,"Great product, but the head is smaller than I personally need. The ring will go through my lip while eating, but thankfully my old lip ring head fits these bioplast rings perfectly."
4.0,I gave it a 4 star because after I opened the item and was letting my children pick the ones they wanted I noticed the white crystal was snapped in 2. All of the others were intact and beautiful.
4.0,"It‚Äôs thin, but easy to wear and take on and off without losing your mask. Looks like a stylish neck scarf when not wearing as a face covering."
4.0,"ORIG REVIEW - I guess I got a bad pair or the reviews averaged out in weird ways. These were way large. I ordered a size 8-9 as I wear an 8.5 shoe and these things flop. Also I have now had to sow the top flap back onto both pairs. The thread at the place where the gray meets the black broke the third day on the left, converting my slipper into a convertible, and then the same thing happened on the right side the next day. Fortunately my grandma felt men should be able to repair their things so I was able to restitch these but even for the price I should not have had to. I was wearing three dollar Walmart slippers before this that lasted four years. Years not days. Sadly disappointed. Not going to return them having already made repairs but not ordering them again. EDITED: This company read my review, gave me a refund and sent me better stitched replacements for free. The sizing is still off, but I am going from 1 star to 4 as company bent over backward to make things right for me."
4.0,This ring is beautiful and loved
4.0,Good product and reasonably priced
4.0,"I love them. I have a very large head that gets even larger as I chew. The flexible hinges really help them stay on my face and keep me looking cool. They would be perfect if my head was smaller, but it's not.  So yea...."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter‚Äôs first dance competition. They are great! Just the right size and had plenty of sparkle on and off the stage. Prize is affordable and they are sterling silver, a definite plus!"
4.0,Seems different than my other Dodgers ‚Äò47 cap.
4.0,Update: i added a star for good customer service<br /><br />Have only worn mine a few times and the coating is already wearing off.....disappointing
4.0,Super cute and flattering! Can be dressed up or dressed down. Would give it 5 stars but it is THIN so I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars. Probably won‚Äôt last more than a handful of washes before it loses its shape and starts to wear down.
4.0,Orange is one of my favorite colors and I love this on me!
4.0,My son loves these slippers! They do run a little small but he still wears them. Great gift for a boy or girl
4.0,"This top is so cute!  I love it, but I didn‚Äôt give it a 5 because the material is a little thin.  It‚Äôs fine on warmer days, but would be cold in the winter."
4.0,"The fabric is good, some parts are a bit bad sewed but overall is good for the price, it did come with every accessory so I can‚Äôt really complain. Order S size, I‚Äôm 1.62 m and weight 53kg, it fit me really good"
4.0,Good quality. Love the coloring. Fits great in the ‚Äúbuns‚Äù but really gaps in the waste. I‚Äôm gonna have it altered as it‚Äôs worth it to me.
4.0,Fits well. Fabric is not nearly as warm as i thought it would be great for warmer climates or indoors
4.0,You get what you pay for.. it could be bigger but I like it.  The only other problem is the loop in the back.  It is to big causing the sword to lay to the side when worn.
4.0,This necklace it more of a child! But it‚Äôs cute! I still wear it
4.0,"Product arrived on time and looks like I expected. I am very pleased, plan on purchasing other colors."
4.0,"too flashy for 'me' so I have yet to choose them, maybe the winter holidays"
4.0,"Very nice looking sweater.  Fits beautifully.  I'm a medium, 5'9"" and 160 lbs.  Only lots of threads haning out all over. I cut them off and seemed to be fine after that. Still, lovely.  Great color too!"
4.0,Gave these to my grandson and some his friends. Now they are all gourmet cooks in the wild. Thanks great little stoves
4.0,"I like the adjustable ear loops, the colors are unique, they are just a little ""unbreathable"" for my comfort level, but I tend to get warm fast."
4.0,"I often do yoga stretches in my living room while I watch TV.  These yoga socks really help my feet to grip the carpet and to keep myself stable while stretching.  As you might expect, the sock twists a little bit on your foot as you move from pose to pose, but all in all it works well.  They are a thicker material which works well with the stickiness of the rubber at the bottom of the sock.<br />I wear a size 5.5 to 6 tennis shoe, I feel as though they fit just fine."
4.0,"Gave It 4-Star's because I really like the sweater, but it runs small so order a size bigger. Also the pockets are worthless, way to small."
4.0,"My teenage daughter bought this one. According to her, she loves it as it is a comfortable sports wear. The fabric is soft and snug. No slipping or sliding. The only dislike is the size accuracy - the M/L/XL sizing makes difficult to fit accurately.  Overall, for the price, it is a good choice."
4.0,"So as you can see, I've pieced together different parts of different cosplays to get a closer depiction of Akali's All Out ensemble. I ADORE IT! I bought this cosplay for the jacket, and while everything fits perfectly, I am using a different pair of leather pants instead, because they're more accurate. Also using a different bag and earrings (the ones I have are not clip-ons).<br /><br />As I said, this is a beautiful cosplay, especially the jacket! It's actually wearable‚Äì another jacket I got was so stiff I couldn't believe it passed as an article of clothing LOL. I absolutely love the patch on the back, even though the tiger doesn't have the blue teeth as seen on some other jackets. Hands down this is the best jacket, because number one: it's wearable, and number two: it is the correct length, a true cropped jacket, and one I'm proud to say I'll wear out of cosplay too. Thank you so much!"
4.0,"These work pretty well, but don't stay on as long as we would like. My wife enjoys using them, but they fall off too easily and can be in the way. We just wish they were a bit grippier on the nips"
4.0,Good quality product. They do not feel cheap like some I have had before. Only reason for 4 starts is the stars on the flag do not look great.
4.0,"For the price, what's not to love? The dress is the same in person as pictured. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's pretty see-through. Must wear nude undies & bra."
4.0,Ordered a black and a navy size Large. Arrived wrinkled but hung them in a steaming bathroom and wrinkles fell out. Fabric is medium weight crepe (medium stretchy) which I like. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù @148lbs. Usually wear a 12/14 top for my broad shoulders and a 8/10 bottom. Blazer looks as if it was tailor made for me‚Ä¶no tugging/pulling. Will order pink when it is available. I wish they had matching skirts and pants. For now I will wear the blazers with jeans and t-shirts.
4.0,I got many compliments on them.  Worry that they are going to crack too soon as patent leather does.  That look and feel great though.  Excellent price
4.0,Nice! Especially with matching sports bras ;)
4.0,"Good Jacket for snowboarding. Only problem is the pockets. Only two large pockets on the outside, not enough storage on the inside. the phone protector is not big enough for a iphone 6 with case.  The pocket on the sleeve is nice touch, easy to fit id, credit card and cash.<br />The sleeve length is great. As a whole a very good jacket."
4.0,"They are good socks. Breathable and comfortable. But, they do not offer the same support/compression as my heavy duty workout socks. But that is ok because I started using these are my normal every day sock."
4.0,Well was alittle taight on my bass but looks very goog on me though üòç
4.0,"they actually fit good but because i have a somewhat longer torso the waist band could be a tad bit longer, other than that i love them, i wish they could make them with longer waist band for women like me..."
4.0,"Look nice. Frames are a little flimsy, but still nice"
4.0,It arrived quickly and was beautiful.
4.0,"I like everything about them except for some reason they irritate my lobes. They're very tender and somewhat itchy when wearing them, I guess my skin is more sensitive than others."
4.0,Very comfortable soft and stretchy for perfect
4.0,This dress looks fantastic. The fabric is a little cheap or else I would give it a ten
4.0,Very cute but a bit tight across the chest. Runs small.
4.0,"Great coat! Great weight for layering. Runs a little big, probably should have ordered smaller. I am in sales and can leave on all day making my calls as resembles a suit jacket.<br />Have bought this coat Twice/ 2 different colors for a total of 4 coats... lost weight and bought again as loved the first time"
4.0,It‚Äôs a decent hat. I ordered two hats and returned this one since this one was more expensive and I liked how the other one looked better.
4.0,"This shirt was purchased for a tie dye party I was going to.  Came out great, but the shirt is too small for me and it is on the short side.  I prefer a longer t shirt so if I am riding and my pants pull down a little I am still covered.  Too snug for me to wear and I ordered the size I normally wear in a ladies cut.  The shirt is adorable and I love it and if I lose a little weight I can wear it with a pair of jeans.  The tie dye on it came out wonderfully though and it is super cool."
4.0,"The glove itself it's short as pictured and ends mid-palm but not long in the fingers. If you have bigger hands/longer fingers, I'd maybe look elsewhere"
4.0,This is more of a shirt than a dress. I am 5‚Äô7 and normally a Large/Xl. It fits loose and it is very comfortable. The length hits me about mid hip so I wear it with leggings. The only down side is the buttons are not sewed on well and it wrinkles very quickly. I got so many complements and people telling me that it remind them of late 80s style.
4.0,"I would have given this dress five stars but the edges had some loose threading. However, after clipping the threads, the dress fit perfectly and looked beautiful."
4.0,"This is a lovely tunic, even if it doesn't quite work for my body at the moment. (I have hopes it will have a better overall fit once I get a few pounds back off.) The material is soft and comfortable. There is an elastic band across the back that I could have done without, though. It'd be more comfortable without that. It's also very lowcut. I wouldn't wear it without something underneath it or without sewing something to it to create a bit more coverage.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say the sizing is about right. The lower part showcases my mummy tummy a little too much for my tastes(but I like things to flow over my tummy and not have any of it show at all), but the top part fit me on the looser side. I am a pear shape, so if you're larger on top and smaller on bottom, it'll probably be just right. (The sizing wasn't shown, so I took a chance on it. They sent me a size large, which is what I go for most often these days.) It needs a few tweaks to work for my body, but it is a beautiful tunic. (It's super short for a dress.)"
4.0,Baby not born
4.0,Very comfortable and soft. Modestly priced and good quality.
4.0,Beautiful piece. I have 6 inch wrists and it was a great fit. I wear this to compliment my watch with gold hardware.
4.0,"i figure it will stretch. i like the material and looks good on my son. but if he loved it he'd wear it 24/7. he says it needs to be a little larger,"
4.0,"These socks feel okay. They feel a little sung for being a large pair but not to the point of discomfort. The stay up on the calves well, for now. They feel well made, strong seams, and are nice and thick. They breath well to help prevent foot sweat. Color and design are only secondary to function, but they have a really nice look to them too."
4.0,Super cute outfit! The pants were a little short for my 4.5 year old but they are stretchy.  The top was too loose and showed her chest but it may be something she can grow into or I could possibly pin it.
4.0,"Very nice earrings, as advertised"
4.0,"I love this necklace, I didn't think it was going to be really high quality, but it's not bad. I've gotten so many compliments on it already! Great price too, totally worth it."
4.0,very beautiful rosary and good service
4.0,Not as thick as I expected the frames to be.
4.0,Really cute shirt. True to size. Its not your typical cotton t shirt. It's mostly polyester. Not very breathable on a warm day.
4.0,I like all the parts that make up this costume- it seems more realistic. It was not super wrinkled from shipping and even the shoulder pads were in good shape. Fits well except the face hole is just a tiny bit tight- my kids have big heads though so that could be the issue. My son had two costumes to pick from and he likes the ninja the best.
4.0,"I bought two, the first one the color was WAY off. The second came in different, cheap, flimsy packaging and doesn't feel quite the same but it'll work for my one year olds photo shoot."
4.0,This is so cute and comfortable. The legs are a bit long but I'll have them altered.
4.0,I am a bit sceptical that the RFID blocking actually does any good. Likewise the construction doesn't look particularly sturdy nor shabby but I won't know how well it will hold up until I use it for a while.  I do like that it can be used either around the neck or body or as a portfolio for passport and travel documents.
4.0,The colors are brilliant. It‚Äôs a typical canvass web belt. The buckle has a strong grab to it. The buckle is a matte black and plain. I would give 5 stars had the buckle been more fashionable.
4.0,Love these...back is a little bendable.
4.0,"Nice, colorful, WARM socks ! Just the thing for keeping one's feet toasty in the winter."
4.0,They are really nice! Like how they feel on. They are super stylish and the color to die for üëå very happy with my cheap purchase
4.0,Simple and cute enameled turkey necklace for the holiday.
4.0,"I like it, very confortable"
4.0,"love the pin. cute, rubber back, even more bright than advertised but $11 is a bit much for this 2 inch big pin. i would have given it 5 stars if was like $6.50 but i understand :)"
4.0,Only four because it‚Äôs a little big and goes deeper than expected at the chest. My strapless bra shows.
4.0,I really like the sweater my family did also the only trouble his only trouble was it was too small
4.0,"Fit as expected. Color was navy blue, not blue as indicated. Otherwise, a satisfactory product. Comfortable and has pockets."
4.0,Nice band for the money but a little short will just make it around my wrist
4.0,happy but pricey
4.0,"For the price and being waterproof, my expectations weren't too high. But it's still a decent & lightweight rain jacket for spring/summer weather. The stitching at the seams doesn't seem like it'll hold up over time, but it should last a couple seasons without an issue.<br /><br />I tested it in during a rainy morning walk and it kept me dry. Not sure how it would hold up in a downpour over long periods, but light/medium rains are no problem with this jacket.<br /><br />Just note that this jacket runs BIG. For reference, I'm 5'8"" and 155 lbs with athletic build. I'm usually somewhere between a small/medium depending on brand. But with this, even the XS is big on me. The XS fitment is good in the shoulders and sleeve, but there's a lot of extra room in the mid-section. Definitely good for people with bigger stomachs. I have a similar jacket made by Columbia in size medium that's smaller than this jacket in size XS."
4.0,"Way, way longer than expected, even after reading reviews. It goes past the back of my knees. mid calf. I'm 5 foot five, 130 lbs."
4.0,I love this necklace but a couple days after I bought it the chain broke.
4.0,Very light grand daughter Leah says they are comfortable Grammy! So there u go!
4.0,Beautiful pattern and easy fabric.
4.0,"Quality jersey. No MWC patch on the front, I didn't want that."
4.0,Nice dress for the price. I‚Äôm a solid small and this ran tight. Very form fitting. I‚Äôd size up next time. Thick material. Long enough for me at 5‚Äô8.
4.0,"Okay so I love these laces but their packaging needs a little improvement so I really wanted to call it 4 and a half stars but it wouldn't let me do a half.  The package shows pictures as the instructions, which in truth are very simple, but the images are very dark and it's difficult to see what the pictures are trying to show.  Basically, you remove the regular laces from your shoes and re lace them with these in the exact same way.  The only difference is that instead of tying them, you run the ends through the cord locks and leave as much excess as you prefer and cut off of the ends.  You then secure the two ends in the cord clips that keeps the ends locked in and secured neatly without fraying. I was able to put these in my shoes in a matter of just a few minutes.  I absolutely love the color; it matches the accents on my shoes perfectly.  The stretch laces are so much more comfortable on my feet than my regular tie laces were.  I frequently left my tied so I could slip them back on the next time, but then they were loose on my feet.  These laces let me slip them off and on  but keep them evenly snug to my feet.  There are any spots that are too tight or too loose with these.  I received this pair of laces free in exchange for sharing my honest unbiased review and I'm going to purchase a few more pair for my other running shoes."
4.0,"Appears to be Good quality, looks as a pictured. My daughter hasn‚Äôt worn it so I can‚Äôt comment on how it holds up to wear and tear."
4.0,This does fit in my speedy 30 but it is not as firm as the other ones that I have ordered in the past
4.0,I worded medium size for my 10 years boy and I was too small for him so I gave the large one I bought for 12 years his brother.  That's all the problem. I need to buy XL  for the 12 year old boy.
4.0,"Got it for my momma on Mother's Day. Very cute, just took a while to get here. üåô‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèº"
4.0,Looove these...so comfy and fit is perfect.. never had PJs that fit so good..length is great too..<br />Would give 5 stars üåü if it wasn't for the delayed shipping... took forever to get them shipped from china.
4.0,Comfy for everyday wear but not for high-impact activities. Fun colors and the support inserts are less flimsy than a few others I have tried. It doesn't feel like you're getting into a straight jacket putting it on or taking it off. Really like the adjustable straps.
4.0,Coating chipped first day of use.
4.0,"Very nice looking crossbody wallet, good construction too.  Only gave 4 stars because it is a bit tight to squeeze in an iPhone 8 Plus - hoping it will stretch out a bit."
4.0,"As other reviewers noted, this fits somewhat small, but I think someone busty could snip the side elastics and it would still work fine. When I was taking it out of the packaging, a button fell off that I had to sew back on immediately to even wear it, and the other buttons are poorly sewn on as well and ready to fall off. The material is smooth and soft, probably a cotton-poly blend. The collar has enough neck room, but the top buttonhole doesn't seem like it's placed quite right, so the collar lays a little weird. Overall I'm glad I bought it, but if you're considering this, just know that it does look kind of cheap. However, it's given me inspiration to use this as a pattern to make a dickie from another old shirt that would fit better."
4.0,I really like the jumper part & actually paired with another shirt!  My baby got mad street cred with being new born extra. She rich
4.0,"Nice but baggy.  I am 5‚Äô1  114#. Ordered a small.  I love the feel and sleep in them, which is why I bought them"
4.0,"I got the ""dark blue"" which is navy blue with white trim. Label says 65% cotton/35% polyester; the look & feel are more on the polyester side.<br /><br />Very cute, form-fitting, comfortable, no particularly loose or tight areas on me (I am more of a ""column"" shape than a ""pear"" shape).<br /><br />Vent in back goes up high on me (it goes up 8"" on my XL dress) so I can't really wear this dress w/o a slip showing a bit in the vent area. (I mean I could, but I'd rather have the slip show than risk showing my backside through the vent if I squat or bend!) I have a black shapewear slip with no lace that works well; because the dress is navy, the black showing in the vent area isn't too obvious.<br /><br />Note: the vent is not cut in a way that would make it easy to just sew it shut; it's more of a long skinny triangle cut-out than a straight line cut."
4.0,"For the price it's a great value.  Good looking worker-style belt.  The buckle is clearly not as refined as you would expect in a $50+ plus belt, but that is not the price, so it's fine.  My waist is 33 and I bought size 36 per a recommendation, which has worked out well."
4.0,Very nice but didn't realize it was a whole case I was ordering. Hoping to order all my husbands watches with 22mm bands just in case any goes faulty
4.0,good fit and comfortable... however not totally no-show when wearing boat shoes
4.0,"I wore this for my baby shower. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 260 pds and 8 months pregnant. If you are top heavy like myself, you will need to wear a cami or bandeau underneath as it will not close all the way over your chest. I also had to pin the inside to ensure it would stay close and not have expose too much on the bottom. Overall, I order again. Also note, this dress is not black, it‚Äôs navy blue."
4.0,"did not get a chance to see it sent to grand daughter, but she says she likes it"
4.0,"This item was a Christmas present for our teenager who takes his steak Very Seriously.<br />Sturdy stitching on the straps and pocket and the printing looks clear and clean.<br />However, I would‚Äôve been a lot happier if this was a cotton canvas or a cotton poly blend instead of a non plastic tarp-like material. Also, it was creased very deeply from packaging."
4.0,"came in tact. very small, smaller than anticipated but cute earrings."
4.0,The jeans are pretty good but a cheap feeling quality the buttons feel cheap and so odes the fabric
4.0,"I like the shirt, it‚Äôs soft material and not super heavy so the material is breathable. Arms are a bit long i have to roll the up. OrderedXL"
4.0,Should have looked at the size better but it is pretty
4.0,"The only thing I dislike was the marijuana pin, I don‚Äôt care too much for it or it‚Äôs religious meaning and wished that I could switch out one of them but other than that, the product shipped well and arrived earlier"
4.0,"Inexpensive and the case us nice. They are rather cheap though (I know, they were like $11) and the lenses get dirty very quickly."
4.0,"This top runs extremely small, I recommend ordering at least 2 sizes up; I wear a women's Sm-Med and ordered the XL and it JUST fits me!  It is a very cute top but a bit sheer, you'll want to wear a tank under it.  Over all it is a good buy for the price =o)"
4.0,I love these! They are so comfy and the waist doesn‚Äôt fall down. The material is surprisingly stretchy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 145 lbs size 29 waist and a Medium fit perfectly.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c531f85ad8a76809a190ad1e89cd2bc8]] I absolutely ADORE this dress!  I will start with why I felt I had to knock off one star.  Going by the seller's measurements (in the photo stream), I ordered the 2XL.  Those measurements were the same as other dresses I have recently purchased from other sellers on Amazon.  However, while those fit, this one was a tad tight.  I think that all the other sellers included the natural &#34;ease&#34; in their measurements (not the measurements of the dress, but of the person that would be wearing it) so you really needed an extra inch or so for comfort.  It could also be that although the fabric contents in this are the same as others, it didn't stretch to fit like the others did.<br /><br />HOWEVER, that doesn't mean I don't LOVE this dress!  It ain't going back.  No way, no how.  I will either wear it as is, save it for if I ever lose a few pounds or order a 3XL when they are back in stock.  I do not want to take the chance of not having this dress.<br /><br />The neckline is a tad higher than I would like because I like to wear necklaces with my dresses, but that just means I get to wear one of the long ones that will sit on top of the dress instead of on my neck.  The skirt is full and you are able to wear a petticoat underneath.  I also love the attached tie for the back.  Granted, an argument against attached ties is that you can't take them off to wear a belt, but it also means that it doesn't bunch up and slide around the waist.  I did put a new red belt on it over the tie to see what it looked like and it was fabulous.  I guess you could always cut off the ties if you really, really wanted to (although I won't).  The fabric is also nice quality.  I will buy again from MaggieX (although I will go slightly larger next time).<br /><br />My video shows the dress with a petticoat underneath.  This is the link to the one that is shown [[ASIN:B011QIXU7O Womens 50s Layered Petticoat Underskirt for Vintage Dress (L,Red)]] , but I will be returning it and purchasing this one instead [[ASIN:B01FTPQOQE Tidetell Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt 26&#34; Length Petticoat Red L (FBA)]] .<br /><br />For reference, my measurements are 45&#34;/39&#34;/47&#34; and I purchased the 2XL.<br /><br />Update 2/28/17:  I just wore this dress to a tea function and got loads of compliments.  I'm posting pictures so you can see the whole ensemble.  Despite the bust area being a tad tight, I found it very comfortable."
4.0,Very cute a little tight on my 40d chest but wearable
4.0,"This was nicer than expected, it's a nice fabric and trim. Medium weight fabric, not a gauze type or super thin fabric"
4.0,nice glasses but need to be cleaned frequently
4.0,"classy. If you need a cane for a short time like I did , this is the one to have! Its probably not durable enough for long term use. Handle needed to be tightened often."
4.0,"Despite the current world-situation, I'm actually just using these around the house.<br /><br />For basic tasks, they work great and, at least, indoors, they do not fog up. I used them to cut up some onions, while my wife was preparing next to me. My eyes were clear, but she was tearing up. So, good enough for me.<br /><br />The view shield is clear enough for its price. I don't know if I'd want to use this for microscopic clean-room type work. But again, for around the house... No complaints.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Approved. Perfectly good for basic tasks."
4.0,Makes the watch look. new again. I did not realize how faded the original band had become over two years. A little tight taking the watch off and putting it on as I have a large wrist.
4.0,These fit anyone.  My girls love them.  Their soft enough but sturdy enough. This was our second purchase.
4.0,"I have had issues with my ball of foot pain from running and I  have been using these as very expensive slippers around the house. They certainly have helped eliminate the pain and give great support to my foot on the tile and hardwood floors.  My only complaint is that they run narrow.  I am a true size 12 and my toe box tends to hang over slightly on the sides.  If you don't mind straps, I also have a pair of Orthatheel Boyes Vionics that I wear outside everyday and those fit true to size.  If only I could find these insoles in dress shoes... and then I would be in heaven."
4.0,Loved them. Fit as expected for the price.
4.0,Great color. Good fit. Long. Needs to be hemmed. Comfortable.
4.0,The belt loops are too high on the torso for my likes but the fabric is great.
4.0,It is a good quality for the price but I normally fit a small/medium so I bought a large (per previous review suggestions) and it is still too small. I have to leave enough room with the laces so the privacy panel doesn't cover it all (there's a small 1/8 gap).<br /><br />Overall I like it and am very happy with t though!
4.0,I'm a bit thick in the middle (size 12) so it fit snug but worked great.  The Tutu is VERY fluffy and was perfect for my princess Halloween costume.
4.0,The bracelet dose change colors. Sadly my luck has not change.
4.0,"I have about a 28in waist. I ordered a medium and i could instantly put it on the smallest rings(i would order a size small). Breathes very well, does not roll up and does a very good job of holding form."
4.0,I like this suit. Especially for the price.
4.0,"Bought this for good luck, and so far it's working."
4.0,"Decent quality, they fit like you would hope. For the price you will not be disappointed."
4.0,Really small. Very very cute. Gave to my daughter.
4.0,Great buy! Just perfect! These make a huge difference for me to drive at night they don't reduce the glare of oncoming vehicle but they make the atmosphere bright
4.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; and pretty petite and ordered an x-small (My waist is 24.5&#34;).  The dress fit and it was very pretty, but the tulle is not as soft/flowy as I would have expected and the dress just looked stiff."
4.0,Beautiful fabric and well made but it does run small. Returned for that reason.
4.0,Plastic coating is a little loose.
4.0,Very pretty and the material feels great
4.0,I am 5'6 150lbs and I ordered a large.  It was tighter than I wanted and a bit see-through which was made worse by how tight it was.  It was absolutely beautiful dress though. I liked the material and the cut of the dress as well.
4.0,I like it.what you see what you get.perfect
4.0,Cute top. A little big but fits well and is comfortable.
4.0,Love‚ù§Ô∏è this dress like how it fits true to its size happy  with my purchase üôÇ
4.0,"They do not have a specification for compression.  They are sized strictly by shoe size, so my larger calves make it much harder to put on or off."
4.0,My daughter loves Sailor Moon and I knew she‚Äôd love these socks. Because of the reviews I checked our package for mold first and found some. Thankfully it came out in the wash and I was still able to give them to her.
4.0,"For the price, this is a great find and I've had several compliments on the pattern and color.  I followed the size chart but the recommended size based on measurements was way to large.  I suggest going down at least 1 size from what is recommended in the chart.  I probably could have even gone down to the Med but the L is quite comfy and that is what I was looking for.  There is plenty of material/room in the hip area for the dress to swing.  I am 5' 9"" and larger in the chest so finding items large enough but without the armholes hanging down too far is always a concern but no issue with this dress.  The v-neck is a bit low  so keep that in mind.  For work, i wear a slip with some nice lace over the bra area and it looks cute peeking out but adds modesty.  Length on me brings it a few inches above the knee.  I suspect I will buy another one in a different color."
4.0,Good kick around yoga type attire
4.0,"They do the job, but they have a serious case of the fuzzies"
4.0,"Love them, wear them all the time. Never irritate my sensitive ears. Wish I had gotten the gold, but I may just order them too since I love the silver so much. Highly recommend."
4.0,Love these pants. Used to be able to get them at Kohl's. They fit great and have a good amount of give.
4.0,"Nothing Like The Picture , Colors Aren't That Bright But Still Looks Cute"
4.0,"Product material as expected. Not see-through. A little wide, but overall good for the price!"
4.0,I like them but the are very snug for my junk..
4.0,"It is everything the description states. Classic, soft feel, even color and well proportioned for everyday use and can be casual or dressier. Delivery was on-time and well-protected in good-sized sturdy box."
4.0,"My son LOVES Daniel Tiger, and these jammies were a hit with him. However, my son is 3, and I wish I had ordered a size 4. They're just a little too snug on him. Otherwise they're cute. I just don't think he'll get much wear out of them because they're so snug."
4.0,It was a nice shirt but not what we were looking for.
4.0,"I wanted to love these pants. I like the quality and feel of the material, but the fit wasn't good at all. I ordered a 0 because that's what I usually wear. They were too long (this doesn't bother me, I'm short and everything is too long), but the real problem was higher up. The waist was comfortable and the butt fit well, but the pants were baggy in the thighs and the crotch was uncomfortably tight. I guess maybe the ""front rise"" was too short? It was not a flattering look. If you can find a size that fits you, these pants are a great value. I think I'm out of luck though, and I will be returning mine."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable shirt, but it runs small.  If you don‚Äôt want a more fitted look size up.  I ordered the XL which I usually wear in t-shirts, but wish I had gotten it bigger."
4.0,The product seems to be made well as far as materials are concerned but as I have used it for a while I find one design problem. The opening on the hook is rather small so it‚Äôs difficult to hook your belt loop. You pretty much have to pull your belt loop out with one hand in order for the hook to grab it. Would have been better if the opening was just a bit larger.
4.0,Very cute. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because in the one of the pockets there was a hole.
4.0,These fit great. I can wear them with jeans or dress pants with no comfort issues. I have been wearing RL Polo underwear for 20 years and I can buy them online because the size is very consistent.
4.0,"Basically comfortable, but snug on my toes. I am happy that these shoes will save my leather shoes from damage, wish I'd found these a year ago!"
4.0,gift for wife she likes it
4.0,"Its really nice and warm, but a tad small on the mouth piece."
4.0,"I am 5'0&#34;, weigh 107 lbs, and my chest & hips both measure 33.5 inches.  The top fits great!  I love it!  I have a small chest and it is very flattering and makes it appear that I have more than I do without feeling like I am falling out.  The bottoms fit but could be a bit tighter.  If they were underwear I would say they fit, but I like my swimming bottoms snug so they can't go anywhere.  I fear that with kids pulling on me or going off the diving board they may not stay in place.  I wish there was a smaller size.  Lastly, because these are reversible I instantly noticed that the lining shows slightly.  This may just me being picky because the lining is white which matches the suit so others may not even notice.  I feel there should have been stitching around the edge to prevent the lining from sliding around.  Overall, I really think it is cute and fashionable.  Hopefully I have no issues with the bottoms at the pool or beach."
4.0,Use mostly as undershirts for v-neck shirts and work perfect. Don't roll up under shirt and keep cool
4.0,Really like the color of these glasses.  I found them to be a little large on me.  I like to push them on top of my head when I'm not wearing them & they won't stay up.
4.0,These are great for my daughter for playing outside.
4.0,"Cute top, but I don‚Äôt love it...nor do I hate it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 179lbs, 38B & ordered this XL in beige, but it‚Äôs more of an off white/cream color. I was really hoping for that tan/oatmeal color shown in the stock photo. The shirt is all one length and boxy until you tie a knot in it yourself. For those who are self conscious like myself, once the knot is in place, the shirt will rise above tummy area when you raise your arms. The material is thicker & has plenty of give, but not at the stitching around the actual armholes, which barely went over my upper forearm area. You can also see through this color slightly. The neck area isn‚Äôt as open as I‚Äôd thought it would be, but it still allows for an off the shoulder look. It‚Äôs loose fitting, but still flattering."
4.0,This runs a little big which is fine because she is still growing. It‚Äôs adorable on our little one and the fabric isn‚Äôt scratchy or uncomfortable. I was disappointed with the bow as it‚Äôs actually just a strip of fabric you have to tie up yourself.
4.0,"Cute. Small. Exactly what I was looking for: something to carry around w me when I didn't need the burden of an entire purse!  The colors are darker than pictured, w the pink being more of a rose pink - mauve color.  The slot in the middle is small and tight, I can only fit a few bills in there.  It's great for a night out where all I need is an ID for the club, a credit card for the bar and a $20 for the cab ride home!"
4.0,"Glad they weren‚Äôt as large as one of the pictures seemed to depict them, because I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything too extra. The blue color really comes through, with the silver casing the back, it keeps the semi transparent gem more consistent as well.<br /><br />My only problem with that the silver earring backs I got are too loose, though they did provide a sort of silicone backs that works much better.<br /><br />The last item is a little microfiber cloth to help clean the earrings and keep them shiny.<br /><br />If you know someone who likes this kind of style, little hearts and a soft blue, this would be a great gift for them, or in my own case, a great gift for myself ;)"
4.0,very nice fit and style
4.0,zip on feet/boots came with a hole in them.
4.0,Good quality fabric and love the print.....<br />I removed the foam cups as they didn‚Äôt work for me.....<br />I bought a large and do recommend sizing up
4.0,Really cute and comfortable sandal with a perfect heel height.  The only thing I didn't like is it's a velcro closure on the strap instead of a buckle.  Have to wait and see how long the velcro lasts before it loses it's hold.
4.0,"I found that the dress fit, but was a little to small"
4.0,"Not that small, just preferred larger so not so Clingy"
4.0,Soft material but the sizes do run quite large
4.0,Ring looks and feels awesome would be 5 stars but does run a little small hoping it stretches out some.
4.0,"Though I like and wear generally mid-rise and this is low rise, the fitting of the leggings is really nice. Somehow the look and feel is very good and also I love the material. Many times you see the description say cotton and then it is hardly cotton may be 30%, but it is not. I gave 4 star only because it is not that firm near waist-area and cripples down."
4.0,This is a wonderful bathing suit for this price!  I wanted to leave a review with my size and how the suit fit to help other shoppers.<br />I bought the size XL (16-18)<br /><br />My measurements are 45-36-44 with a 36 DDD bra size.<br /><br />The bottoms are a bit loose but I was planning on wearing different bottoms (skirtkini) anyway and they are wearable I think.<br />The top would be a bit tight if it wasn't for the freedom in sizing given by the laces.
4.0,"It's okay, has a lot of threads lose and hanging. I means it's ok for price. Cheap kind."
4.0,A LITTLE LARGE FOR A SIZE 10 BUT i DONT HAVE TIME TO RETURN ...ALASKAN CRUISE 3 DAYS...NUFF SAID
4.0,"I really enjoy this ring. I have a large ring size and was very happy to find this. It looks just like the image and I've received several compliments on it. My only gripe is that it says it's sterling silver. It may be silver plated, but the copper color of the real metal it's made out of is starting to show through."
4.0,Overall great product though.
4.0,Super cute after you take the pads out of the shoulders.
4.0,"This was a nice dress, I liked the color and the material. It fit a little snug."
4.0,"The material was nice and soft, the print was very pretty.  I liked the overall length, however, the waist hit me at the absolute worst place possible- maybe I should have tried a larger size,  not sure. I returned it without issue."
4.0,This is such a great find!  What an adorable top for such an inexpensive price.  Very trendy and covered everything that needed to be.  Perfect with skinny jeans and boots.
4.0,Received this in lots of bubbly packaging. Has been working for a week or so and hasn't died. Lastly- the colors are great but I was wearing a new pair of jeans and it got marked blue- my fault but yea. Will update to a five if the battery lasts. :D
4.0,Loved it. Can't wait to wear it.
4.0,"For what it is at the fairly cheap price point, it's hard to complain. It's somewhat hard to put on, and a huge pain to take off but thus is the case I imagine with all chain mail. It's very baggy which is understandable. The only real downside is that the rings sometimes pop off and I either just deal with a missing ring or I try to put it back. Sometimes I'll go over it looking for rings beginning to open. Once you have a tunic/cloak or something on top of it, all the downsides pretty much go out the window."
4.0,"I saw a few reviews saying to go a size up I was planning on getting a larger sweatshirt anyways because I usually like how they fit. I got an XL I used the size guide for the chest and compared it to a sweatshirt I already have. It just has a strange fitting. I feel like it was much longer and narrower than other XL sweatshirts. Since it‚Äôs made of polyester I was expecting it to be cheap so it was no surprise to me when the fabric had a shiny look to it. It‚Äôs pretty thin, if you hold it up to light you can see through the fabric a little bit. The label definitely feels delicate so I suggest that you turn it inside out when washing and definitely do not to put it through the dryer. It also says not to put in the dryer on the tag. Even with its flaws I still very much love this sweatshirt. I hope I‚Äôll be able to find a cotton version in the future but this will do for the time being. I‚Äôm gonna go rewatch haikyuu for the third time now üòÅüñ§üß°üèê"
4.0,"The wallet is pretty cool, but the pocket on the button-side is undoubtedly worthless and the wallet itself doesn't hold very much for those who may have a decent amount of library cards, credit cards, and a variety of other cards. As a basic wallet to carry some cash and a few cards it's not too bad, although I am not a fan of the &#34;matching&#34; gold chain so I replaced it with some other chains that I currently use and it seems to work just fine. Don't expect too much from the wallet, but it's a nice little addition to have around."
4.0,Really good quality leather! A slight bit big but still great quality and very comfortable!
4.0,"The material is beautiful, the print is so cute. But these are some bootie shorts! I got my boy a 6-7T. They fit him but are way way too short, he has boxer underwear that are longer. Will be returning, they defiantly are not as long as advertised. I won't get a bigger size because I just don't see the leg length being much longer."
4.0,"large for me but very nice , soft to touch and I really like the color."
4.0,Nice to have to this petite neckace in something different.  I hardly wear representative jewelry (butterflies; hearts; butterflies) but I had to have this.  Smaller than expected but nice.  Fine chain was knotted by the time it arrived; fortunately I was able to get it apart.
4.0,Not bad quality..
4.0,Fits well and does the job. The Velcro is a bit rough and has occasionally rubbed my skin.
4.0,"This is a great pant suit! U can dress it down or up an pretty much wear it to any occasion. Now I really thought it was more of that loose fitting fabric it's more of a spandex. Did not look the greatest on me, but believe it or not my mother looked absolutely adorable in it! She even throws a white blazer on with some heels and wears it to church."
4.0,Fits comfortably and is secure. No worries of it coming off. It has enough holes for any adjustment. Matches the rose pink watch and fits it perfectly.
4.0,Perfect fit for my new go-tcha. And the chain is great it‚Äôs not some fake plastic chain the only thing I wish is for it to be a little longer maybe by 2inches.
4.0,"Hard to tell which way is front, and fabric is odd. Won't shrink so don't bother trying. Still great."
4.0,Material couldve been a little more thicker but perfect for display/light weight wear
4.0,Really pretty and colorful
4.0,I love the material of this dress but it is somewhat large. I purchased the XLarge Plus and it was was a bit baggy. I still love it but wish I would have gotten a size smaller.
4.0,"nice. soft material but runs a bit small. If these are for sleeping, would recommend going up a size"
4.0,These are really pretty for the price.  A great value.  Many of my clients want these types of barefoot sandals for their beach weddings and they can be pricey.  I orderred these as a sample for a client and am really very happy with them!
4.0,"I bought the up to size 9, but suggest you but next size up.  My foot is an 8 - 8 1/2.  It has a gripper on the inside of the back heel and does stay in place.  I don't put them in a dryer because I didn't know if they would shrink.  Otherwise, they work ok"
4.0,"The dress is very gorgeous and fits the curves nicely. I love the color of this dress but it is see-through. You can see my entire behind from the back. That's my only downfall to this dress. Other than that, it's perfect. ü§ç"
4.0,"looked very nice, but had to wear a jacket over it because it was clingy in places that were not very flattering."
4.0,Love the width and color (purple). Easy wear. Unsure how long it will last.
4.0,"I loved the look and feel of the purse.  It was awesome, except for the size. Yet I did return it, since I am a short woman under 5ft tall.  The bag had more height to it than I Thought it did.  So was large for me.  Other than that I would have gladly kept the item."
4.0,Live the size and can't wait to use it.
4.0,"Runs a little tight, but i like the length. I probably would size up one if i ordered again."
4.0,"I was expecting this to be like a sweater, but it‚Äôs more like a crew neck sweatshirt. Still very cute and comfy. I‚Äôm a 16-18 and the xxl fits great, not too small and not the oversized look"
4.0,"The chain is a little too long and the pendant itself can with scratches on the backside. However, the pendant is gorgeous and looks great."
4.0,"These leggings are cute but toget the look I want I have to pull them up like 5 inches above my belly button!! Which would be ok with me if they would stay up! I have to constantly keep pulling them up, which is annoying! They sag to much in the front if. you don't pull them up! I think would fit people between size 15 & 18 best! Overall I like the leggings."
4.0,"Really nice size stone, the chain that comes with it is very dainty.  I love the color of the stone."
4.0,"Bought this too mostly lounge around the house in, as im a plus size SAHM and wanted to switch up from the usual bulky hoodie/sweatpant attire, this was perfect. Not to thick, not to thin, i paired it with a light tank, and leggins and in was super comfortable. I went a size(3x) bigger then should've, but thats fine, im sure it will shrink after a couple washes. Even if it doesn't it's not that bad. Would definitely buy again."
4.0,They do what they are suppose to do
4.0,"Pros: small, convenient, pretty good quality for its price<br />Cons: there are times when the zipper gets a little stuck, also the card holders arent leveled like i thought it would be. So its hard to get out the card since the top of the zipper line was in the way when i pull out the card. Pretty small pouch for coins in the middle. its more convenient to get the coins by dumping my coins out to pick it out.<br />Pics: i have pretty big hands and its so convenient to hold."
4.0,"It had a really weird smell when I first opened it, but this sweater is really cute and I can't wait for cooler weather again so I can wear it."
4.0,"The ear cuff is very pretty and sparkly. Perfect for my Christmas outfit, I'm wearing (guess not) to my Christmas party. But it's cancelled."
4.0,"Nice shirt after first wash, good price will be ordering more"
4.0,"To start, I have seen some reviews critical of the sizing chart.  Luckily for me, they are a very good fit.  I typically wear a 10.5 and can stretch into an 11.  I also have an extremely wide/flat foot.  The 45 work perfectly for me, but I think they might run just the slightest bit big.  I just got these shoes yesterday (it took 3 days with Prime unfortunately), and they have been pretty good for my two rides so far.  While I haven't had a chance to go on a 20-30+ mile ride yet, they have been comfortable for my shorter rides and I dont see them becoming uncomfortable at longer distances to this point.<br /><br />I am using them with my Shimano PD-M530 pedals on my road bike.  I was looking for a recessed cleat and the ability to clip in on either side of the pedal with this configuration as I am not extremely concerned with weight at this point in my cycling. The only qualm I have with them so far is that while walking on any surface that is not completely flat, the cleat noticeably rubs against the uneven surface.  I was hoping they would be just a tad bit more recessed than they are so I don't have to ever be concerned about that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good shoe so far.  I will try to update this post if anything changes after longer rides and more usage.  Also, no cleats are provided with these shoes, but in my experience that is completely expected.  I have always known the cleats to come with the pedals.  Unfortunately if you are using these with existing pedals, you will have to either change out an old set of cleats or buy new ones."
4.0,"I gave this to a friend as a gift and she loved it!  I knew she would love it, especially the unique style.."
4.0,I get so many compliments..i love how light and thin this fabric is. Sleeves were kinda just about right...maybe for someone else they might be tight. Over all worth what i paid for.
4.0,They are ok some are way big and other way to small
4.0,Took my first cold weather ride in these boots last month in Minnesota.  The temp was 18 F and yet my feet remained toasty warm.  Not the most stylish cycling boot but at that temperature who the heck cares.  Agree that they tend to run on the small size especially when combined with a warmer sock.  If you are in between sizes err on the side of bigger.
4.0,These shorts are great for gym workouts and for one hour or less runs. They fit great and true to size. The liner shorts on the inside help prevent chafing. Just wish the were a lighter weight for longer runs. They are a solid medium weight short that works best at the gym.
4.0,"Nice shirt, thought it would be longer !!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,As advertised. Good value.
4.0,Overall a nice top.  The material is a little clingy/stretchier than I would've liked.
4.0,"I got this as a gift for myself and my fianc√©e. It looked great on her and I'm glad I ordere a size up to be on the safe side. She generally wears a medium, but this in large fit her perfectly.<br /><br />The lace on this set is soft and not scratchy at all, and just see-through enough to be sexy without being tacky. The T-back panty completes the top perfectly.<br /><br />The only downsides are that the top doesn't offer too much in the way of support, although the straps are adjustable which is nice. The front of the top closes simply by tying the ribbon into a bow, which makes it really easy to open up the front, could be a plus or minus depending on how you look at it.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Nice color asst of three tie. My one comment would be, I wish they were more solid rather than a print weave design. But the blues and orange make for a nice assessory to fancy up ones style."
4.0,I like this for the winter because I wanted something warm yet dressy. This is great and takes the guessing game out of what to wear since it‚Äôs an all in one outfit lol I‚Äôm about 180 and I got a 2XL that seemed to fit me like a glove. The material is great and thick. Good quality. The sleeves were a good size and the slight turtle neck didn‚Äôt choke me. The legs were long but of course this is dressy and I wore it with heels so this wasn‚Äôt an issue. I just loved how the pants flare when I walk. If your going to get this I suggest getting a dark color such as this green because it did give me a bit of a camel toe (it may be my body shape so this might not be true for everyone) but otherwise I love it. Definitely wearing it again and again
4.0,I loved DBZ as a kid and could not resist purchasing this shirt because who doesn't want to work out like a Saiyan?? It fits a more snug than I was expecting but it looks good on me. I have no complaints. Maybe buy a size up if you like some baggage in your clothing.
4.0,"This dress was a backup to another dress and ended up being THE dress for a June wedding! Color is very vibrant and fit is pretty good. I am 5'9 170 for reference and the dress was not short on me. It hit at my knees which was perfect for the tulip design at the bottom of it. I am a B cup so the top was a bit big but I just safety pinned it. I will take to a seamstress for actual fitting but in the moment the safety pin worked.<br /><br />CONS: Fabric is thick BUT not concealing. This means that support garments are a NO GO. I couldn't even wear a thong, so I had to go commando! If you have no problem with this, great dress! I would imagine a darker color would conceal better though.<br />It also rose when I walked. I think this is attributed to it being a single layer dress. It wasn't overly nagging though.<br /><br />Other than the above, it was a hit, received a lot of compliments!!"
4.0,Kinda chintzy but still cute!  The price was great too!
4.0,"I like a longer scarf because I am tall.  This one fits the bill.  But what I don't like about it is the feel of the material and the added spandex.  It keeps you warm, but is not fuzzy and pleasurable like some scarves.  This one is stretchy due to the spandex.<br />Looks fine, though."
4.0,"The weather here change a lot here where I live and this jacket is just right for light temperature and is really comfortable, no regrets"
4.0,nice alternative for slippers without being to hot on my feet.
4.0,Nice shirts but do run a little on the small side.  I ordered the small and found the arms a little too short and the length of the shirt a little short.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 125 lbs
4.0,"Great fit, but much longer than expected..that's why 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,"I ordered this hat for my boyfriend thinking that it was made for men, not boys. But it will work. It was a good shipping time though!"
4.0,These fit great and are great quality but the shiny screen print three stripes on the leg get so hot in the sun they were leaving red marks on my husbands leg. Just something to consider
4.0,Great pants for travel and hiking.
4.0,The look great. Sparkle residue was on the lenses and took a bit to get rid of. The case came unglued instantly. ultimately I like the look and color is awesome.
4.0,"Soft foot bed, and rubber bottom for newer walkers, the leather toe piece is super soft and pliable. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because it runs a little small. Other shoes I purchased at size 4 were too big, and this was slightly too small."
4.0,"This looks very nice and feels very comfortable, but for the bunching of fabric at the hem. It's not a real problem, but sometimes getting it straight while tossing and turning is a challenge."
4.0,"I ordered this Tournesol Women's Bikini Set High Waisted 2 Piece Swimsuit Ruffle Ruched Bathing Suit in a flurry of Tournesol shopping. When I discovered this bathing suit brand I was over the moon at how their fit and style combined works so well for me. This suit is so pretty. I love the bold green top and the fun palm leaves on the bottom.<br /><br />Very flattering about this suit is how high-waisted it is. I was a little disappointed in the top though; there are more straps to hold it closed in the back than I realized, and I don't think the straps look good with this particular top. The front of the top also isn't particularly flattering for my d√©colletage, unlike Tournesol's other suits that I've tried. I took off a star for this, but for everything else I like about it I give it four stars."
4.0,Great prouduct
4.0,"Very good, only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that they didn‚Äôt come with earring backs."
4.0,It‚Äôs cool fits pretty good . I am just used to flex fit so it‚Äôs a little tighter
4.0,"Bought these for my husband, he has neck issues resultant of surgery a couple of years ago. He gets chilled easily. I would have given them 5 stars if the weight were a little heavier to fit his warmth needs."
4.0,It's nice but way too small. I'm like a size 6 dress and ordered a medium but it was WAY too small. Had to ask for help to zip it up. I wouldn't even dare trying to sit down in it.
4.0,"My kids LOVE Yellow Box flip flops. The fabric between the toes in this model makes the shoes extra comfortable, and the iridescent material is super cute. My daughter wears these all day. My only complaint is they run a little small (length wise). I ordered them in her regular size and they fit, but just barely. Her heel was close to the on the edge. I could easily have ordered a size up and they would have fit,  with room to grow."
4.0,"I was thrilled the first time I wore a pair of these. They stayed up all day. Then I used them a second time, and they would not stay up. I was pulling them back up all day. With 4 pairs, I guess the price isn't bad for single-use, but if you need them to last, I'd go somewhere else.<br /><br />UPDATE: The seller offered me several options in order to make things right. I do appreciate great customer service!"
4.0,"I ordered the purple and red in a small. The dress is comfortable and fits me exactly (my measurements are approx 35-28-32. 122 lbs, 5 ft 2.5.) My only complaint is that it appeared longer online and when I tried it on, the hem only just barely covered my knees. Usually that doesn't happen at 5' 2&#34;! I prefer at least an inch below the knees on all my skirts and dresses, being a religious Jew. I had to seamrip the bottom and am deciding if I like the frayed look or will have it rehemmed to be almost an inch longer. Will also try ironing. However, I felt so comfortable and nice in it, love the colors, zipper works well, nice durable material, great for any season except summer, great style, no layers needed underneath, very cute and modest aside from length. 4 stars<br />Update: Later in the year I added 3 inches of black material which turned out really cute. This dress is warm, comfortable and great for fall, winter and even early spring. The only thing that still doesn't work is the shoulders are too wide, but I do have narrow shoulders. The fact that it's really durable and classic means it will be a favorite for years to come!"
4.0,"Buen producto, relaci√≥n con el precio"
4.0,Cute color made well
4.0,They so cute
4.0,"Great dress, nice material and well constructed, but the dress was much larger than anticipated. I very much wish this came in an extra-small."
4.0,"These are harder to find than you think. I bought these for my husband who has poor circulation due to type 1 diabetes.  He like to wear them in the winter when using his computer. The fabric is a little cheap. Hopefully, they'll hold up."
4.0,These jeans are not as tight as I expected I normally wear a 0 if the jeans are stretchy because I like a tighter fit jean. I ordered a small and It was a little loose but the jeans have a great material they are very streatchy I would definitely recommend this item I just with they sold an xs.
4.0,"These are fine earrings if you like leather, and large jewelry.  I wear them occasionally and they usually get compliments."
4.0,"A little itchy as the fabric is harsh, but it looks good."
4.0,"Super cute, dressy, yet casual"
4.0,I love this suit. The fit was as expected. Very flattering. I liked it so much I ordered another one in a different color. BUT....<br /><br />The 1st suit I ordered was $19.99. Within weeks the price went UP  to $28.99.
4.0,Winter wardrobe
4.0,"If you're a large better order a medium, otherwise there is no compression."
4.0,Very pretty but a bit cheaper than I expected.
4.0,"Serves its purpose, and I like the black. The carabiner part is a little smaller than I expected. Came on time."
4.0,Great quality. I ordered based on size chart and could have definitely gone down a size for better compression.
4.0,These gloves are amazing.<br />I got these for my partner and he loves them. They are made nicely and look more expensive then the price they have here.<br />The only small issue is sometimes they did not work on his phone he would have to hit his screen with the gloves just right. Once he figured it out it was fine.<br /><br />These are a great Amazon find and would make an awesome gift for a loved one or just get them for yourself.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
4.0,"Well made shirt, but not as flattering as some others I have purchased."
4.0,Too tiny i should have read that these were for ears and not tongue..... my fault.
4.0,This is super comfy and plenty big enough but it doesnt come with the knot in it so I had a hard time tying it. Haha.
4.0,"Came right on time, the wording isn't as clear as the picture shows but still readable. Charm looks nice on my bracelet, its printed on both sides so it can been seen from either direction. have not worn it out yet so I don't know the durability but I think it will be fine. Can't wait to give my bestie her half."
4.0,"It‚Äôs very pretty, easy to get on and off, but there‚Äôs no instructions on what to do with the oil."
4.0,"The shirt I received was different than pictured had large Tuning fork emblem on the chest instead of the written Yamaha Racing as shown, but still liked it. Very good quality and fit as expected."
4.0,"This hoodie is amazing; I feel just like a Tauntaun every time I put it on. The material is of super high quality and is really soft, and it washes up really nicely. I just don't dry it because I don't want it to shrink. I normally wear a men's medium or women's large, and after reading the reviews I decided to get an XL, and I'm glad I did because it fits perfectly. So keep in mind this fits like a juniors size, but is not cut like a women's hoodie. The only thing I would change about this are the horns; they don't really look like traditional tauntaun horns, so I'll probably modify them when I figure out what route I want to take, but for the time being it looks alright."
4.0,These are okay. Smaller across than what I was expecting. Bought them for an upcoming cruise hoping to get a little advantage looking into the water. If it weren't for that I'd most likely be returning them as they are just a little too snug for me which will lead to headaches if worn too long. 4 stars because they seem to be well made so I would recommend but only if the person receiving is able to comfortably wear glasses off the rack without needed them sized.
4.0,"Soft, small, not that cute, but my 5yr old daughter likes it"
4.0,"It fits perfectly! I am 5'3 and weigh 146 lbs, usually wear an 8-10 and bought the large. Not too tight, not too loose, perecer for work. NOTE, the pattern does not continue to the back so I took off one star for that."
4.0,"I love this necklace. The only thing I would change would be that I would love a longer chain, but I got what I paid for."
4.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law. She liked it very much. I also bought her one in tan.
4.0,It's a little to big. And I didn't notice there was sparkly things inside the ripped parts I don't like it at all. The quality is great the value is good it's just my personal preference with the Sparkles I don't like if you like that then it would be a great Buy
4.0,"Super cute, sleeves are wider than I‚Äôd like though."
4.0,"I previously had a corset from a different company. This one material is diff than what the other was made of. It doesn't have a whole lot of stretch to it so gettting ur true size is a must. In my other corset I was a 38 but I decided to go with the 2x with this product and I'm glad I did. My other corset rolled up in the back this one I don't feel I'll have that problem. The straps are adjustable which is a plus. It does flatten everything out and it's not unbareable. I haven't worked out in it just yet but I will. It makes my boobs sit up nicely. I took pics with it over top of my shirt tho. I am 5,5 200lbs. Not sure of my waist measurements. It covers my torso area. Hope this helps!"
4.0,"So far so good. Just received this week and have worn a few times. I ordered one three pack of white and one three pack of black. As other reviewers stated the black does indeed feel like a heavier blend of the material. Strange, but true. I am about 6‚Äô1‚Äù and they are long enough for me and fit quite well as compression shirts. They wick away sweat pretty well. I‚Äôm giving these 4 stars for now only because it‚Äôs been a week and if they can hold up like my under armour I‚Äôll increase to a 5.<br /><br />One note - the white ones do have a grey stitching going through them in case someone was looking for true white."
4.0,"Bought for daughters elementary graduation. Fabric is very soft and breathable,also flows beautifully!!!"
4.0,I purchased these as a gift for a friend and she was delighted.
4.0,Even though they are a little small they are uber comfortable and so soft!
4.0,Great bought a bunch for the girls in the family so we could all just carry them instead of purses on our cruise
4.0,My son was very excited to get this and the trunk isn‚Äôt yellow like the image showed us. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great fit.
4.0,This was a good fit and made well
4.0,"Comfortable, a bit big, but it flows nice."
4.0,I like the look and light weight but still not very supportive‚Ä¶
4.0,Nice... very good.
4.0,"they are a bit tight, I ordered and got a half size large, I think they will stretch out and fit great.  sure hope so because they are bad  assed to wear.  like I said, 'love'm"""
4.0,What do you get for the fisherman who has everything? A new chair with a built in cooler.
4.0,This robe is great.  It is very soft.  I wish it was a tad bit thicker. But otherwise great!
4.0,The shirt is a gift so I haven‚Äôt tried it on but it looks to be of good quality
4.0,The color was very nice
4.0,It looks fashionableüòç
4.0,These boots are more for fashion inside wear. Order 1/2 size up. Runs short.
4.0,"Casual, flirty, fun and comfortable. What more can you ask for in a little summer dress?"
4.0,Nice...thinner than I expected..but warm enough
4.0,It's been my summer dress.  It's loose and long.  Washes well.  I'm 5'8&#34; and about 140 lbs.....
4.0,"When I first looked at this, there was an extra large available. But when I went to purchase as a reviewer, an extra large was not available. However, I have a sister who'd love it.<br /><br />It's from an Asian company so they certainly run small (buy a size up or even 2 for extra flowiness!) The fabric is a poly-blend so it has that poly feel to it, very stretchy. So, girls, if you do normally wear extra large but love tunics like I do, You could get away with wearing it with a sweater that goes past your rear and big scarf in front to hide any cling-induced frumpiness! The color was great, very much like the photo. If I were a size smaller, it'd be fantastic!"
4.0,"Very nice looking glasses that seem to be well made,  My only problem with them is that I can see my eyes when I am wearing them.  I prefer mirrors that hide my eyes completely."
4.0,"these are nice looking and comfortable tights which would be fine for running with a few caveats<br />1) I'm right on the cusp according to their size chart of a medium and large. I went with the large and while they fit quite comfortably, they certainly aren't compression tights.  So if you want compression, I'd size down.<br /><br />2) the material is thin. Which is fine for running, but I wouldn't use them for ultimate frisbee indoor and out, which is where I use several other tights. I'm pretty sure these would tear in the first game and probably pretty early in the game. That's not necessarily a knock--just an observation to know what they are and are not good for<br /><br />otherwise, they're comfortable, thin enough so you won't overheat (not for cold weather btw) and a good value for running tights"
4.0,Be careful pulling them up. They're made like thicker stockings. Each pair I wore got a run in them upon putting them on. They're really sexy tho.
4.0,"My second oldest daughter cleans houses and I got this for her on a whim when I saw it thinking it might help.  However, there is not really much to it.  She does use it and says it sort of helps, but she would rather have something a bit more substantial since this tends to shift around on her.  Its working for now, but I don't think she will use it for long."
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured though the ears will be wrinkly from how it‚Äôs packed. The nose elastic is small so it will be tight even on a kid‚Äôs face. Not sure on how long it will last but looks fine for an event or a couple play performances in our case.
4.0,"Amazing!!! I was a little hesitant just because there weren't that many reviews but I'm glad I bought it. The quality of the sweater is thick and soft on the inside. I'm 5'2"" 32-26-38 and I  ordered a M because I wanted it to be large on me and not too short. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not come with the black string to tie the sides, but it's an easy fix. Super excited to wear it!"
4.0,"Loved the color and the style! Kind of like retro I Love Lucy look. Mostly fit fine, but a little too snug (I'm &#34;blessed&#34; with being well endowed) to wear comfortably, so I had to return it."
4.0,The flares are too small compared to plugs I have purchased elsewhere.. So they fall out a lot.
4.0,They were a little larger than expected.  I wear size 10 pants and bought the large.  I should have purchased the next size down.
4.0,"Nicer than I thought, wish they had an exact jacket but with short sleeves. Ordered size up & fits well"
4.0,"This bathing suit is well-constructed, has vivid colors, and fits beautifully - It'll be my summertime staple at the beach this year. I arrived on time and in perfect condition. I received this item at a discounted price, as I am part of the Amazon product review process."
4.0,"I was looking for a simple cover up and this was a great option at a great price. I'm a 34D so the Medium was a bit tight i the chest (if I wear a padded swim top under it, it's a little tight through the chest and armpits."
4.0,"I love this bag, and would give it 5 stars except that the lining stitching on one of the inner pockets is already coming undone. Because I have lots of little bags inside to organize it, that's not a huge problem.<br /><br />This is my to-go-and-not-get-bored bag. It holds a lot, and the outside and shoulder strap are both stylish and sturdy. The inner pockets are kind of useless though. Just a wee bit the wrong size, for my stuff at least, and a little too shallow to actually keep pens or pencils in without catching on everything and being pulled out."
4.0,Very comfortable. Great fit. Very well made I personally don‚Äôt like the look it has on me but that is my fault.
4.0,Didn't like how it fit....return
4.0,Great Pants to go to the beach very comfortable :)
4.0,Product was great just didn't fit around my eyes. I wore it like a head peace.
4.0,"Received through Vine for an honest review.<br />Ordered a 2X and the pair I received are quite small.<br />Size is closer to a regular Large.<br />Therefore, unable to submit an accurate review."
4.0,"Picked up a pair of these 2 winters ago for 15 dollars. In retrospect I would have paid around 30-35 as they have been excellent. Warm, comfortable around the house, and I have even ventured outside with them a bit which leads me to my next point. They have started to fall apart as the sole is tearing away from the upper and the elastic band is worn...for roughly 50 cents a month i thought they were well worth it."
4.0,Well I ordered this for my wife and she liked it! The top she said is a bit loose when you include the pad so she removed it and seems satisfied with the improved fit. I find she looks good in it and it looks better in real than on the model (of course).
4.0,"I bought the dark teal and its such a pretty color. The V-Neck is very deep, you'll have to wear a shirt underneath it. It's not very warm but its incredibly comfy. I thought it was a bit smaller than I wanted, but It's cute. It a lot more stretchy than I wanted too, but it's a good hoodie to throw on."
4.0,"Loved the look of this dress, but it was super sheer.  Had to make sure there was a slip on underneath.  Material was very wrinkly.  Had to have it pressed before wear, simple run through the dryer didn‚Äôt get all the wrinkles out."
4.0,it is very pretty & colorful.  But i was searching for items for a baby - 3 months old.  This is clearly for a grown child - way too big.  Can't use it right now - will have to set aside for when she's much bigger.
4.0,"The tights look and feel great, except only one pair came in the package when the item description says it should contain 2 pairs!"
4.0,"Would give it 5 stars, but unlike the khaki colored version of this hat that I also own, the dark brown hat is subject to sweat stains. Otherwise, great hat for the price."
4.0,Large size just right. I‚Äôd say the jacket runs small as the measurements indicated I‚Äôd wear a MediumüôÑ
4.0,"The lenses are a very chromatic mirror blue hue and I kinda wished they were see thru to some degree. I'm okay with them though. They were more for driving than looks and being they're polarized, they do a great job at dissipating the haze and enhancing view clarity. There are rubberized inlays on the underside of the arms for gripping your melon so they don't slide around. Not a big fan of the tips of the arms being able to touch the lens so they could've at least coated them in rubber, but time will tell."
4.0,"I recieved this article in 2 weeks exactly, the heart it's a little small for me but that's okay. The key is small but the finish is nice. I think is to expensive for what it is but if you give to some special person, it's ok."
4.0,"I wear a Large but I ordered a 2XL because I wanted it to fit like that. Well I‚Äôm glad I got the 2XL because it fits like a Large, it‚Äôs slightly tight still. I definitely recommend going up 2 sizes"
4.0,"Nice, but oversized.  Recommend ordering one size smaller than normal."
4.0,Top fits fine but the bottoms run small. Colors are vibrant and the top is comfortable to wear.
4.0,"They actually fit really nice; always nervous when I order a pair of sunglasses because I can‚Äôt try them on, for for $10 these are legit!<br /><br />I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars because they sit too far off the face!"
4.0,"cute! love it, not exactly like the one from the movie. this one is more heart shaped than that. but i still love it!"
4.0,I got these specifically to wear in my yard and not worry about them getting wet from the pool. I‚Äôm a size 8 and the 7-8 slides fit me perfectly.
4.0,"Beautiful colors on this dress! It came super fast. I was expecting/wanting cotton (guess I didn't read the description), but I still love it! I wore it to a wedding, and got tons of compliments in person, and on my photos. I'm petite, so it was a bit long (and the sleeves reached my wrists, instead of being &#34;three-quarter length&#34;), but nothing too difficult to handle. I ordered a 2XL, and it was true to size and fit great.<br />P.S. - I'm the one in the photo *not* wearing a bridal gown ;)"
4.0,"My husband loves this belt. It is great especially because we eat a keto diet and losing a few pounds here and there he doesn‚Äôt need to replace belt, just cut a little more off.  It looks nice. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because it seems the buckle is a ‚Äúleft handed buckle‚Äù?  He is right handed but when he puts buckle on right side the design is upside down"
4.0,Beautiful saree.
4.0,"It is quite pretty.  I bought it as a gift, so I don't know the how the recipient feels yet.  The rings are much smaller than I expected.  I don't remember if that information was part of the description, but I was surprised when I opened it.  The largest ring is less than 1/2&#34; and the smallest is less than 1/4&#34;. That would have been good information to have."
4.0,"Perfect for the occasion. Only issue, the beads came off easily."
4.0,"I purchased this watch and when it arrived I was shocked!! It looked awesome, keeps time perfectly and was very inexpensive. It can be worn with jeans or business suits. I own high dollar watches that don't look as appealing. LOL"
4.0,Works very well to organize all the computer accessories.  I can see quickly which ones are missing when I pack up.
4.0,I've been wanting a velvet dress for a while and thought christmas would be a good excuse to get one. After looking through amazon and reading the reviews I decided to get this in a large. I can normally wear lrg or xl but based on everyone saying it runs big I went with the large. It fit and is cute. I got a bunch of complements. My only things against the dress is if you're not careful when you sit or bend you flash your chest bc of how loose it's made and then it's a bit longer than I'd prefer. Other than those 2 things I'm happy with my purchase!
4.0,"Flattering cut, hides &#34;tummy&#34; area nicely!  Shorts are a good length!"
4.0,"The band holder on the link remover is cheap plastic.  Also, It is too narrow to remove pins from any larger size bands...men or women's.  The other tools that are included are ok and appear to get the job done.  I haven't used the wrench, so can't comment on it.  I ended up using the hammer and pin punch to get the pin out of my wife's ceramic band.  Worked great.  Would recommend for occasional usage."
4.0,Cute nitey. The bottoms seem to be a larger fit than the top
4.0,"So far I really do love this skirt.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this skirt is longer than on the model or if it's just because it's a size too big. I don't know if it'll shrink in the wash, but I would order a size down.<br /><br />It also creases kinda bad. It was all janky when I got it."
4.0,This band works differently than the traditional Milanese band.  I like how it closes but it is not sized for people with large hands.  It will fit any wrist fine but doesn‚Äôt slide over my hands easily.
4.0,Mixed feelings about this type of bra. I am a 36 DD and I believe I ordered large based off of other reviews. I am glad I did bc it will start to stretch out after a few uses and it'll stretch into the right size. The pads inside are a joke to me and that's my only complaint. They made tiny pads that don't cover very much and they're thick. I will be replacing them with spare ones I already own. I bought these for off the shoulder tops and maxi dresses bc strapless bras dig into my ribs. This serves its purspose.
4.0,Love the print and it fits perfectly! Really good quality material as well!
4.0,"I bought this for a specific event and it fulfilled my needs.  I would have liked it to be a lighter color, many of the pins are hard to see clearly with the dark color scheme, but it is true to the picture."
4.0,"Thinner material than I expected, but not see through. Beautiful colors."
4.0,"I received this pair and immediately fell in love with it, unfortunately I lost them shortly after receiving them, due to the high volume of sunglasses that were coming in (I went a little crazy :3). Material is consistant with price so take good care of this and it's a steal!"
4.0,These were great! They fit perfect and are pretty good quality. I loved that the bottom side has grips on the gloves so it made it easier to hold things.
4.0,"Very lightweight and looks nice. Little TIGHT to be a WIDE.<br /><br />Had debated returning them but I‚Äôm going to see if they loosen up after break in.<br /><br />Timberland Pros are very good boots but for this price I figured why not try something cheaper out and see what happens.<br /><br />::UPDATE::<br /><br />The fitment is still tight in the toe box but still am glad I bought these. VERY lightweight and comfortable and for the price it‚Äôs worth trying these out.<br /><br />I‚Äôve gotten them wet and haven‚Äôt had any leaks. But not submerged. They need boot oil very soon due to the type of work I do. A lot of wear and tear but I‚Äôm hoping to get 6 months out of them.<br /><br />The insulation properties aren‚Äôt ideal but adequate for spring and fall weather if working outside. I will be using my insulated boots this winter as these will not be adequate.<br /><br />I hope this brand makes more options available like different widths, soles, and insulation properties."
4.0,"On one side of the shades, the &#34;Kush&#34; is upside down & has small Dink's on it. Other than that my boyfriend loves it."
4.0,when i ordered it i thought it was a faux leather legging but i still like it.
4.0,It's a Xmas present for my granddaughter I think it's going to keep her very warm this winter.
4.0,"You know what they say about men with big feet......they need big socks. I wear a size 12 medium shoe and these things are tight. Very light weight, synthetic, would be good for summer wear."
4.0,"Ordered to wear as a beach cover up.  While the colors were vibrant and pretty, it wasn't quite right for me (as a cover up at least).  It also was shorter than shown in the pic (and I am 5'2). It could be cute with leggings or jeans (or maybe even shorts).  At the end of the day, it wasn't for me-- but it's not a bad item.<br />Fit: a little on the small side, shorter than the pic<br />Fabric: polyester feeling<br />Color: as pictured, vibrant and pretty"
4.0,"Nice fabric, fits very well. Ordered same size as i wear in regular cloths. Will order more."
4.0,"My 5 year old loves this costume, of course, but the material isn't great and it came super wrinkled and bunched up. The tulle(?) overlay was hard to get straightened out because it was so wrinkled. We also used different wings with the costume. The ones that come with it are pretty cheap."
4.0,"I do love this dress,  but it runs huge.  I'm usually a medium, but more towards a large.  With small upper body and larger hips.  Size 10 shirt, 14 pants 5'8, 175lbs. Bottom heavy.  I need a small,  and I even think the bottom of that dress may still be too large. The chest is very full,  maybe better for a larger chested woman.  I'm 36B, barely."
4.0,I like the way it looks and it‚Äôs waterproof. Only issue is that the strap to tie ripped off on the first day I used it.
4.0,Dan post boots fit great very comfortable lit t
4.0,These have decent reaction to sunlight. They are not very dark when fully activated.  I use them for mountain biking on wooded trails. The orange tint seems good for This purpose.<br /><br />It is ironic that replacement lenses cost about the same as the original sunglasses. Not uncommon though
4.0,one for every vehicle figure every little bit helps today in this world
4.0,"I ordered this product for a costume (Glee zombie...don't ask) I was putting together on a moments notice. When it arrived I was slightly confused because the package was so small, but once I opened it up the tutu unfolded and was pretty much what I was looking for. The only real problem I had with the product was that the photo made it look like it was made of a soft sheer material instead of the tulle the coarser tulle it was made of. This wasn't necessarily a problem for my costume, but it just was something that surprised me when I opened the package."
4.0,just add a few inches to the sides
4.0,"In the eternal quest for the perfect shoulder bag, I keep trying different things. I wanted a vertical messenger style so as to not be so wide and get hung up in doorways and in the aisle on planes. I have an issue with using the left side of my body, so need a bag I can sling cross-body and access with one hand; no flap across the pockets. The distressed leather avoids it looking ""too pretty"" and just out of a photo-shoot. My only request would be for the same bag but 1 1/2-2"" deeper (front to back) to hold more stuff."
4.0,Like It.
4.0,"Very pretty dress, it is exactly as pictured. The sizing is good.  The first time I tried it on the sequins rubbed against the area right below the armpit causing redness and discomfort. I was short on time so I kept the dress and was mindful while wearing it.  I don't know if others have experienced this or maybe my skin in that area is sensitive to the material, (never has happened before though). Other than that, it's a nice dress."
4.0,"Very nice shoes, I would just order a half size or whole size up from your usual size."
4.0,The color and fabric were as expected! Good and beautiful!
4.0,"Great shirt for the price point! Fabric is slightly thin, but not abnormally sheer. great stretch to the fabric for a nice fit."
4.0,"I bought one for my son, and he loves it. It‚Äôs a classic look and small and lightweight. The functions are pretty easy to learn. The only issue is the built in light is very poor. Almost not worth having, but I guess in pitch black environments it kind of helps you see the time."
4.0,I love the size and the style of this bag.  It's easy to toss items in and find them again since the front and back are are through.  The only down side.is.It only has a small enclosure on it.  I would be worried my items would fall out
4.0,MY boyfriend loves it! It looks so much better in person. So far so good.
4.0,"I disliked the way I looked in this dress, but that is not the manufacturers fault, that being said, I washed and machine dried it and it shrunk maybe an inch in length.  No wrinkles if you remove it immediately from dryer.  The pockets are at your hips, so they add to the width of your hips. If you have a perfect shape, or just don't care if every little bulge shows then this is for you.  I will use it as a night gown, once I remove the scratchy tag from the back."
4.0,I love this skirt but it runs large. I ordered an large and the tag says 1x but bag says XL. Either way it's to lose but even lose its cute and makes my shape look amazing! Will be ordering another in Large. I'm 5 9 and weigh 180 and it came well pass my knee even though I have big thighs. And it made my stomach look flat.
4.0,This is a great uv option for my little one. It's soft and breathable and can wear it even if it's hot out with out getting overheated. I bought the 6-12 month size and the sleeves are pretty long. But she uses them to cover her hands which helps with sunburn.
4.0,Very nice watch well worth the money and the quality is great.
4.0,"Maybe a little small for my 5 year old. Very high quality product, though."
4.0,This shirt is comfortable. I'd like it just a bit longer.
4.0,"cute summer dress, but with lining, too much material for a coverup."
4.0,the jacket feels really nice but its just a little tight around the neck and the tie dye wasn't that well done.
4.0,Good quality though not comfy
4.0,Thin but cute!
4.0,"The leather is nice. The purse is small, but it holds the necessities. My biggest dislike is the strap. The strap is long enough, but it's too narrow. I'm going to keep the purse because the positives outweigh the few negatives."
4.0,Cute and fits as expected.
4.0,"For what you get this price is incredible, the quality is low and these will Dye your fingers if not careful, but for the price, that is expected."
4.0,"The dress is nice! The fabric is not super thin which was impressive. Doesn't seem cheap. Stretchy material. Pockets are a nice addition. My measurements are 35 1/2"" waist, 37"" hips! I am 138lbs and I'm 5'2'. The length hits me a little above the heel. I got a small and I'm 6 1/2 months pregnant with PLENTLY of room to grow throughout rest of pregnancy without over-stretching material. The dress is flowy. I am pleased!"
4.0,"This scarf is very pretty, but the fabric is thinner than I had expected. The color is also less bold than I hoped. But it is still very pretty."
4.0,"I absolutely love my necklace.  The chain is a little thin, but the monogram piece is stunning.  I get lots of compliments on it.  I've had it since 10/14/2016, & have had no issues thus far.  I ordered the 18&#34; silver tone chain.  I probably will get a 16&#34; chain next, with the 10% off coupon that they gave me!"
4.0,"I love these. The only downside is the fogginess that ensues,"
4.0,The little one loves it
4.0,"Weight less, tuff and stiff"
4.0,"What a great find this is!  Runs large. I ordered the small (I have 27 inch waist and 37.5 inch hips) and will have to alter it slightly as there is much more extra fabric at the waist & hips than I need.  The 1+ inch elastic waist band closes with a large swatch of velcro and has an additional draw string (for extra security?).  The tulle layers are quite stiff and will work well under heavier fabrics. Well sewn with finished seams.  I was a bit puzzled when I unpacked it until I realized it was shipped inside out. Great way to contain all that tulle the next time I pack.<br /><br />Bridal/formal wear boutiques are pretty proud of their under garments--at least their pricing makes it seem so.  I was stunned at the low price this is currently being offered (May 2016) and was even more blown away to be offered an additional discount by the seller in return for my opinion of the petticoat.  The down & dirty version: this petticoat offers marvelous fullness AND offered in black with extended sizing, at a darned good price."
4.0,Very nice earrings and not heavy.
4.0,i think i bought the medium...i normally wear a 6.5 medium width...have had them for a few months and no complaints..they are very cute and comfortable....they have held up pretty well with almost daily use surprised to hear others complain about quality..no probelms so far for me..
4.0,Love them! Great to put stuff in for my customers. üòä
4.0,"Size a bit off, but still ok."
4.0,"I ordered the gray and absolutely love it! I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and the legs were long and even had extra room to ‚Äúscrunch‚Äù a little on the calf and ankle. It is a loose fit so if you want it fitted, go down a size. I wanted it to be loose for lounging. Since I loved the gray so much I decided to order the burgundy. Well... I hate the burgundy. The gray is more of a cotton feel and very comfortable. The burgundy is straight shiny polyester ( you know the one that gets snags). I‚Äôm sending it back. I wish they were all more of the cotton feel. If the cheap polyester material is not a deal breaker for you, then this is a great, cheap, comfy outfit. If you prefer the cotton feel only order the gray one. It‚Äôs still a cheaply made outfit...but that is mainly because uhm...it‚Äôs cheap. It is comfortable, you can still step outside wearing it, it is not see through and if you mess it up...it was under $30 for the set. I might order another set in gray...but definitely not the burgundy."
4.0,"Love the overall look of it, very different from the popular plastic bands. It matches the rose gold face of the watch, but I was expecting it to be Gold gold. Easy to put on and to my surprise the magnet are very strong, my 7th month old baby pulls on it and it doesn‚Äôt come off (it might misalign but it won‚Äôt fall off. Good buy, recommend"
4.0,"This is the second time I‚Äôve ordered these sunglasses. I bought 2 pairs for my kids last summer and they loved them. They are lightweight so my girls are comfortable wearing them and they quickly got used to wearing them all the time when outside. One pair was in the bottom of our pool bag and when I got them out for this spring, the frame had broken. Maybe they broke and I wasn‚Äôt told, but I wasn‚Äôt too pleased to have to buy another pair when I thought they were just in storage. However, I bought the same ones since my girls love them and I want them to wear them as much as possible."
4.0,nice very helpful
4.0,Really pretty and simple. Great for the price. The only negative is the edges are not rounded at all. Completely sharp like boxed edges. Still a great bracelet though.
4.0,I really like them but they are a little tight. I believe that they are stretching a bit as I'm wearing them.
4.0,They battery only lasts about 4 hours then you need to recharge.
4.0,"Son muy delicadas,pero hace la funci√≥n. Me gustaron."
4.0,"Really cute dress for summer! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 123 pounds and the medium for perfect. Not to right but not to baggy. Love it!"
4.0,We were vacationing in Florida and the people we went there to see had one like this on his camera. I liked it so well that when we returned home I ordered one up for me. I'm really impressed by the functionality of this product.
4.0,These gaiters are definitely more for an adult man large face.  I got them for myself and teenage football players.  Too big.
4.0,It is hard to and the underneath of the hook is kind of rough on the skin but it is very pretty.
4.0,"These are very comfortable pants. I got XL and they fit as expected, the legs are a tiny bit too long but they aren't a huge deal to me. I'm 5'3 and 200 pounds. They're a tad see-through though, so keep that in mind. I didn't notice until I was at the gym and bent over to grab something and realized my bright underwear were showing through quite a bit. Not a deal breaker as I like to layer, but some might be annoyed."
4.0,One size fits all type of costume but difficult to keep the hood on. It worked for our family frog theme and was very comfortable.
4.0,It is a little too large. But it is attractive. I need to &#34;work&#34; with the sizing so that it doesn't look so large.
4.0,"It's very cute, looks just like the picture. The stone just moves around a little and you and hear it clicking."
4.0,"Washes in dishwasher, soft on the feet and good arch support.  Not stylish, but great on the feet."
4.0,"Listed as a cotton blend, I'd say likely 35% cotton, if that much - soft fabric, lightweight (perforated texture) dries faster. If I place it farther back, it will cover the tops of my shoulders. I pulled out the dotted scarf and, using the large safety pin trick, threaded through something more substantial - the chin cord also helps to &quot;customize&quot; the fit. The inner circle (crown?) is 7&quot; in diameter, the hat itself 22&quot; - a straight &quot;primer&quot; gray, not blue, purple, or green-gray, and will not show a water stain even after using a chlorinated pool. I prefer cotton, but I like this one more than I expected I would - have to wonder how the fabric will hold up over a full season."
4.0,"Because I read reviews that legs were tighter than expected, I ordered 2 sizes bigger. But then the suit is so long that the skull head/hoodie part stands up over my head like a tent. Maybe I can fix through sewing.  Thighs are still snugger than I would have expected given the size I ordered. But it has bones on both front and back which is cool, and it glows in the dark like crazy. If I can alter the hood then I‚Äôll be happy."
4.0,"Wish the blue more on blue side, not grayish , other wise nice fit."
4.0,I am giving it 4stars because the material is awesome and for the price. I am usually a medium so I follow my mind and ordered the large it for good.
4.0,"I LOVE the way this dress looks. The pattern printed on the fabric is stunning. It is a digital printed image on the dress. The colors are beautiful. It has a lot of shades of blue, pink, purple, and white. It looks just like the pictures you see from outer space. This dress is fun and flirty. It has a very slim fit on the upper body. The back is a racer back. The bottom is a flared skirt. The fabric is a polyester and spandex blend. It is pretty stretchy.<br />I am 5‚Äô6.5‚Äù tall and about 130 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. The dress is slightly short. It is a few inches above my knees. It looks great on. The racer back works well with my racer back bras. You can occasionally see the strap peek out when I move certain ways, but for the most part my straps stay hidden. The only issue I have with this dress is that the hem is not hemmed. It is just the cut fabric edge and over time it may fray after being washed and worn. I wish they would have sewn a hem on this. Overall this dress is really fun and cute. The colors are vibrant and the pattern is unique and not something you see every day. I love wearing it.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Buy for a gift,very cute"
4.0,Tihs is so cute!
4.0,The case pictured is not the one I received.  I received a red zebra print case which is fine and isn't a big deal for me anyways.  after about a month of using the sunglasses the silver &#34;DG&#34; piece had fallen off.
4.0,"I have a similar band from Fitbit and this one is nice but doesn't have something protecting the clasps (that clip the band to the Fitbit) like the authentic metal Fitbit band has.  Maybe i'm ultra sensitive but it rubs and makes it uncomfortable.  I don't feel like going through the hassle to return it and will wear it occasionally but will likely not order one again.  Besides that, it is nice and seems to be made well.<br /><br />Edited to add a STAR as the seller will be refunding $5.00 for my problem.  Extra star for customer service."
4.0,I expected the color to be a brighter red.....not so much this diller red!!
4.0,"Nice thumb ring, or for whichever finger you choose.  Striking, yet simple."
4.0,I love the pattern of the material-- but wish it was more cottony.  but I'm keeping it.!!
4.0,"So cute, got a small & i am about 100-105lbs. No breasts and these felt rather tight. I would size up but then they would likely be too big for me..."
4.0,"For such a low price, you really can't beat it. It's a simple cheap watch, but the look of it is kind of cool for a casual, no-frills aesthetic.<br /><br />The one caveat is the backlight - it's uneven and not very bright. But it does the job, and for the price, who can complain?"
4.0,"I love the earrings, they are pretty!"
4.0,"Quality is ok, runs very small.  I wouldn't have bought them if I could have tried them on first.  It was a great price and hardly worth returning after paying for shipping, so I will keep them.  It's the smallest XL I've seen."
4.0,Very comfortable  and it doesn't slide around your wrist. Easy to read and a nice fashion accessory.
4.0,"This pack they are calling an Assault Pack and Mountaineering pack. This is a very durable and tactical looking backpack. You can practically use this backpack for anything. You can use it for work, play, hiking, camping, every day use. This is literally covered in molle webbing. What I really like is the color of it. The photos on the listing do not do it justice.<br />This is completely covered in Molle. It seems to be water resistant but definitely not waterproof. The inside is covered with some PVC type coating that is water resistant. But the outside will get soaked.<br /><br />This pack is fully hydration bladder ready. It does have a pocket in the main compartment for that. The main compartment is really room. It can also be accessed from the bottom.<br /><br />Now there are some cons. The shoulder straps have absolutely no padding. If you are going to use this for hiking, they will definitely start hurting. You can help relieve that by adding padding like those seatbelt straps to it. The molle is not uniform. Molle should be every 1 inch. This has some uneven stitching making some molle wider or smaller. The compartment for the bladder does not have a Velcro strap or hook to hang the bladder. So once you drink your water, the bag will start to sag down. The two bladder tube holes on either side are too small. It can fit the tube thru as long as you take off the mouth piece first. There seems to be a rigid piece of plastic acting kind of like an internal frame. However it is too flimsy that it starts to sag if you don‚Äôt have your back fully packed. And going back to the Molle straps, it is sewn on to the netting so for anything medium weight, it is useless.<br /><br />Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do like this bag. It does have its flaws. But I‚Äôve come across bags like this before. Comparing it to a 5.11 or Maxpedition pack, this is a very cheap and good alternative. Over time, the stiffness will wear down. I would still recommend this pack as long as you know what you are getting and how to work with it.<br /><br />To be completely transparent, I offer full disclosure about my purchase: I did receive this particular item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, 100% true and unbiased review. This in no way affects my how I feel about this product nor deters my honest opinion of this item."
4.0,Top is a tad to big but bottoms fit perfectly! I got the two peice. Really wish the top wasn't so BIG! Keeping it because it still looks ultra cute! :D
4.0,Great for the cat Enthusiast your cat lover however like I said in an earlier the years on the one ring or hard to see when you have it on your finger and the quality isn't quite what I expected but still a very good present overall
4.0,"I am a mens 12 shoe and they fit me fine.  My only complaint is that they seem to pill inside and I have to turn the socks inside out to get the excess material out.  Outside of that, they are comfortable and a good thickness."
4.0,I love the fact that is slimming. Got many compliments for it making me look thinner. Yay! Definitely a great buy and will order more in different colors.
4.0,"I knew after looking at them in the store that these shorts  for some odd reason run a lot small. I am a extra medium, that means I range from a medium to a large depending on manufacturing. I have a 33&#34; waist. The med in the store looks like they could fit a 12 year old boy. I ordered the xl and they seem to fit fairly well. Still a little tight but I guess that's the point. They must have manufactured these in Thailand for Thai men not for North American or Europeans."
4.0,"Nice, light weight sun glasses!"
4.0,I had to size up 1 size in this shirt. It fit great though! It is a very soft material and feels so good to wear! The sleeves are not overbearing even though they are flowy.  I love that the material has a bit of stretch to it. This shirt looks great when paired with the very popular leggings that are out right now.  I have washed on gentle and had no issues with shrinking.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,I‚Äôve had these for 2 years now and they are still functioning. These work really well during 12 hour shifts. Side note I even used it to reduce swelling recently when I sprained my ankle. It even helped stabilize my ankle  and I walked a lot better with them on. The only bad part is once I take it off my legs are itchy for a minute or so and indents from the print are left on my skin.
4.0,"The material is very heavy, not cheap at all.  I am 5'5, 215, 40DDD, the length was perfect if wearing a wedge.  it may barely drag if you wear flats.  It fit me just fine.  I just did not find the fit flattering and the color itself did not look good on me, I am going to reorder in gray.  It is a nice looking dress, especially for the price."
4.0,"I love the dress,but  because Im chesty its  sort waisted,and I wouldn't go anywhere with out a thick belt.And its is itchy."
4.0,so comfy and cute. really really happy
4.0,[[VIDEOID:582ff128738807acc435faa6db4afa7f]] I feel like it should be cheaper but it looks great. Its so pretty.
4.0,"I am giving them 4 instead of 5 because they are very cheaply made, and I gave them 4 instead of 3 because they are super cute.  Just be careful with them they are not substantial and can't handle a lot of abuse"
4.0,very high neckline i sometimes roll the top. The material gets caught on things but is nice and thick. Worth buying
4.0,I got exactly what I thought. They're sheer and sexy. The quality is fairly good for the price which is minimal on a per pair basis so I had a low bar. Washed in a garment bag just to be safe.
4.0,beautiful just a tad too small for good size cell phone
4.0,"Versatile dress.  I am tall and wish it was an inch longer,  but still pretty"
4.0,"The product is smaller than I expected and I had to wait a long time for it. While the quality is fine and I'm happy with my purchase, the wait was a little more than I expected since it had to be mailed from China. It took nearly six weeks to arrive. Though I believe it is not the fault of the seller,  I will think very carefully before I order another item from China. That's just too long to wait for an item."
4.0,It goes especially well with mock and actual turtleneck tops.
4.0,This shirt is cute.  It is very thin though.  I like the pattern and the look of the shirt.  It would be nicer if it was a little bit thicker.  It is comfortable.
4.0,my wife love is it
4.0,"Made a Cunard cruise memorable. Dressed for formal night with a new accent every time! The ties look fine, may not last but who cares."
4.0,Good product for the price. Bought it as a gift...she loved it. However still not sure what the large zipper on the outside is for. You can't really put anything in it and still have it snap shut.
4.0,"I think the style is best for teens through young adult. I have the Size Small and it's pretty slim cut, so if you're curvy at all, I recommend ordering up. I'm 5'9"" and about 124 pounds and small in the chest. The Size Small is just barely comfortable on me. If it shrinks at all when washing, it won't fit me.  I vary between Medium and Small, and chose the small because of how big it looks on the model. If you want the loose, oversize feel that the current model displays, you may need to order 2 sizes up.<br /><br />FABRIC: Thin, soft and sewn well. This is not a warm, winter hoodie, but more of a casual shirt with a hood. The middle seam where the color changes is actually an overlap of material. This was hard for me to tell from the image. I worry that over time, this edge will begin to curl and not lay flat. The sleeve transitions from one color to another are sewn seams, so there is no overlap like you have on the torso. This additional sewing also gives an edge to the sleeves that you wouldn't have if it was just a solid fabric where they would dye the color change. This all adds to the style and makes me feel like it's a good fit for the young teens to young adults.<br /><br />HOOD and TIES: The hood is fairly large, wide neck area, but lays flat nicely when worn. The ties are high quality with a bit of decoration which gives an overall trendy feel.<br /><br />COLOR: I have the burgendy gray. It's a nice shade for casual wear and the color blocks make this a more interesting, fashionable hoodie shirt.  - Overall, I recommend for younger ages."
4.0,Very nice piece of jewelry. Exactly what I had in mind
4.0,"we bought this for a short trip, they seem to be okay to last for a few days. the material is very cheap - it's a ""foam"" similar to those sheets of foam that kids cut shapes out of for art projects. but the price is low as well. fit well on his chubby feet, velcroes long enough to adjust, soles are soft rubber and are non slip. size seems true. i will give an update after the trip."
4.0,"I loved the fit of the dress, unfortunately it was completely see through so I had to return. Going to buy in a darker color!"
4.0,Good quality.  My husband is very happy with these.
4.0,"Love the fit, perfect for work or a run to the supermarket. I weigh about 140lbs. My size is usually 8US. But I ordered US10-12/Asian Tag XL. Comfy, breathy and stylish."
4.0,I tried the shirt on when I received it and it fits fine. I haven't worn it yet.
4.0,"All of the rings were super cute. They just run very small. Style, colors, price, are really great. If it fits you, it would be a good purchase. I‚Äôm giving them to my friends 13 year old. Very nice product."
4.0,It‚Äôs fine. I have to squeeze my wallet into it and it‚Äôs not easy getting it out. But it‚Äôs fine for a more dressy occasion. Not for shopping trips.
4.0,Cute shirt. Good value. A bit smaller than expected. Order one size up and enjoy a cute top.
4.0,"The one thing all these compression sox have in common is not only the amazing colors they come in but the tags the sellers use are all the same. Let me inform you.  These do help with swelling limbs, I'd say about 40% of the swelling goes down. I don't see any real significant changes in circulation or when running. In fact I don't see or feel it at all.  But with all the great fun designs and colors they come in, at least they are aesthetically pleasing. The fabric is reasonably durable. Not really soft but  that's due to the lack of cotton. Still comfortable as cotton though. I wear them 4 out of the 7 days a week. This color looks brighter on the amazon than it is when they arrive."
4.0,"Top was perfect size, but shorts are pretty large."
4.0,These sports bras come in great colors and are very comfortable. I found the sizing to be spot on. I'd say they are medium impact. My only slight qualm is that they have a removable pad. I like having the padding and would probably prefer them to be permanent. Other than that great purchase and would buy again.
4.0,LOOKS JUST LIKE PICTURE BUT BUNNY RABBIT EARS NEEDS ADJUSTING AND HEADBAND WILL COME OFF EASILY LIKE IF U LOOK DOWN OR TILT YA HEAD YES IT WILL COME OFF LOL
4.0,"Very cute top. Sleeves could be longer, but overall it is nice."
4.0,"My J.Ferrar (JC Penny) cotton slacks fit well at a 42-inch waist, but these Ralph Lauren pants have a special waist that extends up to two more inches for &#34;stretch fit&#34;. This makes them a little larger around the waist, but still managable. I would suggest that a potential buyer purchase a size that is two inches smaller than their current slack waist size when buying these slacks."
4.0,"smallish, but they work for now"
4.0,Soft & cute! They shed tho!!
4.0,"It's an umbrella, what can I say."
4.0,"Really like the watch; rugged, functional and good looking."
4.0,Me encantaron ! Son muy lindos y c√≥modos!
4.0,I was skeptical because my breasts are big and usually when I get dresses I always look disproportionate or top heavy (I'm a 40G for reference). This dress kept my girls in place (with a little adjusting). Compliments my figure and fits really good. I got an XL.
4.0,Would of liked them to fit my 5 and 8 year old granddaughters a little better.<br />We use them for dress up play days<br />Quality was very good<br />Would buy again
4.0,"We received the sweater and it is almost exactly what we saw in the photos. The fabric of the product in the hands is felt as we imagined from the photographs. Fortunately, the quality of modern photography, quality of item photos on Amazon online shops is high and a lot can be understood from them. I'm glad that this long sleeve knitted sweater is 65 percent cotton and 35 percent polyester. It's quite good-looking, of decent quality, with good colors and clearly hardy and I think that it will not deteriorate soon. Although we'll see it over time. I give the product a maximum of four stars because of the overpriced. I bought this sweater at a good discount. Without this discount, I would never have bought it."
4.0,Just as advertised. Love it.
4.0,"The top is not as long as I expected based on the picture. It comes almost down to her hips in pic but it stops around my navel (I'm short, only 5'2&#34;).  It's a little too short and wide but it's still cute. I like it and will definitely wear it! It'll make for a cute cover up!"
4.0,This is a very beautiful dress.  Very well made.  It does not have a liner to the dress so you have to wear a camisole under it if you want to.  The only reason why I gave it a 4 star rating was because it had an odor so bad I had to wash it twice and buy special detergent to get the smell out of it.  After the 2nd wash it does not smell anymore.  I did wash it by itself on hand wash and at the coldest water setting as indicated on the tag.  I hung it to dry and will need to steam it due to wrinkles.
4.0,"Alright so when I ordered this I was pissed about the shipping! I placed my order on Sept 8th and the shipping said it would be to me between Oct 4-21. Huge range in time!! I was not happy but there was nothing I could do, I received the item today Sept 29 so earlier than the shipping estimate but still three weeks of waiting.<br /><br />I ordered the medium I'm 5'11 and 150lbs and it fit awesome! I'm glad I didn't go bigger or smaller. I typically wear small/medium. The Material feels a little heavy and is longer than I thought it would be.<br /><br />It is see through if you hold it in the light but I'm pretty sure I can get away with wearing it with nothing underneath because it's black, so dark enough you can't tell it's see through unless you took it off. I'll show you in a photo I post so please look at that. I do love the way it fits and it's great for me. If you are heavy chested or want a lighter color do NOT order this. But if you are small chested and want this in black grab it! Overall I love the shirt just wish it was a different material like cotton. It has zero % cotton."
4.0,Beautiful color and texture but I would have preferred the material to be a little bit tighter.
4.0,Great buy for the price... sized up as they run a tad small and I don‚Äôt like tight clothes... on the bit of ‚Äúwild‚Äù in color and print but it works and is very fun and cute.
4.0,it was cool but the only problem that the sise I got for my wife it was not made right
4.0,Handsome and fully functional.
4.0,"they sparkle nicely, but I wish they were a little larger so you could see the snakes better."
4.0,"Great buy, they are very huge a &#34;tacky&#34; but I got them for that. They look exactly as pictured, they are somewhat wide though and there was a scratch but not one that effected my vision."
4.0,Very cute charm.
4.0,"This fit as expected- wasn't too long (I'm 5'5"") and I threw a belt on with it- i didn't have to hem it. The sleeves were pretty loose though, but the words were printed correctly (I saw on some other reviews that the HO! was backwards.)"
4.0,Mine is very pretty but it's solid silver without the black weathered letters. I'm hoping with time it will darken some.
4.0,Love the fit not in love with the length
4.0,"It's a really good high quality shirt.  Unfortunately, my arms could not fit through the arm holes.  I work out a fair amount so I understand it, but it is otherwise a really good shirt."
4.0,"These are exactly as pictured. Beautiful, sturdy earrings and they haven‚Äôt faded."
4.0,"Works great for my pebble. I have slightly larger than average sized wrists and it is too tight. I ordered a second for the links. the black finish also wears off. it doesn't bug me, but it is very noticeable. it is a good band otherwise, and the price was great."
4.0,"Useful measurements:<br /><br />Body: width of a US Nickel<br />Gap between screws entirely closed (all the way in) 4-4.5mm<br />Inner diameter of body: 17.5-18mm<br />Body height: 6mm<br />Edge of body to screw hole: 1.5mm<br />Weight: 7g (roughly 0.2 Oz)<br />Screw material: steel<br />Screw balls: believed to be nickel<br />Body ring: believed to be nickel (non-magnetic, looks like nickel).<br /><br />They're not what I expected whatsoever, they're a lot smaller and very light. Hence why I'm including more useful measurements here.<br /><br />I'm a guy who stretches a lot and thought they would be a good addition to the arsenal. They're slightly difficult to get on. They're even more difficult to center (if that matters).<br /><br />See my pictures and notice how there is almost no clearance between the body and the ball screw. In the picture demonstrating the clearance is a dime. The picture showing the width is a nickel.<br /><br />If you're pointy breasted or very long then it will be easier to place these on. Personally I don't really have a use for them, but they're not bad. I can see how the screws could possibly loosen up by themselves (they don't seem to be the most snug) but they didn't loosen while I had them on for 10 minutes.<br /><br />Worth checking out, anyway, if nipples are your thing."
4.0,"After reading reviews, I decided to go a size up. They fit well, but I wore it as a base layer at a 5k. The shirt kept riding up. After that, I started wearing a cami underneath, and the shirt stays put. Good shirts for the price."
4.0,"On the small side. Good construction, adjustable ear loops are well done."
4.0,"I followed advice to size up. My 4.5yo is about a 5T, tall and lean,  so I got Intermediate (6-8). It's a bit loose in the bottom and shoulders, but wearable. The material is very stretchy so I think she'd have been fine in the 4-6, but there is room to grow. I wish the material felt more like cotton (it's a stiffer elastic material), but she is happy."
4.0,I get so many compliments every time I wear this dress. I‚Äôve worn it twice and I‚Äôve notice the material is starting to become a little fuzzy so I don‚Äôt plan on getting too many wears out of it.
4.0,"Fit as expected, a little disappointed with the fabric, but the dress is cute and comfortable"
4.0,Quality hat but it doesn't fit down on my head.  I guess if you have a small head it would be great.
4.0,I like the sweater a lot!
4.0,The color is much less vivid in person
4.0,"Good product fit to s,ize"
4.0,"These undies provide great coverage. I'm 130 lbs with substantial booty, and the small was a little large on me. One wash/dry and they were pretty perfect."
4.0,"Fast Delevery, beuuty product"
4.0,"Bale broke, will be getting a jump ring to fix. Otherwise good product."
4.0,"Navy is very dark.  I had to hold it up to black to see the difference, but I like the color.  They were a little big on top even though I ordered according to the size chart.  I might try a smaller size next time to give me a little more compression.  The length was a little shorter than I expected based on the reviews I read, but I am tall (34-35 inch inseam on my jeans) and I think it will be fine for warmer weather or with boots.  They are not as tight around the ankle as other leggings I have and like, but ordering down a size next time might take care of that.  Soft fabric."
4.0,Looks good everything is straight.
4.0,Fits good. Don't slip.
4.0,Nice quality but way larger than expected. A large is really an X large.
4.0,Overall this swimsuit fits nice good material. There are no straps in the back so the side breast area is loose and may expose your breast. I will be sewing in straps to tie in the back to prevent a swim suit malfunction.
4.0,"They work very well, couldn't be happier for the price."
4.0,"This dress fabric is not a bad one, style is as expected.  It is worth the price.  However it is a bit too large for me, but it's true to the size 8 that I ordered even thought I am a 6, but since it's better to be a little too big than it would be to be too small."
4.0,Great fit and nice and cozy
4.0,"These are gorgeous! I adore them. I bought a Rhodochrosite for myself, and brecciated jasper for my boyfriend. They seem well made, and they're the perfect size. The packaging is fabulous! I'm thrilled I won't have to wrap my boyfriends because I hate wrapping gifts lol<br /><br />My only disappointment, and the reason behind the 4 stars instead of 5, is the little card these come with that explains the meaning of each stone. The particular stones I purchased where not listed. I had to Google and write down the meaning for my boyfriends, which is slightly annoying.<br /><br />Still, I just ordered 2 more in the other shapes for myself!"
4.0,"For reference, I'm 5'1"", a size 2 pant, 32d, size s/xs tops usually. Ordered a Medium based on reviews and still seems slightly small. But I'm going to keep it anyways... The colors are nice and bright, good stitching, and overall cute for the 4th of July."
4.0,"So, great quality and fit my average 4 1/2 year old just fine. But its May 2018 and they sent the cap with a 2017 charm on the tassle. Seems like an oversight and this is for a preschooler, so no sense returning just for that. All in all, pleased with this purchase!"
4.0,Good product- frames too thick for me
4.0,like this sweater & colour!!-price very nice & much better than Macy's !!
4.0,"does what it's supposed to. I kind of prefer the one side draw string of my old one with the sliding lock bead but this isn't that difficult to get your glasses into and out of.  Decent size and soft material. overall it does what I needed it to, it protects my shades and I can use it to wipe the lenses without scratching them."
4.0,"I got this for my sister, who is crossing this milestone in December. Although I haven't (obviously) given it to her just yet, I have checked it out and I think that for what this is priced at, it would be a good purchase.  This makes it a very affordable way to show someone special, that you are thinking of them. The packaging that it comes in, makes this very easy to gift wrap, which makes it very giftable. I think that my sister will be happy with this, and I think that you will be reasonably happy with your purchase, as long as your expectations match the cost of this üòä"
4.0,These came in like I expected them too. My boyfriend has the shorts just like them. I feel like I should have ordered up a size because they are thin and I really don't want them to rip. But he likes them so I'm happy.
4.0,Very nice shoes for the price!
4.0,"PRO:  The leather feels soft, the two pockets for bills are easily accessible, it has a zipper coin area, and the wallet fits into back pocket.  CON:  leather isn‚Äôt as visually attractive as I anticipated from the pictures, coin area is a little hard for a man‚Äôs fingers to access, but it isn‚Äôt impossible.  That would be easier for a boy.)"
4.0,"Nice bag, I will use as a briefcase. I am replacing my old one which has more compartments and easier access. Can't seem to find another one unless I'm willing to spend $800.00, and I'm not."
4.0,"They are not tooooo bug. Just a taad less snug than I like, that being said they have an ADORABLE slouchy look with some boots I just bought so they kind of work perfect. Good quality and they seem like they will help keep snow and cold out of my boots. So, Im pretty satisfied"
4.0,"Cute dress, very flattering.<br /><br />I have a larger bust and also had the odd issue of the top cutting across the breast line.  If I pull it down under my breasts it's girls, girls, girls!<br /><br />I was going to return, but I really did like the fit.  Asked a gal pal & she thought the top looked okay, so I wound up keeping it.<br /><br />If you want the top to fit properly under the bra line you seriously can't go over a C-cup, unless mine was just sewn oddly."
4.0,"like the thick souls , wish they breathed better"
4.0,No complaints. They work well in the tabi boots.
4.0,This shirt is cute and a very nice material. The only thing that slightly bothers me about it is that the tie and sleeves are not the same red. They are different shades. But it's comfortable and fits well.
4.0,nicee lne
4.0,It has decent texture and is decently thick and feels a little rubbery on the side. Good for the price however
4.0,"Nice length, it is a bit thin and clingy tho"
4.0,"I purchased these as gifts so far they are perfect for the occasion. I have not gifted them yet, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure how sturdy they are so I can only give the 4 stars"
4.0,"Great Hat, just a little small for my big head"
4.0,Looks just like the one from the show!
4.0,"Very comfortable, love the plush feel. The size fits and I am a size 9, I got the size 9-10. The colour is exactly as shown."
4.0,"Thick and Warm. Perfect for the damp London weather.<br /><br />Perfect length.<br /><br />I am 5‚Äô6, 32c bra and usually wear small tops<br /><br />One star short of perfectness because it‚Äôs fading after one wash and I can see piling staring."
4.0,"Somewhat thinner than I thought,  but will work in 60 degree to 50 degree with blanket"
4.0,Very pretty.  Used the alternative size chart and these pants were still too small.  Gave them away - smaller size person likes them a lot.
4.0,Doll is not as shown in picture<br />My daughter chose this bag cause of cute doll but it‚Äôs not like that
4.0,"I ordered this for my working Security Dog. The Rings once bent outward, do not return to shape<br />easily, so I would say cheap metal.  The badge holder looks ""professional grade"" from a distance but up close<br />it's imitation leather. It does hold a badge very nicely and tight, no sloppiness there.  I attached it to an Icefang Tactical Harness D-ring, without issue.  If the rings don't hold up well I'll replace them, I added scotchguard to the imitation leather to make it waterproof.  Overall? A good device on a budget but if professional grade you need, this just isn't it."
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute swimsuit! Only thing is that the zipper is in the back so it‚Äôs a little annoying to put on.
4.0,I didn't find many options for distressed jeans for toddlers. This is pretty good in terms of style and quality. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it fits very loose around the thighs.
4.0,"I ordered my normal size in this tank top, I didn't expect it to be tight. But that's not a problem for me. It's super cute and looks awesome with a sweater. Also it looks nice on for going out, sexy but not revealing in the chest area. The material is very breathable and I could easily wear this in the summer time! Happy with my purchase (:"
4.0,"looks great, chain is of great quality. really creates an interesting dynamic to a clothing ensemble. Would definitely recommend but be careful it breaks. But it is a stronger chain then almost all the others I have tried, and for less then three dollars its a great piece. Can look great with actual clothes, not just bikinis and stuff. I haven't tried it with a dress yet but with pants and a softer flair peplum it looks great."
4.0,Love this product. Good value for the money
4.0,"The bag is really cute and fits my laptop perfectly.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the loop on the long strap broke the 2nd day I had the bag."
4.0,Very cute. Not a bright white like I was expecting though.  Sort of a grey tinted to it.
4.0,Does not close too good unless you press hard on the snap but it is a cute purse.
4.0,The hat has elastic to allow size control. Wetting the head band generates cooling via evaporation. It works well for the hot sun!
4.0,"Unique design, loved in blue color. Size is pretty good."
4.0,Really cute top.  I usually wear a large and ordered up one size.
4.0,"Love it! Runs a little large but it's comfy, good material and very flattering. Will be buying in more colors!"
4.0,"Watch is really stunning and unusual. Unfortunately, I am a small woman with a small wrist and this watch is just too big on me. (I wear kids' gloves.)I had hoped its elastic band would work to my advantage. But there's more elastic than I can stretch out. I'm going to try to disassemble the watch and refeed the components on my own band... It really is so  pretty."
4.0,Very nice necklaces.  Got early than expected.
4.0,"I have been looking for bathing suits online and in store for a few months now, with no luck! Our trip is next week so I ordered two before this one and the sizing was completely off I had to send them back. After reading reviews and looking at almost everyone's picture and stats I decided to go on and order this one in the size that matched with my clothing size (XXL) I normally wear a medium or large in shirts and dresses so that seemed big, but I stuck with the reviews. I am 5'5&#34; - 152 pounds - and a 36C (sometimes D depending on where from) - and I have a big butt and thighs, smaller in my waist area. This bathing suit fits almost perfectly! The top is maybe a tiny bit big on my breasts but not noticeable or bothersome. I knew I couldn't go any smaller in the suit because my Butt and thighs normally need a larger size than the top. The bottoms fit great besides being a smidge right around my thighs in the legs holes. Again, not uncomfortably tight and still love the suit. The waist is a tiny bit big but I figured that considering my waist is smaller than my bottom area. Overall I would recommend this suit again!!"
4.0,"My own personal likeness to this shoe, but sole is very flat footed,"
4.0,"Cute and unique dress. The material is a bit thick so may not be ideal for a hot summer day or a walk in the park. However it's perfect for a dinner or a show at the theatre. I especially love the collars. It is a bit stretchy, so there is plenty of room to move"
4.0,Not exactly the color I thought. Was hoping for a more vibrant color but overall the boots are nice and I would purchase again from this seller.
4.0,"Scarf is super soft, good length and vibrant colors. It's a nice addition to the collection I have. I really like how the house crest is split comes together on the opposite ends of the scarf."
4.0,Perfect for plunging neck line
4.0,I have big hands but these are too big for me.  Should have gotten a much smaller size.  But they are heavy duty.
4.0,Get the black especially if it's for toddlers. The white ones are hard to clean even if it just dust from their own shoes.
4.0,The pajamas are very comfortable and nice to lodge in during the day.<br />The fit is true to size.
4.0,"This is my second dress from Miusol. Both are well made and flattering. The quality here is great, especially for the price! My one complaint is that the sash is attached to the dress so that it can only tie in the back. I would have preferred a separate sash so I could tie it to the side or in front or swaps it out for a different belt entirely. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great party dress."
4.0,They slip more than other headbands that I have purchased
4.0,Big fan of the low rise jean. I have an extremely short waist and find high rise jeans impossible to wear as they always fold over. Mid rise jeans always feel like they‚Äôre falling off.  These jeans are great. Super stretchy and comfortable!
4.0,Love this backpack BUT when I removed packaging (plastic bag) it smelled so badly I had to stuff dryer sheets in all compartments to mitigate the odor. I had to wait 7 days until the backpack was aired out and free of odor.  I'd order another but really hesitate  to do so because of this experience.
4.0,Nice fit. I‚Äôm long bodied and it was a bit short. But should fit the norm.
4.0,"Great bundle, but lower quality jewelry. Excellent price though"
4.0,"I needed a towel I could wear after showering. This one is soft and wraps well. It's a bit big, so maybe get a size down. Soft, but thin so if you're looking for a towel-type cloth, make sure you read the description!"
4.0,It was really nice but the veil wasn't long enough
4.0,"Is a pretty dress , I put 4 star because the color is not exactly like in picture, it‚Äôs a little bit blue dark and the top is not white is like clear ivory but still nice. I expected fit at knee but like in the picture that I posted  is a little bit short maybe because my daughter is 5f 6 inches tall. I got it before that I expected and very happy with the product."
4.0,"These tank bodysuits are absolutely adorable! My daughter looks super-cute in them, but they are fairly thin fabric, to the point of being somewhat see-through. She runs warm, so this was not a problem for us during this hot summer, just something to be aware of. This color is a mint green, not blue."
4.0,Cute dress. A little tight in the chest if you‚Äôre large chested. Lightweight material perfect for summer.
4.0,sunglasses
4.0,"I purchased the 5T for my 6yr old. She's 3ft 1in and between 35-40lbs.<br /><br />The bodysuit fit well even with a t-shirt and leggings underneath. She still had plenty of room to move and it wasn't overly baggy. I like that the hood is built into the bodysuit with it's own zipper for a seamless affect once zipped.<br /><br />My only problem was the headpiece/mask. It was made badly. The eyes were stitched too close together and too far up. The eyes landing on her forehead. It also fit tightly with little give,  which made it hard to breathe if kept on for long. Also take note for girls with thick curly hair you may want to cornrow/braid the hair down for a better fit. That's what I did to make sure it wasn't her hair causing the issues. Even after that it was clear the mask was the problem. She wore it long enough to get a picture.<br /><br />Overall she liked the costume just not the mask."
4.0,Not bad. Material was a bit cheap but it absolutely served its purpose.
4.0,"Earrings arrived on time. They were to complete a Spanish dancer costume look, they are beautiful picture does not due justice to the sparkle of black stones and intricate details of the dangle. Can be easily worn with any cocktail dress."
4.0,Iighter weight than expected
4.0,I like it Thank You PowerDealz
4.0,It truly is a nice outfit but looked very frumpy when I tried it. Will sadly have to return. I'm sure it will look lovely on someone else.  I'm not the easiest to fit so I can't blame the outfit for that.
4.0,My wife has been having some  back trouble and these compressinon shirts are helping  her to take much less of her medication  thanks
4.0,"Beautiful watch, sturdy and hefty material, seems like a solid build.  All the dials and buttons work well and resizing the band is fairly easy as long as you're careful. The only knock on it is that I can't seem to reset the second hand. It was already active when I opened the package and I want to calibrate it, but can't seem to reset the second hand. Either way, it's beautiful and worth every penny.<br /><br />There's only two things wrong with this watch:<br />1. The calendar goes to 39 due to a design flaw. No big deal, reset and carry on once a month.<br /><br />2. You can not set the second hand. Other than waiting for 40 hours without wearing it to let it die, I haven't found a way to fix it.<br /><br />Still the best looking watch I've ever had, easy to adjust the band, and runs like a dream. I've not had a problem with it stopping at all."
4.0,I return this dress I didn‚Äôt like the material  didn‚Äôt fit right in the chest area I‚Äôm at 36D I do not recommend
4.0,"that it needs to be removed before washing dishes or showering, I'm afraid with all the bending on the ring it will break"
4.0,these cargo shorts are a great summer weight along with being cotton the only suggestion is to make them with a separate cell phone pocket.
4.0,"I really liked this dress.  It was long enough, I'm 5'5. I ordered the 2x and it fit just how I wanted. The material is kind clingy, so I suggest wearing a body shaper underneath the dress."
4.0,Nice and sturdy. Came with extra battery also.  Worth the price.
4.0,I only got 29 rings and 1 single ball but other then the 1 missing ring I love all the different colors
4.0,"They're really cute, but not exactly what I was looking for, I'll give them as a gift instead and look for something else for myself. I'd prefer an adjustable chain instead of the bangle, I have very small wrists and these are a little big on me. The packaging was very pretty and shipping was fast though, so 4 stars for that."
4.0,They work fine and good for the price
4.0,The watch came on time.. Only thing I didn't like was the face that it said Bling on it in the inside of
4.0,Nice easy dress!
4.0,"I love this shirt. Am ordering 3 more colors. It's very comfortable, and fits great. It's just not worthy of 5 stars as far as quality, ( stitching, petty stuff). Things other people may not even notice.<br />But, I trust this brand.  ‚ò∫"
4.0,"Cute soft, very functional and a favorite for my daughter!"
4.0,"Nice shirt but runs small.  At least with our experience, we needed a size larger."
4.0,"I like the material,nice and soft."
4.0,"I really like the soft leather of these gloves.  They do a good job of keeping my hands warm in average cold temperatures.  The touchscreen function of the gloves are a hit and miss.  I have to get it at the right angle to work.  The packaging was amazing, and very professional looking.  Overall, a good pair of gloves that I'd recommend."
4.0,"I haven't heard anything bad form the giftee, will edit if I hear anything. She likes them so far."
4.0,Got this for a trip to help stay out the sun it was a little flimsy but got the job done.
4.0,"I loved the looks of the jewelry and the quality seems great, They just didn‚Äôt match up with my tunnels quite right"
4.0,Bonita camiseta
4.0,A bit big to carry as a purse but works good as an overnight bag...or a carryone. I can put my purse inside of it.
4.0,"These are great, but slippery if wet."
4.0,The chain is a little flimsy and cheap looking but the pendant is adorable. I think it's a great value for the cost and recommend it.
4.0,I ordered this (the polka dot) and a blue one... both fit very nicely.  The material is comfortable and flowing.  It makes me feel pretty!  :)  My mother and my daughter both are going to purchase a couple for themselves.  WOnderful buy for the price.  Thank you!
4.0,Love these socks. Fits comfortly and great for 12 hour work days.
4.0,Perfecto el tama√±o
4.0,"The dress is cut smaller than regular size, but it is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"This tank fits a little large. I usually wear a medium (5'7"" 34D), but went up to a large for a looser fit. I probably should have stuck with the medium. The material is thicker than workout tops I am used to, but I don't seem to get too hot while wearing it."
4.0,Nice but too large for a two year old otherwise fine
4.0,Looks very good in my ears!!
4.0,This bag seems to be good quality. I ended up returning it because it measures larger than 62&#34; linear standard for the airlines' oversize baggage threshold. We would have had to pay the oversize luggage fee if we used it. We decided to get the 25&#34; bags instead and we shall see how they fair after a honeymoon to Alaska.
4.0,"Good wig, very soft, but fairly thin and not the best construction I have ever seen. Curls not as prominent as shown in pictures, more like waves. Shipping was fast but FedEx got confused."
4.0,"I love this dress, the neckline is odd but I used a safety pin to pull down the center and it fixed everything right up.  Amazing quality for the price."
4.0,"It's super cute and my daughter loves it, but it was smaller than I expected for a size 7. The Shoulder strap ripped from the body of the jumpsuit. I'd recommend purchasing one size bigger than the child's regular size."
4.0,"So the costume its self was fine but the leg wraps are a little weird but its fine its usable, i would give it 5 stars but i dislike the leg wraps."
4.0,You better hand wash these and hang dry.<br />They get linted up & keeps it on!!!
4.0,I loved the anklet but the necklace is very small almost childlike.
4.0,"Love it , fits really well"
4.0,Definitely cute hats and perfect for fall time. Only wish they were a little bigger. I bought them for my 3 month old and they were tight. So I only got to wear them once or twice. Such a shame because I would have loved to wear all of the colors.
4.0,Cute makes everything look orange very unique not bad at all
4.0,Like it but part of the material came off
4.0,I bought clean. Normally wear a medium. The shoulders fit me in xl. I understand some of the comments about not fitting like the model. Try tucking some fabric under the waist band for less of a pooch.
4.0,"I like the sunglasses, they look good."
4.0,I bought these to wear to the beach. They seem to be holding up with frequent exposure to salt water. I'll update if they start to rust.
4.0,Fit as expected. I am not sure if the tap plate is normal for this kind of shoe ‚Äî I am used to them sticking out more so that they make a good tap sound ‚Äî the front bottom plate seems a hair short and is somewhat flush with the sole.
4.0,Very cute.  Already received compliments.  Wish they were a little larger in the calf and a little more narrow in the ankle thouhg.
4.0,This is a super cute sports bra it does run a little small but it is comfortable and I love it
4.0,silver came off.
4.0,"I can‚Äôt rate this particular one, because I purchased the original black ones. Which I still use today on a regular basis.<br />I keep in the car to have handy when I go grocery shopping or my favorite drives to country fruit stands and meat markets.<br />It keeps my cold items cold, and I can safely get ice cream home before a melted mess. I only wish they were made tall enough to be able to close he lid with a gallon of milk sitting upright. I will hold off for now on purchasing this one, due to price, and the review from someone that stated wasn‚Äôt as thick as originals. I do like that they collapse, fold down."
4.0,A bit long for 5‚Äô3‚Äù but soft on skin
4.0,"I really like these suitcases! They are just what I was looking for: hard cover with a front pocket for easy access. I no longer worry about whether or not my over stuffed luggage will need to be checked. The only reason I give this a 4/5 is because while the front pockets are extremely useful they are pretty much for one layer of items only; for example if I put my laptop in it, I cannot also put a kindle or book, but I could fit some phone chargers or something like that. Other than that, I love it. The locks are great and the bright Orange will ensure I can find it on the carousel. Very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"This is one of my favorite frame by Tantino. Their sunglasses is very affordable so I do like getting their sunglasses. I wasn‚Äôt sure if oversized square wayfarer retro would fit me personally but it does. I feel like I switch up my style and rocking this wayfarer retro frame. I have got a lot of compliments on these glasses so I am keeping this frame all to myself. There is no way I will be sharing this frame with anyone in my family or my friend.  It is a plastic frame and lens but they do feel durable. The lens itself is non-polarized but does have 100% protection against UVA/UVB rays. I only have one complaint about the glasses, which is the gloss. I knock off one star for this reason. It is glossy so there would be a ton of fingerprints and mark all over the glasses. I had to keep wiping my glasses every time I put it on. That would be my only issues so other than that, I like the sunglasses and already been telling people where to find them. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Fabric was just ok. After reading about the dark color, I‚Äôm a little concerned about it bleeding on my underwear."
4.0,"I won't lie, I bought this set just for the trees. But all are very cute and feminine. The trees are my favorite, very bright and detailed, but the other two pair are also pretty. I will wear all of them. Worth the buy."
4.0,I bought the white in a large because of the color and the black in a medium. The medium actually fit better. It was a bit roomier in the bust area and more fitted in the midriff. I returned the white L and kept black M. Love the top.
4.0,The back detail is beautifully done!!  Thanks!!
4.0,Pretty but not a true red
4.0,"Just purchased this watch for half the price on Amazon. Great feel, most comfortable strap and so far keeping accurate time. Nice orange and black watch a real eye catcher. Wife likes it so that seals the deal."
4.0,This was my first time purchasing any jewelry type items online. My fiance loved the gift. My only gripe with it is that the charm moves around a lot unless you cinch it really tight.<br /><br />The crystal was beautiful. The necklace seems durable. Also it looks great on my girl. Just wish it didn't slide so easy.
4.0,I am well pleased with the look of these earings altho they were a little bigger than I thought but over all I like them
4.0,Larger then expected but my daughter still loves them.  We'll have to punch a hole to make them fit her.
4.0,They are a bit big for my face but I like it that way. Really cute!!
4.0,Nice tshirt for the pric . Fits well. I am 6'2&#34; and weigh 210. The compression is perfect with a size large.
4.0,I gave this to a friend and I saw her wore it and it looked nice on her slender neck.
4.0,They fall out easily and get lost I would recommend the metal ones
4.0,Beautiful dress!  I almost kept it but the lining under the lace was too loose and it was too bunched up in places and noticable.
4.0,I liked it very much. I gave it as two gifts and kept one for myself.
4.0,"I love the necklace and the tunic, but the tunic was much too small.  I gave the tunic to a friend and she loves it."
4.0,"Ordered a size L. It was somewhat tight around my chest. I'm a size 38B. I enjoy how it compliments my waist/curves. I love the front of the dress, it has little buttons."
4.0,"This dress is super comfy! Fits true to size and the only reason I rated it with 4 stars was because it is a little see through, but with some leggings and the right things underneath you are good to go!"
4.0,"Needed something to break up a solid colored dress,  and I was not disappointed. I wear it frequently!<br /> The only thing I would change about it,  is making one layer shorter than the other. Both seem to be the same length."
4.0,Love the colors!  The non skid on the bottom works great. Only downside is how tight they are on my normal-sized 18 month old‚Äôs legs/ankle. They leave deep impression marks.
4.0,Nice fit came past my knees...gloves are good to but I‚Äôm pretty small 5‚Äù5 100lbs..
4.0,"Didn't receive until a month later (got refund) was told to keep item.  Kids love it, runs a little small but worth the price just order one size larger.."
4.0,My son lived these. Very roomy and comfy.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 122 pounds and normally wear a medium. Based on the reviews of this dress being so boxy, I ordered a size small. It would look just a touch better if it were brought in just a little, but overall, I‚Äôm freaking adorable in this thing. Also, wear a slip since it‚Äôs see-through and get used to feeling like a T Rex with the sleeves (mobility is slightly limited due to the stretch, but you‚Äôll get used to it)."
4.0,Bottoms a little big. But overall happy with them.
4.0,"If you like long earrings, you'll love these.  On me, they come all the way down to the top of my shoulders.  They are very colorful.  Good value for the money."
4.0,Very cute. Thin material though.
4.0,"These tank tops are so cute (looks same as the picture) and the quality is awesome. After washing a few times, still doesn't feel worn out or saggy. I love thay all Pureborn Baby clothes have tags outside. Would purchase from this brand again."
4.0,Decently sized belt. I'm size 32 so I bought a 34-36 size. I fit in the exact middle hole so there's room for both ways! However this belt is very squeaky. Hopefully it'll tone down the more I wear it
4.0,"It even talks in English, it has a large area where I can sterilize my phone üì± using UV light. I can use it to disinfect my keys ,toothbrush etc .I love it !"
4.0,"I got this for my daughter.  It looks really cute on her. The skirt part of the dress is really stiff, but overall it looks cute."
4.0,"I ordered and XL and was sent a 3XL...it was way too big, but I needed it to dress with coworkers. It's very thin and probably won't last long, but only wearing it once a year here and there it should be OK. I didn't dare zip it. Wasn't sure if it would break."
4.0,"It's a great dress, and I bought them in three colors. I kept solid ones, however that dress I'm returning. Color print is very different from what on a website, it's more dull, more weathered orange/ brown with dust blue, it has some gold thread outlines on flowers.  However as I'm trying to take a picture colors comes out much brighter then dress is in reality. Bottom line colors are nov bright but more dull."
4.0,"Cute designs and adjustable ear pieces. If I need to be wearing a mask I might as well be styling while doing it.<br />Would like to have a nose clip piece, but for this price I can do without."
4.0,I like these they are small and fit well.
4.0,Hat was a little small for my head. My grandson wears it & loves it
4.0,"Loved this when it came in however, after a couple weeks of wear it started to peel.  I emailed 2 times about this with no reply. I do not recommend."
4.0,Make teeing off soooooo much nicer when the ground if frozen.  Just have to find it after you hit the ball
4.0,Very cute but sent a size 5 toddler when I ordered a size 5 big kids!?
4.0,Bought it for my lil sister as a small graduataion gift... she loved it !!
4.0,"Feels good against the skin. We've been having temps in the below zero ranges, this is warm and cozy, perfect for lounging.. I do have a Warning: wash it a few times before wearing it. Otherwise you'll have pink lint from the underside fabric ALL OVER your house."
4.0,Cute dress. The material feels like cotton with spandex . Nice thickness so that it is not see through. If you are basicly evenly proportioned (chest and hips) this dress will work for you. The material does not have as much stretch as a knit material. Purchased for a typical size 8 (bought a large). Will wear with a thin black belt to help cinch the waist.
4.0,The butt part was a litte small
4.0,I like the style and how easy it is to put on. They are securely on for the day and easy to take off.
4.0,"Great bag and price - very stylish.  The only complaint is that the shoe compartment lining is unattached to the rest of the bag, so pulls out when I pull my shoes out, and can make it difficult to put shoes back in if stuff is already in the main compartment."
4.0,"I guess I didn't realize how small it was going to be, but they are very pretty and small! And they don't come with clips attached so I have to find some."
4.0,I like this Jacket and the size is perfect.
4.0,Love that you can wear this sweater with either side facing front. Highly recommend but it does run big.
4.0,I love these bracelets!  Very cute and I love the ability to add essential oils to the three lava beads.  I did have one of the bracelet elastics break.  I'm not sure if it was due to the essential oil or what but I can easily restring them.
4.0,"Super cute and quality is good, however, in the picture, the girls top was a V-neck, but when received, it was a crew neck.  Preferred the V-neck, but not worth the time to return."
4.0,"It would have been a perfect 10, but it does not hold in the closed ""position"", it releases a bit due to pressure!<br />Wish it locks better! Thanks"
4.0,Gorgeous belt. A little heavy for those delicate femine looks but greart for the everyday casual look.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ed4c4d08e47590c4f873d4df38a9932]] Material/color: it‚Äôs a sublimation process so the printing process is different, and if you know sublimation - you know it‚Äôs stretchy. But, with the stretchy you do go that white rubbing lines appearing. Kinda like the socks lines around the ankle part going vertically, it‚Äôs like that so if it‚Äôs tight you do lose a bit of coloring since the white lines in the fabric makes the color seem lighter since your print is now being stretched to show those white lines.... (lol üòùü§ì I‚Äôm high but I just got hell descriptive-  but real talk üòÅ)<br /><br />Fit:<br />Well, I‚Äôm a thick girl 5‚Äô8‚Äù like 190 lbs, 38C so Large fits me snug, but I like my clothes tight. I wouldn‚Äôt zip it up or else it doesn‚Äôt look as rich in color since I‚Äôm stretching it a bit. For me - the XL would be best but I like it as is.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not thick material, not super light ... it‚Äôs ... lightweight üôÉ but not thin."
4.0,"I loved the look. I am a little worried about the magnetic clasp. So far so good, but I haven't worn it for a long length of time."
4.0,"I got these for my husband who cannot see green or red.  They did make things brighter or seem to 'stand out' more but he still couldn't see green or red.  I rated these a 4 because it's not the glasses fault, they do work for some but can't work for everyone, but they are very good quality glasses.  I also rated them a 4 because as soon as I sent the email informing the company they didn't work they promptly sent me a shipping label to return them for free and they put my refund check in the mail.  Excellent customer service!  Side note: we've also tried Enchroma glasses and they didn't work either but we did do a comparison and they are very similar quality and performance."
4.0,"I really like the design of this wallet; not only is it beautiful to look at but also functional with all the pockets inside to hold money, cards, and a spot for your cellphone. I have an iPhone XS and it fits perfectly. Would but again."
4.0,"This bracelet is very nice.  A little smaller than I expected and I'm not sure if it was worth the price (I guess it was so expensive because it had a lot of stones...?).  The bracelet fits my wrist perfectly, as I have tiny wrists, that's hard to find.  The clasp was weird, but I figured it out.  I think it was stuck the first time I tried to unlatch it...?  The stones are beautiful and look so nice with my other Mystic Topaz jewelry."
4.0,Loved the skirt and the bells at the end of the string that make a nice clinking sound. Afraid to wash as the golden print designs may go away.
4.0,"Very cute! Nice quality, does not look cheap. Large enough to be noticeable but small enough to not be heavy or gaudy.<br /><br />Only disappointment is the spoke bent after wearing it at night and sleeping on that side. It was able to be bent back but now im worried it has weakened and the spoke might break off!"
4.0,"I ordered this to wear to my husband's holiday party. It's a nice shirt, but I ordered a size up and it still wasn't as roomy as I wanted it to be, and it didn't really go off the shoulder as much as it created a boat neckline. Still very cute."
4.0,I very much love the look and feel of this jacket but it runs very small.  I would recommend going at least one size up.  This large feels like a medium.
4.0,"I use these for being lazy on the couch, my husband uses them for shaving his neck. They‚Äôre pretty heavy but I‚Äôm not wearing them out and about so it‚Äôs not too bad. Would buy as a gift"
4.0,Great looking but clip comfort needs improvement; suggest a larger padded clip. Left painful indent on the front of my ear.
4.0,love the pockets
4.0,So far I have not used this bag.  The rating is based on looks and possible usage I will have at a later date.  I like the locking zipped areas as a safety feature and well as the RFID protection of passport and credit cards.<br /><br />Hoping it meets all my requirements when I do use this bag.
4.0,Material was a bit thinner than their usual stuff and a little stretch. Overall a fun pair of pants.
4.0,Love this but after wearing it only twice the zipper broke
4.0,These shoes are so cute! My daughter loves them. Unfortunately one of the shoes doesn't light up and they took so long to ship.
4.0,I really love this dress have black and dark red love them only wish it fit me right cant blam the dress though. I'm get there though. Love the dress.
4.0,Fabric is really nice. Beautiful color and fit as expected. My daughter loves the shirt.
4.0,"Excellent.  Waterproof and very functional.  One drawback is the mesh lining.  As putting on the coat the mesh gets displaced to the outside of the sleeve, if not adjusting correctly.  I would still buy again, but if it had better lining, it would be a 5 star rating."
4.0,"A simple, stylish mousepad - great price, seems like it will keep getting the job done for a while."
4.0,"Fit exactly like I expected, it is a little thinnger than I thought it would be, but I am still happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Some of the charms are done well. I was impressed with the Mickey and Minnie as many of those charms are horrible. The engraved hearts are also done well. You can read each one easily. Some of these charms are just too small and would just disappear in your locket with the other charms. Only a couple of duplicates. Some of the charms the enamel wasn‚Äôt done well. Some are hard to tell what they are. If there had been more in there I would use I would have kept them considering the price. Most were not what I was looking for. Thank you Amazon for free returns on this product!
4.0,The pants are short.  In the picture they look like long bottoms but they are more like capries.  However they are supper soft and comfy.
4.0,"I bought this to wear underneath a sheer dress and its basically perfect.  I am 5'8&#34; and 155 lbs, I ordered a size Large, it fits snugly as I wanted it to.  I do not like the fact that it is ribbed, but otherwise no complaints."
4.0,"Look great in it, lots of compliments"
4.0,Cute shirt; my granddaughter loves it.
4.0,Just the perfect size to wear to work.  Attractive & light-weight.  I wear these when I wear my hair up.
4.0,Love it. Only wish it had a zipper. Put another bag inside with zipper.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute with sturdy in the clasps
4.0,"This necklace is just outstandingly beautiful.. perfect for a girl of any age.. from young to old. just a wow! The setting and color are so pretty. It comes with a little blue pouch and a jewelry card, I can tell the seller is working hard to earn their business."
4.0,"This is a great product, especially for it's asking price. I bought them for my boyfriend and he and I both love them. He seemed satisfied with them too, which of course makes me happy."
4.0,A bit heavy and loose but it good
4.0,"Perfect color and condition. But it is a bit large. Like length wise. Not size wise. It fit perfectly but just torso wise, it ran long."
4.0,They have that great backing
4.0,"I usually wear a small, but bought a medium due to the reviews on here about how short the dress is. The medium is the perfect length, but because I am smaller in the chest area the dress is a little too big. All in all the quality of this dress is great and it's is very cute."
4.0,"Would have given a 5 but it is still early going to Cali in May will update after hello everyone first my measurements I'm 6'2 290lbs with a dad stomach lol. I purchased a 2XL at first because everyone said it will fit when I  was reading review because of my height and weight, and I didn't want to believe them because people don't tell the turth all the time. The 2XL will fit someone that is tall and slim perfectly. But being 6'2  with some weight you will  need a bigger size. I reordered it but in a 4XL and it fits great, if you buy this and you are 6'2 not lie to herself and get the right size which is 3XL to 4XL"
4.0,Love the material and the coat is very stylish though it only has two buttons so doesn‚Äôt cover up very high. I like the color as well; kind of a burnt tan.
4.0,"Even though I had to pay a seamstress to shorten the inseam on all of these because my husband wears a 30‚Äù length in pants, it was worth it.  The pants are nice lightweight.  The pockets are convenient and the material is appropriate for his line of work."
4.0,It looks real natural Jade for a great price. I have small wrist and fit perfectly fine.
4.0,Nice death note pendant but the chain broke on the first day.
4.0,"So far it has held the oil scent that I chose to use, but I haven't had it that long."
4.0,"Needed to fix one of the ribbons but with a small safety pin, it looked great. Got a ton of complements. Matched my tux well."
4.0,"Got these because I have one foot that is swollen, although nominally a size 12 shoe.  Sock was a little big for my other foot, but after a wash and dry, fit is fine on both feet.  Seems well made, but only time will tell how rugged they are.  Hence, 4 stars instead of 5.."
4.0,"Light weight and easy to put on , I like shoes that are easy to put on , these seem to be doing the job."
4.0,It looks nice but it's just to big that's it.
4.0,They‚Äôre beautiful. I haven‚Äôt tried them on yet but they‚Äôre looking sooo pretty.
4.0,They were a gift but I was told they fit fine.
4.0,"It was accurately described, fairly priced, and rapidly received...All in all, a perfect transaction"
4.0,"I'm 5'8, and it's a little short but will be nice for just an easy dress to throw on and makes a nice casual look"
4.0,"I like the fact that you can really get this tight and it will NOT pinch.<br />After a couple of weeks this elastic is strong. I'm a 250 lb., active, not huge, but chubby and the only thing I don't like is the thinness of the buckle but you snap it in and BOOM, that's it , it stays.<br />I will be buying another one of these, or, one that is maybe ‚Öõ "" narrower and hope the elastine is as good a quality.<br />Remember if you order this to double check your pants belt loops, the width of the plastic buckle is slightly wider than the belt , it fits my size 40"" Levis so that ought to help.<br />This is a good belt to wear the hell out of!"
4.0,"Great color, softness, and sizing. will work perfectly. Only 4 stars because it‚Äôs not as opaque as advertised."
4.0,As described.  Looks great on a Navy Sportcoat
4.0,"The shirt was nice and the material was good, but the sleeves were too tight. I would recommend getting one size bigger than what you normally get."
4.0,More pink/magenta than a truepurple. They fit perfectly and do have a nice wet look. They will work for my costume.
4.0,These are small and dainty.  Love them.
4.0,perfect size for a child.  Not a teen or adult.  Very very tiny.  But great quality.
4.0,It feels nice on the skin.  But I'm short so it's long on me.  Even when I wear heels
4.0,Cute and flexible. Leaves are super trendy. The roses look a little weird for my style but probably great for someone else.
4.0,wear it all the time  it is at least visible  does not get lost on finger
4.0,The fabric is soft and flows very nice. Comfortable and stylish!<br />Compliments the whole day!<br />And it was a great value.
4.0,No more hat hair!!! I have thick hair and when I wear hats without the ponytail hole I either have to wear my hair down and suffer with hat hair or the hat doesn't cover my ears because of the ponytail. This hat is great. The hole for the ponytail or bun easy to pull your hair through. I have thick curly hair and I haven't had any issues with getting my hair through the hole.
4.0,"Good quality, just way to long for me"
4.0,I got a bigger size because I think sizing is according to Japan‚Äôs sizing so for a curvy Polynesian woman I had to size up a lot. Bottoms ended up not fitting but I didn‚Äôt mind that. Still came out great and quality of the shirt is durable
4.0,"Fits great and is soft. Bled a little when washing, but overall I like it!"
4.0,"works well, almost too well. it is somewhat difficult to slide the cards out. However, my husband uses it everyday."
4.0,"These are cute. Run a bit small, had to go up a size. 135 lbs / 5‚Äô7‚Äù‚Ä¶returned small & got a medium. Also runs a little short."
4.0,"Fit nice, is mostly waterproof aside from the spaces where the tongue of the shoe and laces are. I recommend the normal version for that and not the furless laced one. Keeps my feet warm if I wear two pairs of socks (very cold at this time). It's not too bad with just one pair either. Anti-slip (won't work on ice), wish it had a hard bottom and not flexible."
4.0,"I'm 5'11&#34;, I normally wear a 10/12, I ordered the 10 and it was perfect. This is an amazing dress."
4.0,Good quality. Only thing is one of the buttons comes undone every so often
4.0,"Bought this to go over a Titan jacket, which is size large. The XL jersey is a bit snug for this. Needed a bit of help to get it on, but otherwise it was okay; got it off easily enough. Once on, it didn't hinder any movement, or anything. It fits okay without the Titan, too. If you're only going to wear over armor, I would go up another size. Otherwise, this will do just fine. Maybe I'll get better at getting the jersey over the back of the Titan, too. Oh, and shipping was fast."
4.0,very nice but runs a little small
4.0,This dress is gorgeous and perfect for my daughter's First Holy Communion. She wanted a poofy dress and I wanted formal so this fit the bill. The lace and bead work is really nice. My only complaint it is was strangely wide. Now that being said my daughter is tall and thin. We ordered the size 9 and it fit well enough. She is 51in tall and about 62 lbs.
4.0,Super Cute Great Buy
4.0,"They fit well, used it for halloween. However, after the 1st wash the material got numerous fuz balls around and i will probably not wear them again."
4.0,Not very clear in the description that it is a slim fit. The only indication I could find was one of the pics had a size chart. Had to return and get next size up.
4.0,All 3 tanks are super cute.
4.0,A little tight in the arms but they will loosen. Looks Great.
4.0,I bought this to tie in my chemo scarf and jacket I am wearing to a wedding. The chain isn't as gold as the picture shows but more of a brass color which is what I'd expect on a $20 necklace. The stones are pretty. I can clasp it at varying lengths which is nice. I mix and match costume and real jewelry and will enjoy wearing this necklace. The loss of one star is based on how it was shipped. There was no gift bag. The necklace was in a small jewelry plastic bag then shipped in a large not-very-padded white envelope. I'm surprised it wasn't damaged.
4.0,Cute! Hat fits my big head! Score!
4.0,"This is really cute, I like the look and I like the option to have a chin strap if I‚Äôm using it while boating or in the wind. It‚Äôs lightweight and while I like that it can fold for travel, I am concerned that it came folded into fourths and the creases in it seem very difficult to get out, and wearing the hat with the creases will be a bit dorky. Hopefully I can get them out by washing it or ironing the creases? Otherwise a good value for sure."
4.0,"It's okay. It has a grainy texture but could easily get dirty. It's kind of stiff, but probably because it's a little thick. The color/design could get easily faded specially if your arm usually rests on the table while working on a computer daily."
4.0,True to size. Came with belt. Love to design. Wish the fabric was a little thicker
4.0,Very comfortable just wish the fly was really for easy bathroom trips.
4.0,this is a great bag. fits my planner nicely and all my junk. would buy again.
4.0,"The bottom part does not work for me, I don‚Äôt like the shape and it doesn‚Äôt feel confortable. The design is cute and looks just like the picture."
4.0,These gloves are awesome. Used for a week so far. I use them for box handling inside a warehouse. Awesome grip! Only complaint is that they smell incredibly bad. Smell worse than 10 homeless peoples feet in 5x5 room! But great grip!!
4.0,I bought these to protect my arms when I do yard  work.  I liked these sleeves except the material was kinda rough. They felt heavy on my arms.<br />They did protect really well.  I will use them in he fall. In the meantime I will look for a cooler pair.
4.0,I really like the bracelet. It is very pretty and I know my grandchildren will love them. I couldn't believe the price on them.
4.0,"It‚Äôs definitely a lot more ‚Äúminty‚Äù green, then what is pictured. It doesn‚Äôt have a tag, so honestly I don‚Äôt know what the front or back is. I like the quality of it, it‚Äôs nice."
4.0,"Cheap feeling for daily wear, but made a great costume piece. You get what you pay for."
4.0,"So I originally bought the 7.5 inch bracelet because my wrist is apparently approximately that size after measuring with a piece of string and a ruler. When I got the bracelet, the 7.5 inch one was pretty tight on my wrist, and after awhile I felt like it was cutting off circulation because my hand and wrist were starting to get numbish/cold. It would leave some pretty red indents in my skin. I then bought the 8 inch ones and they are slightly to big for my taste because they end up wobbling around on my wrists, and I don't like that feeling. All in all though, great bracelets, they look beautiful, and I've had no problems with them. I will probably end up getting the adjustable ones, even though I don't like the look of the mechanism/chain."
4.0,"This hat was the largest offered , but is stilll tight. I'll have to have it streched a size larger.."
4.0,This was bought on a whim but has come to grow on me. Funny how that happens?
4.0,Elegant and well crafted.
4.0,Dress requires a slip underneath as you can see your bra. It‚Äôs a little short but it was perfect with a flannel tied around my waist while out shopping. Very comfortable.
4.0,"After trying all sorts of invisible socks that claim to be anti slip but start slipping down as soon as you start walking, these socks DO stay up. The only (minor) issue is that the string tends to roll upwards a bit and become quite visible."
4.0,"Looks better in pictures, in real life kinda fake looking even thought it is real 10k gold also the weight is very light"
4.0,"I liked this dress, the colors are true to what is advertised but this dress is not for large chested women.  I usually wear a size 10 and I ordered a large in this dress.  It fit everywhere else but in the chest area."
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this top!  All the Vivilli tops are excellent quality and very unique (I own three).  I would have given 5 stars if the sleeves were just a bit longer.  The length is terrific and the shape is loose, but with the princess seams it comes in at the waist a little to compliment nicely.  Can't wait to order some fall tops from them!"
4.0,Beautiful ! Love the color . A little smaller than I thought .
4.0,Looks really good but it's uncomfortable. Be careful too cos the sequins come off
4.0,The foot stocking are too big and uncomfortable. I wish it fit like a more like stock instead of a boot. Then you have to wear bigger boots which is make it make Clunky.
4.0,"I read up on this watch, and saw it was given a good review by a couple of different watch sites.  This watch looks a lot like a Rolex replica GMT Master that I received several years ago (except that one is brown and gold).  I only hope the movement will work out better.  The look, feel, and weight of the watch seem solid.  The one beef I have is the bracelet.  The look is great, and I like the fine adjustment under the clasp.  The only issue is that adjustment does not stay in place.  When I shorten it up (I have a very small wrist), the fine adjustment piece simply slides back to its widest setting.  It is not bad enough for me to return the watch, but annoying that I have to remove an extra link in order to get a good fit.  That makes it difficult to place on my watch winder.  Overall, I would say the price is about right.  I wouldn't pay much more for it."
4.0,Works well over my progressives and saves e from having to buy prescription sunglasses!
4.0,"I really love this shirt!!! The colors aren‚Äôt as vivid as I hoped but I still like the colors. Very comfortable, not fitted so it doesn‚Äôt cling to my body which I like. It‚Äôs thicker material for winter and it is also a nice length for leggings. I wear a 2xl and this fits as I hoped it would."
4.0,Was a birthday gift for a friend's son. He loved it. The customer runs a little small so I suggest if want longevity to buy next size up. Also seams need extra stitching.
4.0,"Ordered one size larger, per the other reviewers' comments, but it is WAY too big. Shouldve ordered closer to my size."
4.0,So dang cute! The fabric is very delicate so I don't think it will last very long though!
4.0,"It‚Äôs a really nice costume! My only issue is how it fits in the chest and shoulders. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 145-150 lbs. and I‚Äôm a 36 C. I ordered a large based on the other reviews. The fit is tight but not too tight to size up to and x-large. If you have sewing skills you could probably buy larger and take in the extra fabric. The length of the dress is about 2-3 inches longer then my knees. The trousers are thicker than expected and come to my lower calf upper ankle, which is a perfect length if you‚Äôre wearing boots or booties. The ruffles on the chest got a little messed up from being packaged. I plan on taking a steamer and some thread to fix that. The hat is a little weird but I think once that‚Äôs steamed it might look a little better but the fabric quality is good. It also came with some boot covers that I wasn‚Äôt expecting that are a cream colored leather and don‚Äôt really match the costume. I purchased some other boots so the covers won‚Äôt be necessary. I gave it four stars because the fabric is really nice and there is a lot of detail. I would recommend buying a tulle skirt for under the dress to add some volume as the actual dress is not super fluffy. You will need help zipping this up if you buy to size, the zipper runs below the butt and up to to top of my neck in the back. There is a draw string in the neck to help with fitting around the neck which is nice. You could definitely get away with adding more lace, ruffles, and bows to the costume. It comes with a good amount but more would look nice too. I am pleased with the costume but thought I would add a review with my sizes to help others!! I hope you like this as much as I do!"
4.0,Glad I ordered them .  My wife loves them .
4.0,Fits perfect exactly what i expected. Only issue is one of the capes had small holes in it.
4.0,"Satisfactory, a little stiff but good color."
4.0,"This swimsuit is so cute! I bought it to wear to an indoor water park, it's not quite warm enough to wear outside yet but i can't wait to wear it to the beach.  The material is great and it fit pretty much as expected (two pieces are never easy to buy as a set)  the colors on both the orange top and black bottoms are really vibrant. The only thing I wish is that the back of the top had a more secure closure besides a tie.  Other than that, this suit is perfect! I haven't worn a two piece in years but the high waist on this makes me feel really comfortable. Definitely follow the size guide. I am a 10, large and i ordered a 2xl. The bottoms fit more like an XL but they work.  Top definitely fits like a large"
4.0,Great slipper but did run a tad small<br />Print on it is adorable
4.0,"Gift for grandson who loved it.  Recommend sizing up if in doubt, runs slightly small, although may not be a full 1/2 size.  Item arrived on time.  Can't speak to how well it wears yet, haven't been worn that many times yet.  If it holds up well, will be a 5 star."
4.0,"delivered on time, enjoyed wearing it for the benefit of my dem. friends"
4.0,"The basic ball stud earrings 14k white gold. They are fine as pictured but hollow and bend easily, all posts were bent when i got them but they fixed easily."
4.0,"Good quality but i thought it is gonna be bigger!! Perfect color, I love the zipperü§©"
4.0,"Again, the cup size is slightly too small, but adjusting the straps helped reduce the boob overflow.  This is a very pretty and comfortable bra, and it reminds me of Victoria's Secret bras I purchased some years back.  I feel very pretty when I wear this bra, and for the price and fast shipping, I don't regret my purchase at all!"
4.0,"exactly as described. stretches a little too much, consider buying one size smaller than usual. otherwise, well worth it"
4.0,"This was my second purchase of these shoes, and my daughter LOVES them.  She gets a lot of compliments on both pairs, but sadly, the second pair were defective,  the stitching that holds the buckle in place on the shoe came loose on the second wear. :(  Unfortunately, my return window had passed on amazon,  so I'm going to have to get them repaired at a local shoe shop which will be around  $20.  I would still recommend this shoe, they are super cute and comfortable,  but make sure you wear them a few times before your return window closes to make sure of durability.  The first pair did not have this defect."
4.0,"I love this style of shoe, regardless of brand. I could walk in them all day. The only issue I have with this particular shoe is the part that goes over the top of my foot is tight, so my feet don‚Äôt comfortably go all the way in. So my heels tend to hang off the back of the shoe so they don‚Äôt feel too tight."
4.0,I suffer from Plantar fasciitis and achilles tendonitis. The first slip of the foot into these felt great. Good support overall but they could use a bit more arch support. Very comfortable!
4.0,"It's cute, basic, and keeps my prescription reading glasses safe from my cats! I smile when I look at that goofy moose - that's the best part of all!"
4.0,i like all the storage for cards. the ID slot is IMPOSSIBLE to get your id out of once its been put in. Also marks up very easily.
4.0,"I have been using this purse for a couple of weeks. The only thing it is missing is an outside pocket to put coupons and other papers I need to reach quickly. I have to put these papers inside now. The papers get all worn and torn inside. Other than this, I like the space inside. I like the handles and shoulder strap. They are comfortable and easy to use. I find it attractive and like the buckles. Live the red color."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but still good."
4.0,"Was very short, very cute but I prefer my tops to cover my mid section. The black and white polka dot is longer and fits much better."
4.0,i really like this cloak however the only thing i don't like it that it doesn't have a button or something to secure it on and closed my fix bought a separate button clip for it
4.0,"This denim dress is cute. However, they ran big. Nonetheless the seller is awesome very accommodating. Contact the seller before ordering so they can assist you with measurements."
4.0,Great bell
4.0,"The arm holes are small so i don't use them, made for skinny arms.  The side seams are too long also so i had to cut a few threads to make it fit better."
4.0,A bit thicker than I expected. Breathable.
4.0,Did Not Like The way this wallet smell.
4.0,Cute. My daughter wore this for her rainbow birthday party. Ripped the 1st time wearing it. It is really short! Much shorter than her other play tutu's! Shorts under is a must
4.0,These seemed small at first and once they were on they fit great!
4.0,Very pretty & dainty
4.0,"I ordered what was described as the black/white size 12. What I received was a navy/white in US Size 8 UK Size 12.  It was a tight fit but seemed like it would be a great suit. I was disappointed in the color description as I wanted a black suit but the navy is nice as well. I am returning to size up since it is too snug for me and I think they just grabbed the wrong size when it was shipped to me. Hoping I get the right size when I reorder. That said, the US Size 10 would likely fit as well. 5'4 158 lbs. Hope this helps!"
4.0,"Sorry fellas but no pictures‚Ä¶<br /><br />I got this Bra for my wife, and she liked it.<br />Positives:<br />- Great support and shape for your breast.<br />- The lace looks good.<br />- The Cup fits perfectly. My wife usually wears 34D and that is what we got. However‚Ä¶<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- The back dimensions are a bit off. After the fact my wife told me we should have gotten a 36D.<br />- After a while, comfort can be an issue. The frame gets annoyingly bothersome. The bra material can get itchy.<br />Other thoughts:<br />Given the pros and cons, I would still recommend it but size up on the back dimensions and I would wait for a good sale."
4.0,"Definitely got here faster than I expected. Good quality, definitely what I was looking for."
4.0,"I bought this for a photo shoot. It's just as pictured. It won't last forever though but for the price that is understandable. I like to put it back in the plastic sleeve it came in when I'm done, it helps it refold better."
4.0,"Love the feel of the dress. Fits me perfect. I'm 5""3 and the dress hits me right below the knee. I ordered an x-large because of my wide shoulders and  back.  Can snag easily."
4.0,"Perfect size, make my daughter happy"
4.0,"It is a nice light summer dress.  Being cotton, I expect it to wear well."
4.0,IT is super cute....but it is not quite big enough to hold US Dollars flat...so I just fold them in half in zipper section.  The credit card/drivers license slots are VERY tight.  For the price and cuteness though definatly worth it!
4.0,"Really nice shirt.  However, fit is very tight.  I am 168 5.9 and the large is almost firm fitting."
4.0,I like the dress fits as just as I would expect it's a little like costume material in a way but it's still super cute
4.0,Fits like a beanie. Much smaller than I thought but love the color and design
4.0,Moves a little but its manageable.
4.0,"I ordered this in red and it looks exactly like it does in the photos (well at least the color and style is exactly the same I wouldn't like to offer any comments as to comparisons to the model). The lace part on the bottom is fairly big and if you are smaller then you will have to tie it very tight which will leave quite a bit of ribbon leftover after tying your bow, but it can easily be trimmed if you are prepared for it and willing to take the time (which probably isn't the case at point of use). The top is very loose fitting as well and designed to work better for someone who is still very young and not particularly well endowed but it looks great and offers easy access.<br /><br />The quality is sturdy and I'm not worried about it being damaged in any shape or form. It looks exactly as it does in the photo, so don't worry about that - you are getting what's pictured (I know that's sometimes an issue!). My only real complaint is that it didn't come with an image or 'box' to show exactly what's what - it just came as a few pieces of material in a bag. Until you figure it out, it can be pretty confusing! But it didn't take long, and it was as expected.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,This is a cute dress - but not for my figure - I gave 4 stars because the quality is very good and the color was really nice.  Just didn't fit me.
4.0,The skirt is great for tennis and golf because the pocket that is upside down is to hold a golf ball or tennis ball while you are playing.
4.0,Good puffer coat for the price but material is a bit stiff.  The inside is same as outside material.  It works but just wish it had been a softer puffer coat like some are.
4.0,got this for my daughter in law who loved it.
4.0,"Very cute and nice for price. Yet to see if the claim of no changing of colors holds up. But I like it. Will update stars upon wearing a bit longer, just received today along with the others in the set."
4.0,"I'm 5'3 and 135 lbs and I bought a medium. I love the pattern in the sleeves. I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the fabric is a touch see-through and the hem line is a little weird. The front and the back of the skirt are longer but the sides look higher than the photograph. Not high where I feel uncomfortable, but high enough to look a little off. Overall the pattern is beautiful and I'm sure I will wear it a lot even with the wonky hem."
4.0,Nice tanks. Soft and comfortable.
4.0,"es comodo para largos trayectos, y tiene muchos espacios interesantes para acomodar el equipaje, pero no es del todo impermeable  y se mantiene por mucho tiempo humedo."
4.0,"Excellent travel toiletry bag - it's a little large for just a weekend trip, but for my two-week business trip to Asia it definitely came in handy."
4.0,"Update July 10, 2017<br />I decided to button this vest/dress up and low and behold none of the button holes  were finished including the pocket button holes. Fortunately, I sew so (no pun intended :) I had the tools necessary to open the button holes up properly. Hopefully, yours will come finished. If not take it to a Fabric store and have them help you. It only takes a couple of minutes. The smell is completely gone and it is what I wanted.<br /><br />I followed the size information in the description but when I got the vest the sizes were different. It states that 5 extra large is extra large in US size, but according to the description 5xlg is 3xlg. I got bigger so I could wash it without worry of the shrinkages and not being able to wear the vest. Instead it just fits me, but barely. It also has a smell but it is already disappearing quickly. It arrived before the date it was to be delivered."
4.0,A little bit big but nice quality shirt
4.0,"Good material and nice materials.  It runs large, and it is too big for a smaller wrist."
4.0,"Bought as a gift so didn‚Äôt actually wear these.  Cute, good quality."
4.0,"Great cardigan! Lightweight, thin material but still looks professional. After reading previous comments, I ordered a size bigger and it fits perfectly!"
4.0,Got my shirt very quickly and will be perfect for my pi day themed day in my classroom
4.0,Two words.<br /><br />Kenshin Himura.
4.0,"Good quality, but it could stand to be a little bigger."
4.0,Very roomy and comfy. Pretty color. But very see thru. I bought them for a music festival so not a huge deal as they are wearable in that particular situation but I wouldn‚Äôt wear them for everyday life. Lounge at home tho‚Ä¶absolutely.
4.0,"I love these shoes, they're perfect for my 5 year old, the only issue is the elastic in the middle snapped off both within a day. Other then that they're great and durable."
4.0,"Good quality,<br />Help ease eye strain with computer work."
4.0,Looks good on my 6 year old son. Thought it came with the inner turtleneck top but I didn‚Äôt read it right. I went by the pic it had. It would of went well with it but so far looks good with a regular top inside
4.0,"If you were looking for a slim wallet this one is very slim. I bought it for my husband to has been looking for another wallet for a few years as his is held together by duct tape. However, this was much to slim and small for his needs. If someone didn't have as many cards as he has it would probably work well for them."
4.0,this is not at all a true to size product in fact they dont even make them bigger.having a problem with return its costly 1 dollar for return label deducted and 4 dollars for return so far 5 dollars have been wasted on deduction at return when the dress was not true to size in the first place.so a 30 dollar dress will be credited only 25 in the end dont waste your time from china sizing
4.0,Very comfortable and keep feet warm.
4.0,"Larger than I care for so went with another brand (I am probably a B-cup, don't wear bras.) Would probably be good on a larger areola."
4.0,"Perfect size.  Handbag is very nice quality. Hand holds interfere slightly shoulder wear, slender shoulders may experience no interfearance."
4.0,My husband loves his sweatshirt with the fleece lining  It‚Äôs very warm<br />Fits just right
4.0,Loved the design wore it for about a week till my belly button become red and sore which was weird cause I have had my belly pierced for years that's the only down side I saw for this belly button ring but I still love it!!
4.0,"This is super cute and overall quite comfy. Although it fits well the material doesn't have any stretch so depending on your body shape it might not stay like its supposed to. My friend and I are about the same size and I had her try it on as well, It fit us both fairly well, but with my body shape being a little cushier then hers the bottom of the shirt kept rolling up and I had a hard time keeping it in place. With her being in better shape then me it fit her better in the sense that it stayed where it was supposed to and didn't roll up at all."
4.0,The collar fitted great and so did the apron
4.0,It was a little bigger then it stated and what I expected...but still pretty!bigger
4.0,Great fit and great feel
4.0,"I kept this because I was offered a slight discount if I did so. I'm glad I did. The fit was large so I placed it in a lingere bag and wash in warm water and rinsed in warm water.  Then, still in the bag, I dried it in a hot drier. That shrunk it enough to make it fit nicely. Now, I love the sweater!  It fits beautifully. And, it's made nicely for the price. It is fairly thin, but I need this since I am very warm blooded."
4.0,Brought this for my daughter for her swim class. It serves its purpose.
4.0,"This fit is great. I have a hard time finding Extra Small usually. I wish the fabric was a little thicker, but other than that I ‚ù§Ô∏è."
4.0,"Nice jacket,but it's sheds a lot. If I wear something dark under it ,when I take the jacket off I am covered with red lint. Not cool for such an expensive thing"
4.0,"Overall this is a great product that absolutely gives you a shape to be thrilled with however my one complaint is the legs. It's supposed to have stay put legs that won't creep up and a touch of ""sexy"" lace, well on my very large legs they did not stay in place. They bunched up near my pelvic area and the rubber like stuff inside pulled at my skin and dug into my legs very painfully. I wore this for 10 hours and that's my only complaint really. I may order the version without the longer legs and see how that goes."
4.0,it's a nice belt
4.0,Love these! So cute on my daughter. They fit a 2year old very well. Made well.
4.0,"I really want to five-start these, but I just wish the leg openings were a tad wider. Everything about it fits fine, it just feels a tad snug around the leg. I prefer loose soccer shorts, but not so loose as to be confused with basketball shorts. Somewhere in between these and basketball shorts would be perfect!<br /><br />Otherwise, these are well-made, high quality, and decent for the cost."
4.0,Very good product.  I appreciate it.
4.0,Pretty good for price.
4.0,"Fit great! I have a smaller sized head/face and usually have a difficult time finding a pair of sunglasses that fit; I usually have to constantly adjust them while I wear them, but didn't have to push these up repeatedly on the bridge of my nose. Frames are cute, but large."
4.0,Very cute but had a random stain on the back...like the white faded purple? (Makes no sense ). Returning and ordering a new one.  Hope it works.
4.0,"I got this for my wife obviously since she says Rose Gold is ""in"" this year.<br /><br />She really likes it however it is very slightly a bit over the top in terms of appearance bling than she is used to. She will still wear it for very special occasions, but doesn't think of it as an everyday watch. She might be a bit more modest than others.<br /><br />However, if BLING IS YO THANG! Then yes, this Relic watch from Fossil is probably a very good buy. The looks of a super expensive rose gold watch, but it really isn't. Actually Relic might be considered the lower end Kohl's type offering from Fossil.<br /><br />We do not know about water resistance because we did not want to test that purposely and I don't ever wear a watch swimming or taking a bath because I have no need to; washing hands is about the limit and that's very little water splashing if any.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars, but look very closely at the picture I uploaded if you are okay with that amount of BLING BLING."
4.0,Everything is perfect except for the color. The dark green shown on the photo turned out to be a medium green/army green.
4.0,Fit's my 12 year old daughter perfectly.
4.0,nice - arrived earlier than expected. Thank you
4.0,"Too bad it doesn't have RFID blocking,but I'm satisfied"
4.0,"Looked nice but too small, returned."
4.0,Nice dress but order size up
4.0,They are cool but too small but i like them
4.0,Very nice looking wallet and passport holder.
4.0,This would be my favorite shirt if it didn't fit so tight.
4.0,"The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because the sole could be a bit comfier. It's just a bit harder plastic than I wished for. However, for the price they look fantastic, the color is exactly as pictured (I got the brown)"
4.0,"Looks great just a little thin, might wear easily."
4.0,"This short is one of my favorites. If you decide to order it, you will not be disappointed in that it could be dressed up or down."
4.0,Came all curly like other reviewers stated.  I placed it in a fold of tissue paper and used my flat iron on the lowest setting and it straightened right out.  Don't let the direct heat touch the filament or I'm sure it would melt.
4.0,Keep me warm when the weather is frigid.
4.0,It‚Äôs cool it is lightweight which is nice. The straps leave a lot to be desired I‚Äôm a big guy and I had to tie them up so the mask wouldn‚Äôt fall off kind of a pain in the butt
4.0,"Strong odor upon unpackaging but that's not a huge deal, just a plastic smell which will hopefully go away in the wash. Cute print and good fit. I'm 200lbs and 5'10 and I got the 16 plus. Just a tad too big with the shoulders. Probably could have gotten away with a size smaller but it's not unwearable. Still very cute!"
4.0,"I love these shorts! They said exactly as advertised and the color is really great. I bought the purple ones. Don't be afraid when you take them out of the box if they look small they have a lot of stretch and will totally fit as advertised. My only issue is that I bought one of the larger sizes and the tie that goes around the waist wasn't correspondingly longer, but that's not a huge issue. Overall very happy"
4.0,Super cute the star cuffs are perfect but the pearl and jewel ones  are sharp in the back and make my ear red
4.0,This is a comfortable bra though the sizing is a little difficult to get right
4.0,These earrings were a lot bigger then I thought they would be.  Very pretty.
4.0,Really pretty and fits good!
4.0,I order this for my son as he can slip it on and of with ease. It can hang comfortably around his neck when it's not being used to cover his face.  The pattern is neat too.<br />The only downside is the smell.  I would recommend washing before wearing as the smell is a bit overpowering.
4.0,"I wear a 12Wide and it came labelled as a 12W in a 12W box, but was too short and too narrow.  They have a 13W, but I probably need a 13WW, and they don't offer that.  It's a shame too, because I researched a lot of shoes, and grew up knowing the Florsheim reputation.  This is a NICE SHOE.  If it fits you I think you'll love it.<br /><br />Obviously very well constructed.  Soles are a two-piece outer that can be resoled when these wear.  The ones they come with look like a standard Vibram style, which is legendary, but come resole time you can get that are a myriad of other sole types.<br /><br />Excellent leather and insole is removable if you want to replace with an ortho insert like I do (I use Powerstep Wide).<br /><br />If you care for this leather, these shoes will probably last through at least one resole, if not a few.<br /><br />For the price it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />Everyone else said buy in your size and they got a perfect fit.  Wasn't my case, but majority rules, so give 'em a try.  Return is painless."
4.0,"These were very cute, but unfortunately these are too small for the average adult. I bought them for vacation but ended up giving them away because the arms were too short. That aside, decent quality and great view."
4.0,"Absolutely great for the price.  Unbelievable Value.  Could never find anything like it elsewhere.  Again, I love Amazon!"
4.0,"A bit flimsy, but way cute for a thumb ring."
4.0,Love!!! A little long but it is Soo pretty
4.0,"My boyfriend absolutely loves the watch. He said it looks sexy and that it's comfortable feeling. But it did not come with the necessary tools to adjust the watch. If it did, this would've been a 5 stars. If you have the necessary tools to adjust good hell yeah but the watch."
4.0,"I bought this wrap in the burgundy color and it's lightweight, soft and comfortable.<br /><br />I am 5'3"" and weigh 160lbs and I purchased  the XL. I washed it in cold water and dried it on medium heat and it shrunk. It didn't shrink a lot but I wish I had gotten the XXL because I like my wraps to be roomy. I don't want to flash anyone which is why I wear the wrap. ;)<br /><br />The velcro isn't scratchy,  the pocket is a nice feature and the material has a waffle pattern on it. I would buy this again but in a bigger size."
4.0,"Loved the feel of the band. Very smooth and pliable. The spring bars were just a hair larger so I used my old ones and it went on perfect. I ordered a 22mm which I used in the past with leather and synthetic bands. Maybe with the built in spring bars there isnt as much flex for clearance,I'm guessing that's it. When installing on my Timex Expedition,I used the stock bars that came with the watch and put them in this band and it fit perfect. Other than that,I'm very pleased with the band."
4.0,Comfortable and easy to break-in for work......Color lighter than expected
4.0,"Shirt fits well but, it is very warm!!! It‚Äôs hard to wear it for every day use - I just wear it when I go outside."
4.0,Fits on the smaller side but it‚Äôs comfortable
4.0,It was exactly what was posted in the review. The gloves run a little small but stretch. The material isnt great. Imagine the gloves you buy for girls when they play dress up. That's what the material of the gloves and thong feels like. The pearls are plastic like fake pearls you'd buy at a novelty store. The pasties work well. Overall I'm satisfied with the product. I've included a link to a photo of the item unpacked. [...]
4.0,I ordered a 3XL based on reviews saying it ran small. I am 5'6&#34; and 225 and curvy! It was too big in the arms and in the back area! I could have ordered a 1x (xl) for the more snug look I was looking for. I am returning the item. Also it is very sheer u definitely need to wear a slip or bra n shaper depending on the look ur going for.
4.0,"Very pretty, and you can move the arms to adjust for your updo."
4.0,"These slippers are very comfortable once you break them in.  It takes about 2 weeks.  Now I hardly feel that they are on.  The only thing that I am not totally in love with these is they take two hands to put on.  I wish they were slip ons but every other pair that I tried didn't really slip on as I wished.  Also, be aware that these slippers have a fabric bottom so they are not good for outdoor use.  I recommend these slippers."
4.0,"I ordered a large Amazon thankfully sent a XL it fits great, I'm 5'10&#34; 165lbs"
4.0,"Nice wide brim but doesn't fit my big head so I'll never get to wear it. Ventilation is great, just what I wanted (but too small)."
4.0,Looked awesome for my costume!
4.0,The only negative were the gloves. They tore when I flexed my hands. It's not sewn in a way that feels comfortable to normal human hands. My guess is it was a rush job. That aside I loved everything else. The coat is worth the money alone. For the money you're not going to be disappointed. Just find something to replace those gloves.
4.0,This shirt runs big and fits weird (at least on me). It looks just like the picture though.
4.0,Love this. Only thing is that is kinda see through. I bought white slip to go under it
4.0,"Such a cute bathing suit. I was hesitant to purchase but reviews are so helpful! I ordered a medium- the bottom was perfect (no digging in my hips, perfect minimal back coverage). The bottom was JUST what I was looking for. The top however was too small with little support (did not have high hopes to begin with- really just wanted the bottom). I have a friend who I can give it to.  I'm 115 lb, 5'4, 30ddd.<br /><br />I'm giving a 4 star due to the tacky sticky residue that the liner protector left (see pic). I was able to scratch it all off with my fingernail but took a little while. No damage done. Very Satisfied with my purchase overall."
4.0,"My niece will grow into it, but don't believe the size chart. She measured 34&#34; but the medium hangs on her so she sleeps in it."
4.0,"Very cute, even though cheaply made (the ruffle skirt has no hem at the bottom). The color is as pictured."
4.0,"Nice shirt, good quality. Order dizebup."
4.0,I like the way it fits.. but the stitching under the bra area is somewhat scratchy..
4.0,The pants and vest are excellent but everything else is pretty generic.
4.0,"Very good the only issue is, no functional chin strap. But I would buy it again!"
4.0,"value for money, order next size larger to fit"
4.0,"It‚Äôs as described. I thought our dog could wear this but his head was too big to fit through the neck then again, it wasn‚Äôt intended for a dog."
4.0,The stones were bigger than expected but I like the earrings. I probably would not purchase them again but that is more due to my preferences than the item itself.
4.0,"I am 5'5,185 pounds, and wear a 36DD bra. I ordered an xxl in this dress because of the reviews and sizing chart. Im normally a 12/14 anyway. The dress runs a bit big, i would prefer an xl. All in all great quality."
4.0,Purchased this hat to wear at camp next year.  Have high hopes that it will be air conditioned enough for the high temperatures in the mountains.
4.0,"It's quite short for a 'maxi dress. I am 5' about 150lbs, so I purchased a large. It hides my upper arms and other trouble areas nicely, but hits about an inch above my ankles. Being short, I expected to have to hem it to a length I liked, which is almost touching the ground. Im keeping the dress because it does fit great apart from the length."
4.0,"this bracelet is very nice, i got it as a gift, and luckly, the gift is for a teenager, as its is kind of narrow... other than that, the quality is great, stones sparkles, and overall look very pretty"
4.0,I was skeptical getting this Jumper. I am 5ft less than 120lbs.  It fits well easy to put on and very comfortable for summer. Can easily add on a undershirt or sweater.  It fits better than I had exspected because I'm not as tall as average people. Material is sturdy but stretchy It is easy to go to the bathroom in a hurry even thou its one piece you can quickly take it off or put it on. I  find I get more compliments than I ever exspected when I wear  this jumper.
4.0,"For the price, these are cute earrings (I mean, if you expect Tiffany-quality jewelry at this price, you are delusional). I wear the same 2 or 3 pairs of studs in my ears the majority of the time, and I can do that with these. They don‚Äôt irritate my ears and they have a nice sparkle to them. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll wear the largest size (the ones I am holding in the picture) - they are just too obviously fake. The ones I am wearing are the 3rd largest size. I like those."
4.0,"I ordered this dress for an outdoor wedding. I‚Äôm usually hesitant to buy dresses online, because I‚Äôm short and they‚Äôre usually WAY too long on me. However, this one fits really great and is super cute. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù, 115lbs and it is a little short, so I feel like it would be super short on someone with long legs. I do love it though!"
4.0,Using it to hold my cooler on my boat swim platform looks good lays nice and flat
4.0,I have received many compliments on these flats. They are comfortable and I wear them all day at work. The only issue is there is only very little padding in the footbed and no arch.
4.0,I like the polarized look. I had to tighten and adjust frames when received.  Great price
4.0,"These tweezers are sturdy, lightweight and useful for edc purposes like grabbing very small screws, for example. But, they‚Äôre not very good for grabbing very small and thin things like hair."
4.0,"Slightly large, but workable. Cute casual top."
4.0,Daughter like it fast shipping
4.0,Myh friends even asked where I got them...
4.0,"Really happy, with the quality. I mean I haven't used them yet, but, they look really nice. It was hard to find some with brass ends. Happy."
4.0,These shoes are very well made for the price.  The color is really pretty too but they seem to run a whole size large.  I have put insoles and heel guards in them so I can wear them.  I wish I could have ordered a 4.5 instead of a 5.5 but I will make them work.
4.0,"Maybe I had unrealistic expectations but this baby Baphomet was‚Ä¶quite small. Still very cute, though, and seems well-made!"
4.0,Happy with these casual garments.  Low prices for these easy to wear clothes.
4.0,"Material is pretty stretchy. I'm a 32H and a medium fits comfortably. It's slightly shorter then I was expecting but still long enough to not be too short. It feels different then I expected, it's not soft but not uncomfortable at all either. I'm not confident in the design staying after a few washes but we will see."
4.0,"I love these sandals so much! Gotten lots of compliments. Unfortunately, on the first pair the clasp broke right after I put them on so I had to return them but immediately bought another pair."
4.0,My favorite color is purple and this bag does not disappoint. The bag pictured is exactly what was shipped. It has a lot of really good pockets including one that sits on the back side of the bag so people can't just reach in when you're walking on the street. My only complaint are the straps. I just cannot get them to fit right. One side will be loose and the other one is tight so the bag gets lopsided. It may be user error.
4.0,Was nice. 4 stars for packaging. Came covered in lint inside the bag. Was not presentable at all but once cleaned they look very nice
4.0,"Love the band but the pin on one the didn't want to stay clicked on, in two days it has popped apart 3 times already.  I tried a different pin from the pack with same result."
4.0,I got a lot of compliments. Fit as expected. The material is almost like a jersey knit. I thought it would be more of a Cotten blend. It doesn‚Äôt take away from the dress though.
4.0,Love this fits great. I'm 5'2 and 138lbs bought a small and it fit In love.Reason for 4 stars is the writing started to crack after on wear.
4.0,I‚Äôm a size 18 and I ordered a 2X and it fit perfect. The material is forgiving which is nice. The print on the skirt is beautiful and I received lots of compliments at the dinner I wore it too.
4.0,"Cheap and beautiful watch it works as expected for a watch in this price segment, came on a plastic bag with a cleaning cloth and well packed in a big box with air bags so it was protected. The looks and design of it, is really nice the belt has red stiching that makes it look more expensive<br />Great watch good buy"
4.0,"So Cute! Fits great, beautiful colors,  like everything about it, except for the hand wash thing. But, really like it"
4.0,I love the hood..but its very light weight..i had to put on another garment with it to be warm on a cool day...other than that..i liked it..
4.0,"It's not quite as long as pictured, so I'll be wearing it as a tunic. If I had great legs I'd probably wear it as a dress. The pom-pom trim was kind of a surprise as I ordered from my phone and didn't notice it. Still debating about removing it. It did have a slight kerosene smell upon arrival as many items from China do, but it went away after washing. I was pleasantly surprised that it came out of the dryer ready to wear without ironing. (I hate ironing!) After it arrived and I saw the material I fully expected it to be wrinkled after machine drying. Cute print with a  bohemian feel. It does run small so order up a couple of sizes like I did and it should fit fine. Definitely worth the low price paid and wait for arrival."
4.0,"Just slightly small.  Looks good for lunch out here in NYC.  Easily dressed up.  Haven't washed it yet, but to be safe will use cold water and no dryer."
4.0,I'll enjoy wearing them.
4.0,So the jacket seems durable. It fits well and the size I ordered fits like it should. Only issue I‚Äôm having is that it sheds a lot. On the inside. I‚Äôve washed it twice now and whatever I wear under it has little yellow fuzzy strands all over it. Not really pleased with that.
4.0,"The bag was really big, I didn't expect that. I wanted a smaller bag, but this is very spacious and can hold a lot. I like the handle part because the pattern is pretty and nice. I also really like the tan color"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:480db36b32bcd11a0998d9e2ff9f13c0]] They look different than pictured. They have these weird edge‚Ä¶.but they are cute.
4.0,The earring look just like the picture and the backs were easy to get on.
4.0,it's original and pretty
4.0,"I love the tops but they run small. Be sure to go up a size. Not only do they run small, they also shrink in the dryer. I'm hanging to dry from now on."
4.0,Not what I thought they were I already have key rings I wanted something to hold my measuring cups
4.0,"The material is quite heavy, and it seems to be made very well. It fit great everywhere, but was much too big in the waist, which didn't give me the nipped in waist and hourglass shape I was hoping for. Instead it just made me look frumpy, so unfortunately, I am returning it."
4.0,Hard to believe the price!! Looks beautiful. Just a little too big on my wrist.
4.0,It's a pretty dress and fun but the straps don't fit great.
4.0,i am size 14 ordered xl but needed xxl
4.0,Slightly tight..<br />floats on water<br />Protects<br />Perfect for the price
4.0,"My boyfriend has been looking around for more of an &#34;adult&#34; wallet.  With RFID being essential nowadays, I decided to purchase this wallet.<br /><br />-1 star as a personal preference.  After feeling the wallet in my hands, it does not feel like quality-premium leather.  My suggestion: remove this part of the description and offer a variety of colors.<br /><br />The wallet comes in a nice black box; presentable enough as a gift.  The wallet is held together nicely with tissue paper and they also added a Silica packet to control the humidity and prevent degradation.<br /><br />The left side is meant to hold 3 cards, but you can definitely fit more in there.  The right side has a clear plastic window for your I.D.  Both sides have pockets to store cash, receipts, etc.  There is also a pocket on the outside to store more items.  The RFID blocking technology also gives peace of mind.<br /><br />Although my boyfriend already bought himself a wallet, he liked this one better because of how slim it is.  He immediately switched out everything to this wallet! Score!<br /><br />I received this item for free and have provided a clear and honest review."
4.0,"It's a great quality belt, though I would've preferred it to be more of a raven-black than a brown-black."
4.0,"Very pretty dress and decent quality for the price.  However, the white dress is an off white color. It looks like a winter white or very subtle cream color but decided to keep it anyway. It also runs smaller than expected. First purchased a small based on the size chart and my daughter is normally a size 4.  It was too small so got a medium. It is also a little snug in the waist and chest but decided to keep the medium fearing the large would be too long.  The picture is not clear but the back has some lining (on the lower portion - straps and upper half are all lace) so that it is not all see through lace."
4.0,Great value fun otem
4.0,Es divertido y llama el atencion sus cambios de color
4.0,"my 7 year old had to widen out the sides. then they did fit her okay. they come with individual cloth cases. the ""glass"" is plastic."
4.0,"I LOVE THESE!! Simplicity makes badass leggings & I just came on Amazon to order another pair. I was hesitant w these bc they seem to be one size fits all, & I'm just under 6 foot. A little snug but no muffin top w that thick, comfy waistband!! üëçüèª"
4.0,It arrived quickly as was as advertised
4.0,"Love the shirt, but size up. I am glad I did. It runs about a size small."
4.0,Not very snug in the hips. Could make a pear figure look larger. Will definitely make a straight figure look more curvy.
4.0,Really good material! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 about 125lbs and got a medium it was a bit big on me but it was good enough!
4.0,"Lovely ring, very pretty and reasonably priced."
4.0,"Plenty of other uses have shown their pics. First on, this band looks great! Only complaint about the quality is that the band isn't made of actually individual links but coils of wire. As such, you can see some rough cuttings at the very sides of the band as my pictures shows.<br /><br />The other con to this band is that it takes some work to get it fitted correctly - you'll need a Dremel with a cutoff wheel or snippers and needle nose pliers to fish out left over bits of metal."
4.0,"Cute dress, quality good. Ttight around the top for a bigger chested girl. Fit everywhere else was fine but the top section cut right through the middle of my chest and was very unflattering. Returned."
4.0,My son brought these for himself and they are just as expected.
4.0,Love mine!
4.0,pretty close to what I was looking for.  I am satisfied.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but the fit is a little odd. If I had a longer torso it would probably fit better. I went by the size chart and will need to have it tailored down in the shoulder and bust. I am 5'4&#34;, 165lbs, 38D and ordered the XL, but the entire top is baggy and unwearable. That said, it's gorgeous and with some tailoring it will be beautiful and flattering."
4.0,It is thicker then I expected and smaller too. Love the color and pattern.
4.0,"Not bad, a little more gold than purple, as expected in the picture. The metal clasp is strong and sturdy though! And it's really comfortable."
4.0,"I have found that brown earrings go well with my skin.  These were a little larger than i expected, however i still like them."
4.0,"Don't get me wrong, these are very nice boots. Fit great and comfortable. The colour is a bit different from the photo.... not as light/creamy, more yellowish/tan, hard to explain... just not quite what I was expecting. But I have never worn a pair of light coloured boots before so they just seem strange to me somehow. I will probably grow to love them after they are broken in and get a bit beat up. Maybe they are just too new looking!"
4.0,The are really nice. The quality is so good which is why I have it 4stars. I just wish they didn‚Äôt run so small. I ordered them for my daughter. Typically a small/med is good for her she is about 4‚Äô9 120lbs has well shaped bottom so the medium fit just right w/o any give. So I‚Äôm going to return them & buy the large & XL to see which one fits best. If the Xl is too big maybe I will keep them for me.
4.0,"Very stylish!!!! If your heavy @ da top, u will have to use the halter straps. The bottom piece didn't have much stomach support, but it does rise high enough to cover stomach"
4.0,"Decent for money. Feel cheaper than expected but the lens is very clear and blocks bright sun without making too dark.  They do look good on me. I do like the hinged arms , much better than most in this price point. Wide wide lens so caution to those with narrow faces. Good side coverage is the benefit of wide lenses.<br /><br />I would be very careful when handling these. One drop to ground or partially sitting on them may do them in.  If they are metal frames then it's a cheap pot metal that appears to be very brittle. Time will tell how durable they are.<br /><br />***UPDATE***  These turned out to be a lot better than I originally reported.  I would highly recommend them for the money.  A few people have commented on them and said they look a lot  higher end than a 13.00 pair of sunglasses.  I noticed the hinged arms keep them snug to the head but not irritating.  The lens is alot like a pair of Oakleys I have so if you are wondering how dark the tint is through them, try on a pair of Oakleys and they are about the same.  I would buy again if lost , broken, or stolen ( highly possible).  I buy alot of sub $20.00 sunglasses and I would say these are some of the best in that price range."
4.0,Great looking glasses - a little light weight and a small scratch on the arm - but worth the price.
4.0,Cute dress. This kind of material fades easily in the wash. It is a little on the big side.
4.0,Very big. My daughter wears size 13 and I ordered size 13 but had to return it because it was almost 2 sizes bigger on her.
4.0,Nice suit but not for me.
4.0,Some fit some don't. Quality of fabric is great for the price.
4.0,"I ordered a large because of my long torso since that‚Äôs usually my issue with bodysuits, but this one seemed a bit big. It gapped out awkwardly at the armpits (see pictures) but I like it so much I sent it back and am trying a medium. Hopefully it fits! Quality is good and I like that it‚Äôs a thong - they‚Äôre hard to find!"
4.0,"Super cute and comfy, had to return it because it was too short"
4.0,I was borderline btwn to sizes. The fit along the shoulders was off in the small. It's like the straps were to short or something. medium fit perfect!
4.0,"It's really nice, bought it for my Minotaur outfit for this upcoming Halloween, looks pretty much like the picture, I like it but I think it could have been less pricey"
4.0,"Very pretty and super light weight. They sometimes catch on my shoulder when I turn my head, but mostly I‚Äôm very pleased with them."
4.0,I wish this came larger. A must have staple. Too small. My measurements are 38-30-42.
4.0,Great gift- large and material seems quality.
4.0,These really aren't my favorite pair of earrings. Though they definitely seem high quality and well made I find them a bit small. Just not as cute as I wanted them to be. But that's just a matter of my personal taste and no reflection on the earrings themselves which are very pretty overall.
4.0,Good item . Well worth the price.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute,but super thin. Would not recommend for winter. It‚Äôs more of a spring jacket."
4.0,"The material is thinner than I thought. It's like a tee shirt. I could've ordered a size smaller, but I will stick with the one I have. Overall I still like it. Looks like the picture."
4.0,Very comfy. I thought I would hate these but now I wear them almost everyday
4.0,This is a very comfortable casual top. I love the toned down colors and it will be worn a lot this summer.
4.0,In the chest is a little loose
4.0,"Everything exactly as advertised, but I wished that the belt would be slightly longer by about 2 inches."
4.0,"A bit baggy, but cute shirt and good quality material."
4.0,Bought two of these for gifts and my mom and mother in law likes them
4.0,It's nice. Quality is decent and it arrived quickly. I gifted to a friend for a baby shower gift.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  It is very pretty and she loved it but after wearing it for a couple of weeks the chain broke.
4.0,I like how it‚Äôs a beanie and a Bluetooth headphone at the same time.
4.0,wish I had ordered a size smaller. I ordered a large and wear a 36D. this bra is a little loose but still really cute
4.0,A LITTLE HEAVY ON THE NOSE.
4.0,These pants are awesome! A little big but they are really comfortable
4.0,Light weight but warm. Great fit.
4.0,This suit fits great just don't recommend white. I also ordered a black and love it!!
4.0,Very nice coloring and lace detail.  The silky feel is great and pleasant not itchy or anything.  The bottom has the little lace covered slits.  Adds a bit of sexy to it.  I can easily pair it with an ivory colored robe if I needed to cover up any.  I washed on cold and hung to dry and had no issues.  I did wash it by itself in case of the dye bleeding.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,"Very nice for the price, It is a gift and I am sure this cancer victim  will love it!"
4.0,My daughter loved these but they broken a few months after daily wear.
4.0,Christmas gift for an 8yo!  She is SO happy with it!
4.0,"Great sweatshirts. Bought 2 a couple months ago and just recently before Christmas bought 2 more. I'm 165lbs and 5'9&#34; with a normal build and the Medium size fits great. It definitely shrinks a tiny bit after washing but if I bought a large it would've been way to big even after washing. With all that said I'm still eventually going to buy 2 more. Haha so that should tell you this is a great crew neck for this price anywhere. And lastly all the colors I have (black,ash,maroon,purple) were true to thier colors in the pictures."
4.0,Very comfy and a good fit! Like them a lot and the price was good!
4.0,"Not your average Lowe's hat! Have received many compliments<br />& just as many, if not more, inquiries of where I purchased this<br />hat. Great design. Love the all-black theme. Sole reason I didn't<br />give 5 stars? I like my hats to sit a bit deeper. That's a personal<br />preference. Others may be perfectly content with the fitment.<br />Job well done BOIN!"
4.0,Excellent quality material as is described.
4.0,Very durable holds a lot
4.0,Other than being a little short the product is spot on!
4.0,"Arrived fast, looks great! Haven't used since it is a birthday gift for 9/28. Thank you!"
4.0,"There's a nice weight to these.  They look very sharp.  The chains are a little cheap.  The clasp on the men's broke, and I had to replace the chain.  I was planning on replacing the chain anyways."
4.0,I like it as a cute casual dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 150 lbs 38D the girls were squished but the laces that tie it hid most of the look. The ready is very flowy and big. I think it looked good hides everything.
4.0,For the price it looks nice
4.0,"I got medium and have a 32‚Äù waist and they are just bordering on tight‚Äînot uncomfortable enough to return them, though. But I love the feel and look of these boxers and wear them all the time. The button fly is great to prevent ‚Äúflop outs.‚Äù"
4.0,Live this dress. Its very comfortable and light.
4.0,I loved it the only down side is that my finger gets black :( but to replace my engagement ring is good since I am not a jewelry person I forget where I put my rings after washing my hands
4.0,I ordered a medium because that's my size. The jogger fits my tights but too big for my waist. And the top is a little snug and shorter than expected but overall I like its still cute üòç
4.0,"Really nice. Well constructed, pretty."
4.0,Very comfortable but would slip back while asleep.
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes up. I probably could have only gone up 1 size and it would have been perfect. Still fits and is prettu good quality.
4.0,Cute easy ti handle !
4.0,Very nice first few uses then not so much glitter as you get in there added my own I just love sparles
4.0,My head is exactly 23 inches. I tucked some velcro tape (the soft side) in around the band and it fits perfectly now. I would rather it start large. I've been wearing it out for walks lately and so far it has held up in the wind. I could rig up an elastic band to tuck under the back of my hair if it becomes a problem.
4.0,Nice wallet... Too much to ship...
4.0,"So I requested this shirt because the ad shows that the shirt‚Äôs flat layer goes to around waist height before going into the babydoll layers. Upon receiving it, I immediately noticed that the waist is way higher than what is shown in the ad. The color is a little darker than the lighter nude color online as well (looks more like a dark sand color). I ordered a large but it was a lot wider than I normally wear. Material is very soft so it is comfortable to wear. However the fit of the shirt (both size wise and length) as well as color is way off. I had to use a belt to cinch it in around my waist but even then, it doesn‚Äôt look right as the ruffles start right under my bust area (again, very different from the image in the ad where it‚Äôs at the waist). Nice quality of material but wouldn‚Äôt personally buy again."
4.0,"The fit was as expected, the print was really vivid so expect that when selecting your color and choice.<br />Great for everyday wear."
4.0,Got them as a gift for my niece. She loves them
4.0,Its a really nice dress thbought a medium and i feel like im drowning it it. I normally take a medium and i feel like i need a small just for it to fit snuggly. Kind of disappointed...
4.0,Pretty little bracelet. Dainty. Looks like it would hold up to younger girls.
4.0,"I love my pink sunglasses but they were getting old and wanted to replace with new ones. Unfortunately, I have ordered pink sunglasses twice now and keep getting BLUE which is not a color option. I think Amazon is  trying to tell me something so I finally kept the blue ones. I am ordering the orange and red sunglasses offered by this brand now to see what will be delivered. Will update post later."
4.0,"I ordered the skirt on October 2 and received it on October 21.  It came in a nice reusable zippered PVC pouch with yet another reusable dust cover like tote inside to store it in if you wish.  The fabric is a thick, super heavy and warm wool blend.  The skirt is lined and even the pockets are lined!  The zipper in the back is a very heavy duty exposed zipper and there are hanging ribbons inside the skirt as well.  I ordered the size 4 and it is a bit snug ( Will feel/fit better when I am not bloated from eating bread üòâ),  I wear a size  00 to 0 petite in brands such as J.Crew and banana republic for reference and I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù & 107lbs.  Because it is so fitted I had to slide it up higher on my waist making it a miniskirt length. It is tailored really well and does not have too extreme of an A line. Excited to wear this with a turtleneck and some tights and booties this fall and winter the warm wool will be nice for colder temps!"
4.0,"I can't speak for how well this product works as we haven't gotten that far, but the sizing between a small and medium is drastic. The small is almost uncomfortably tight on my skinny 2yo (measures 20in) and the medium is huge. However, the quality is fantastic. No seams and soft. I do wish they offered a more minimal design for little girls. Photo shows both small and medium tanks."
4.0,"This is a soft, stretchy, comfortable shirt made of glittery fabric. The fabric seems to not wrinkle at all, which is nice! My only complaint is that I was expecting it to be more of a solid/thick fabric - when I was unpacking the shirt I immediately noticed I could see light through it. Therefore, I don't want to wear it without a tank top underneath.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was reimbursed for this product by Cashbackbase."
4.0,"So rad, so comfy, so fun!<br />I‚Äôd give this a full 5 stars if the top green felt part was removable for washing"
4.0,I liked the colors and length. They stay in place and do what they're suppose to do.
4.0,Love the top but the sleeves are too short and the seam between the black and the blue sits right on my D cup.
4.0,Very pretty and super comfy. Run huge- I got a medium (5'6 and 140lbs) and it was huge- seemed made for a woman with DD chest. Got it in small and it fits fine but honestly could have probably gotten and extra small but I don't think they offer that. It is so comfortable and pretty!
4.0,Impression short under next aren‚Äôt that tight  but the shorts are of a nice fabric
4.0,"In most brands I‚Äôm either medium or medium/large with an elongated oval head. My head measured 22.5 circumference, which falls right in the middle of the ‚ÄúM‚Äù sizing, but when it arrived it was loose all around the sides and could tilt all the way back and expose my forehead- soo it was too large for me. I‚Äôm a sample size of one, but I‚Äôd advise to go smaller, will look less bulky anyways"
4.0,"Nice,  fit well"
4.0,It's OK. Fits well. breathable OK.  Not bad for the money.
4.0,"Nice quality, but fits small"
4.0,"Cute but cheap. I have an adverse American ear size, I think... And it fits and looks great, but it is cheap fun jewelry."
4.0,But the cases are a pain when trying to insert glasses.
4.0,too long sleeves
4.0,"Great Hat.  Nice material, size is spot on and the Navy is perfect..  Shipping took longer than expected, but it was a great value so well worth it.  May purchase another as  a gift.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,It looks great. Just a little big.
4.0,Definitely size up if you're over 5'5  but overall its super cute
4.0,Nicely made cushion grips.
4.0,"Very nice jacket, well made. It is a bit thicker than I expected."
4.0,Very soft. Wish it was more tapered in the waist at the bottom of the shirt. But I do like it since it‚Äôs very light
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter and she absoutely loves it!  It looks quite stylish on, and is VERY warm."
4.0,"This dress is awesome.  It's light and flowy, and hides trouble spots.<br /><br />I originally purchased this dress in &#34;Blue-1&#34;, which is the blue / orange diamond print.  It's amazing.  Fits fantastic, I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  It shrinks in the wash, which was good for me. After washing, it just skimmed the floor.  (I'm 5'2&#34;, wearing flats).  The material has a slight bit of texture (crepey), and the dress has pockets!<br /><br />I purchased the same dress, different &#34;color&#34; a few months later. (Multicolor black)  It's a beautiful, feminine print.  The dress fit the same, but the material is different (thinner, smoother material), and sadly, no pockets!<br /><br />I'd buy either of these styles again."
4.0,"My daughter loves the colors and that she can transform the robe into a stuffy and vice versa, however she just turned 9, is about 52‚Äù tall and medium built, I ordered the 10-11 year old size for her and it is too small.  She is still wearing it because she loves how soft it is and the colors and everything else about it, but it does not even come together in the front."
4.0,Just didn't like that plastic zipper. But other than that I loved my skirt.
4.0,Fits great! My daughter loves them. Great Quality for price
4.0,"The tape itself is good. It is not the same as weatherstripping found at hardware stores because it is thinner foam tape. If the tape was manufactured with a slight paper edge it would be much better for peeling the paper backing off. I found it frustrating to peel offf the backing. I tried peeling it back with my fingernail with no success. After wasting some of the tape, here‚Äôs what I found out that worked. I took a knife with a thin edge and gently put the knife edge on the corner of the tape and peeled it back easily."
4.0,"This versatile dress is perfect for work or going out. I am 5ft 4 in, size 8, 38D and got the medium. After one washing, it shrank and is now snug in the chest but I will still wear it. If you like to iron, this is the perfect dress for you!"
4.0,Its a nice wallet.  Have not checked the RFID.
4.0,"It's a lot more orange than I though it would be, but I still like it."
4.0,Small. Girlfriend really liked it.
4.0,"Look good, nothing waooo but its OK"
4.0,I really like these earrings! The only reason that I didn't give them a five is because they are very small.
4.0,"I love Pirates of the Caribbean.  My friend has the Aztec coin that Elizabeth Swann wears.  I bought this because it was inexpensive and looked cool.  Notice that I said ""inexpensive."" It's not cheaply made.  It is well-made for the price.  Definitely a good buy if you don't have a lot of cash to spend."
4.0,beautiful. But couple of gems have fallen out.
4.0,THIS DRESS WAS SUPER CUTE!!! BUT I RETURNED IT BECAUSE IT DID NOT FIT MY BODY TYPE WELL. THEY RETURNED IT HASSLE FREE THO SO THAT WAS GREAT.
4.0,"Very nice for the price.  Overall the short material is a bit lighter weight than I expected; but, the price is half of other name brands.  Reasonable padding."
4.0,The upper body and waist didn't match what American sizes would fit as.  Beautiful dress though!
4.0,"Got this for under a sweater vest my husband will be wearing to a funeral. It seems of good quality material to the touch. I do recommend this for those looking for a nice polo shirt. Not thin, but seems breathable."
4.0,I wish they were a little more stretchy. They‚Äôre a little stiff. Still cute though!
4.0,It's cute and slimming but makes your chest look huge because of the way it's cut.  The skirt portion is a little high.
4.0,Band is a little looser after wearing for a month. The band seems to stay secured to the watch though.
4.0,"The item must run small, however the company was quick to satisfy my disappointment."
4.0,Nice shirt but did fit a bit too small.
4.0,"Great shorts; cute pattern, true to size fit."
4.0,"This dress is a fun twist on the classic shirtdress. The tiers and maxi length make it modern. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. It may be slightly sheer in bright light since it is unlined. I found the arms to be a bit tight. I sized up, but the fit from the waist up was way too small. I would have needed another four or five inches to actually button up. If you're a smaller cup size, it shouldn't be a problem. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"This is my third pair of these sunglasses. They look great and do the job of protecting my eyes. Only 4 stars, though, because I keep getting hairline cracks in the frame. Third pair = three strikes and your out. This pair cracks, I move on to a different style and brand. Overall, I love the glasses."
4.0,"pretty, but it's not red. Its pint...still nice"
4.0,"I picked this guy up as a zip-in for my Mammut shell.<br /><br />The fleece is very warm. It is wind-resistant, but not 100% windproof.<br /><br />Be careful with sizing....this piece has an athletic fit for trim people. If you are a big Medium, or pack any muscle you are going to have a tough time fitting into this piece."
4.0,It's not the highest quality but it works well considering it's only $15. I ended up getting the fossil mesh wrist band but this was a good temporary item.
4.0,"I love these pants overall~ they are well made, quality fabric, and Great silhouette.  I only take one star off because the waist is quite small.  I ordered an xs which would be normal for me (typically a 0 or 25/26 in pants) but the waist band is quite small and hard to get over my hips.  I don‚Äôt know if I got an off pair or not but I‚Äôd likely want to go a size up if I ordered again.  The rest of the pant fits great!"
4.0,"The rose gold plating is coming off on the palm side of the ring from wearing it all of the time, but other than that it is adorable and dainty. I get a lot of compliments!"
4.0,They are pretty earrings. Two of the larger earring sets didn't line up or latch correctly to close. That is ok though. I will still get good wear out of the smaller sizes... they are the size I like to wear for everyday wear anyway.
4.0,"For the price, it was a great deal. Really looked like alligator watch band, not cheesey or embossed. Great product."
4.0,"Great quality and my 10 hear old son was happy with my purchase, but ended up to be too small.  I think something longer in the legs would have been more comfortable for him.<br /><br />He is slightly above average height and medium build."
4.0,It's wonderful that these pants come in various lengths. Being able to pick the length I wanted made me very happy.<br />The mocha color is a beautiful golden brown. The pants fit perfectly. I washed them by machine and hung to dry. Had to stretch the fabric across the waistband after washing to get it to lay flat. For rayon the fabric seems quite stiff. Some slight shrinkage after washing. They look great when I wear them.
4.0,The easy it fits and looks.
4.0,"Don't order if you're in a hurry! For the price, it is pretty, but up close looks pretty cheap/"
4.0,"It is a tad too long, but I will keep it and wear appropriate footwear."
4.0,Picture is a cheap iron on.
4.0,"I love how soft the material feels to my skin, it's velvety soft. It's thin and lightweight, great for the summer months. I like the tie dye swirly blue/green/white pattern, it's very soothing. They don't necessarily look like pajamas and I can see myself wearing them around the house during the summer months. They have hidden pockets in the shorts and  real buttons in the top, although I can easily put the top on and take it off without unbuttoning them. They're true to size and they feel comfortable. However, if I could, I would change the elastic band around the waist, it's a little tight and I would prefer it to be looser especially since they're made for sleeping. They held up well in my washer (cold water, delicate cycle) and dryer."
4.0,I‚Äôve had these socks for a year now. I live in the west part of the US and weather  gets to 40F during the winter sometimes even lower and these socks definitely keep my feet warm. I feel very comfortable and haven‚Äôt seen any loose threads. I also wear them with my hiking boots.
4.0,My bridesmaids loved things!
4.0,Great quality. Good and thick. Nice dress for winter. Shipped promptly. Highly recommend!
4.0,The pajama bottoms fit as expected but the top runs small. I like them. I purchased to wear to a sleepover with 3-year old twins who love everything Disney. Really cute jammies.
4.0,Smaller then anticipated.  Rather hard to get credit cards etc. out of slots.
4.0,This product has a nice collie but the item is sewn with a defect. The item does not sit properly. Upon close observation the mega an and body sewing is high and low and uneven.
4.0,"The clear and black ear plugs have a cool look.  I might mention that if you're gauging your ears, have them pierced at a 10 gauge, most shops will do this..  Otherwise it may take much time and patience just to get to an 8g plug from a 16g.  This is a process that must be done carefully and with proper instruction, otherwise you may do permanent damage to your ears.  I would take AT LEAST two weeks to taper one stage.  Most piercing shops advise against tapering on your own, but this way is much cheaper and easier if you know what you're doing.  Nice kit just take caution!"
4.0,"Good denim dress with a good stretch, it does not look loose like that unless you go up 2 sizes. Overall, well made."
4.0,"This really is such a beautiful shirt, unfortunately it didn't look right on me due to my shape. I haven't decided if I should send it back or try to wash it cause that will probably shrink it a bit. I received the item at a discount in exchange for a review. This short would definitely be cute and perfect for a night out, I just love the material"
4.0,Pretty dress and but shorter than usual dresses. My daughter wears it as tunic. But if you are looking for smt unusual you can buy it
4.0,The way they fit and are very pretty
4.0,These necklaces are cute and simple. Well made however the chain is thin so dont expect it to last too long if you choose to wear it everyday.
4.0,Really pretty but the clasp stops working after a day or two. The date is hard to set. Otherwise good product.
4.0,It's very comfortable and super cute! I gave it four instead of five because the top I feel could fit better it's a awkward fit. Otherwise awesome:)<br />5'4.  150.<br />Got a xl
4.0,"Liked that it came with neck chain & keychain option, but took forever to receive the package."
4.0,Love it and it fits good a little small in the bust area but over all good
4.0,"It is a little smaller than I'd expected, but it is a nice shrug and really brings out the dress I wear it with."
4.0,"I bought these earrings for my elderly mother. I was concerned that they might pinch her ears, but they do not. They are very cute, and look more expensive than they are."
4.0,"I love this long top, that I use it for with leggins.  It does not want to cling to anything, hips waist, etc.<br />The flimsy t-shirt material ones are awful about clinging. and no, not from static.  I wear those around the house and to clean."
4.0,Bought for my daughter when we traveled and she likes it.  It is lightweight and convertible as a shoulder bag (for those museums where you can't take a backpack inside). The zipper also opens up all the way down for easy access (unlike the one I bought). A pocket outside or the side for bottles would have been great. The quality is fine for the price.
4.0,"Very cute for an Apple Watch to dress it up.  My watch was spinning a bit and had to keep it a bit tighter, but I like it."
4.0,"My son in law received it for Christmas and his teenage son loved it too.  Possibly he will get one for his birthday.  Nice looking,well made, good fit."
4.0,"The product itself is 5 stars! It's a little heavy for its size, which means it's good quality. It got minus 1 star because it got delivered 1 day late, which ruined the surprise gift. But overall it's a great key chain and a phenomenal symbol of our family's love for aviation!"
4.0,My husband doesn't like it on me.  It is high waisted and he said I look pregnant.  so it would be a very good maternity dress but Im.....well no where near that age anymore!  LOL  I love the pattern and material.
4.0,"I just got these a little bit ago. Right away I loved the feel of them. I tried a pair on and they fit perfectly. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did not get all the colours they showed. I got 3 pr black, 3 pr tan, 1 blue, 1 white, one red, 1 turquoise, one pink and one salmon. I really wanted the purple pair to match the bra I just purchased."
4.0,"I really like these sport loop bands, for me A+<br />but this particular make of band seems to be fraying so if worn daily suspect it will<br />wear out in a year.  Still worth it to me. :-)"
4.0,"Im rather short and these fit like long leggings to my ankle, but loose at the end. Im 5'1. But besides that they're pretty comfy. Im usually a small but they're a tad tight so maybe order a size up if you like looser fitted leggings. They're aren't see through at all and are made of a good material."
4.0,It looks the way it's supposed to. No damage. It's shiny and brand new looking. I love it. It will be a great gift for my friend. Her nickname is Panda. So it's perfect
4.0,I am on my feet a lot and looked for a flip flop with lots of padding on the sole. This one is good and allows me to be on my feet and never feel sore.
4.0,"Very cute earrings! The only problem are the hoop set. They are pretty difficult to connect back together whether doing it from the front, back or even when just holding them in front of you. I just don't use them because of that.  Love the other two though!"
4.0,pretty and affordable.  my fat wrists made the stones separate so i returned it.  If you are normal size wrist then i will look fab!
4.0,"Nice swimming suit.I usually wear size 14, so ordered 14-16. Fits well.Flatering, but don't expect too much tummy control, because the material is tin.Upper part is very pretty. I wish halter was available with this specific style I bought. The stripes are very tin and don't like them too much, they don't provide enough support.  Good for the money and multicolored bustier looks really attractive. Like it overall."
4.0,Solidly built. A bit while to the cheekbone.
4.0,I love them. :) just what I wanted. I need some more like this in a variety of color in a pack at a good price.
4.0,Great look although material is not the best quality. Got compliments. Ordered medium in grey.
4.0,Went to party city and they wigs of lesser quality were 20 dollars. This wig is great! Gets tangled easily and is a little thin is areas but for 10 dollars 100% worth it.
4.0,"Not much to review, came as promised, quality item"
4.0,Cute dress. Flannel is a little stiff
4.0,I do not like plastic backs.
4.0,"First off these boots appear well made and am sad I'm returning them. My girl said they fit, a tad big but I ordered a size large. There are two reasons why  we are returning them for a refund. 1) the pictures  and description  omits the fact they have a  zipper on the infacing  side of the boot. For us it was a deal breaker.<br />2) the boot doesn't come up to mid calf, we needed a taller boot.<br />Other than that I was pleased with what appears to b a well made kids work boot.<br /><br />Update: never did return these boots as Iplanned. Instead my daughter ,who is a farm kid, wore them 4 months and is putting them back on for this summer. They,in my opinion,  are holding up fairly well, though  she is pretty good with taking care of things. She says they dont hurt her feet so that's a plus and water and mud resistance (not proof) is also nice. Pics are from after 4 months  daily wear."
4.0,I bought the largest size and it didn't fit.  But it fit my neighbor quite well and she looks just darling in it.  Go up 2 sizes and you should be fine
4.0,"These are very comfortable, just with my stage in pregnancy my belly is big and the shorts appear shorter. I am 32 weeks, 5 foot and all baby."
4.0,For the price point they are so much fun to match to your clothes!!!
4.0,We used for a fireworks display and they seemed to work well. I'm just not sure how effective they truly are. My son could still hear me while talking to him with them on. Still better than nothing.
4.0,Great for the 6 year old!
4.0,"I loved the fabric and the color was just as pictured. It was slightly smaller than I am used to, so would suggest going a size up if you don't like things super tight. The style is flattering and is a nice zip and go dress."
4.0,Our 4 year old has ALWAYS had a big head so I should‚Äôve known better that these would just about fit. I‚Äôd give them 5 stars if they were slightly adjustable. I knew they weren‚Äôt before I purchased but I was hoping for some leeway.  Ready for Moster Trucks!!
4.0,The pjs were warm and comfy but a little big for the size I ordered. My grandson loved them.
4.0,"I like the top so far - I received it about a week ago and have worn it twice. It's a little bigger than I would have liked it, but not so big that I'm swimming in it. I'm about 5'6&#34;, 140 lbs and ordered a large; probably could have gotten away with a medium. Otherwise I'm pretty happy with the top. The material looks and feels nicer than I expected. I read one review that said it started pilling right away after washing, so we'll see what happens when I wash mine. I typically hang-dry shirts like this, so hopefully mine won't pill as quickly. Would I order again? Yeah, probably. I seem to have an addiction to multicolored patterned leggings, and I bought this shirt to wear with those. I would probably order one in another color that could also be worn with my leggings. Overall, not bad quality for what I paid!"
4.0,The dress is pretty and comfortable.  The sizing is a bit off. I wear a large and it is a tad bit smaller than a large but<br />not smaller enough to say it's medium.
4.0,The top on this outfit is very cute but the bloomers are VERY large. My granddaughter can not wear them.
4.0,Cute shirt. bought a size bigger. Cut the pockets of though. They were in a very awkward place. Looks good now!
4.0,this shirt looks great on the hanger the design is nice and simple so it will go with just about anything and is long enough to be worn with leggings the material looks and feels nice and it wears well the only problem is that it is see thru so you can adjust your bra color but with it so long you will not want to tuck it in but you will be able to see what ever color of bottoms you are wearing thru the shirt so makes it look no so professional
4.0,I liked this. It can be paired with something or worn alone. Fits as expected and can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"It annoys me when products like this are listed ""for men."" Of course anyone can wear these--it just depends on your personal tastes and style. I like the look of these, with their black spikes, and I also like that they're on the small side. They're a comfortable weight, and I find the clasp easy to deal with. I do have some issue with the post, however. It's curved, which makes it difficult to put these on since my piercings are in a thick part of my ear."
4.0,Would have given watch five stars but watch is not Rose Gold as described. It is a beautiful watch and it looks just like the picture. I just thought my screen made it look darker than Rose Gold but no watch is more of a dark copper look. But pretty none the less and very well made.
4.0,Great watch for the price. 6 mo. and still working.
4.0,I brought for my son and he like it
4.0,The dress fit as expected but it did not come with a belt as pictured and as listed. I added some red flowers since my daughter was wearing it to her 5th grade Valentines dance. She loved the dress and said it was very comfortable . I would buy another one in a different color.
4.0,Fit as expected and its nice. I am looking forward to wearing it.
4.0,"The outfit I got was exactly what you see in the picture! However, it runs small.. I knew that so I ordered up a size. I'm about 145lbs and 5'8... Trust me when I say, if you're anything around that size, order an extra large. If you are tall or have a long torso order an X-large!! Otherwise you will be walking around with a cooter wedgie... Not hot ladies.. Had I gotten an X-large I would have been good to go..."
4.0,This product runs large and is stretchy so size down.
4.0,"It was smaller than I thought it would be. Also resembled ALF more than a pig. But it creeped my students out, so it was worth the money!"
4.0,"The band was for my husband.  He likes it, it fits well and he's happy with it so far."
4.0,"Great Turtle necklace, love the size & two tone silver"
4.0,"I ordered an extra large (I'm a large) to be a little baggy, but it's definitely a dress on me. I suggest ordering in your true size for a baggy comfortable feel/fit."
4.0,"Can't really go wrong with basic silicone tunnels. These arrived pretty quickly and fit and look as expected. I love silicone plugs because they seem to be the most hygienic option for stretched ears. Only giving 4 stars due to the price... Why are 2 little pieces of silicone over $8 with shipping? Seems too expensive, but all other similar options are the same price if not more."
4.0,Nice product for the money. Would purchase again!!!!!!!
4.0,Nice earrings if you like big earrings
4.0,Beautiful blouse but very small. I never wear a large and I had to returned item.
4.0,The jacket is well made and warm. My only complaint is that there is no collar clasp of any sort and the wrists could be tighter when they're zipped.
4.0,My granddaughter likes the fun prints on these!
4.0,"The title for this bag is a bit misleading.  It will not hold a 17"" laptop.  I bought this bag for my husband to carry his 15.4 inch laptop (screen size measured diagonally).  The bag is designed to hold a 14"" laptop.  My bad - I did not fully read the description.  This bag will hold the 15.4 inch laptop but not in the padded slot designated for the laptop.  This is a very nice bag, and can be used as designed as long as the laptop is no larger than 14 inches."
4.0,Very light and airy
4.0,Didn't like the color too much but other than that I liked the top.
4.0,Ordered these to keep my feet off the gym shower floors. Work like a charm! The water goes right through the holes and I don't have any issues slipping. Also pretty soft/comfortable for shower sandals. There very spongy but somehow dry almost completely within 10 mins after showering. A quick shake off and I can toss them right back into my gym bag without worrying about wetting the inside.<br /><br />Only con is the size is a little smaller than expected and the loop is a little too wide. My feet stay in place but I would have liked a tighter fit.
4.0,"Great hat! My daughter loved it! The only problem was that it only came with one braid. My daughter noticed that first off. Easy fix though, I just I braided and re-did it with two braids."
4.0,Bought as a gift.  Daughter's friend loves it and wears it every day.
4.0,The white tag on the side is unraveling but it is very warm. The white strings are way too thick and obnoxious
4.0,"I liked them, they sure protect your eyes while providing a pleasant color vision. Very please with the purchase."
4.0,"It is ok, fits just fine."
4.0,"Beautiful dress and color, just too small for me.  My first purchase so I will learn to look at size charts better."
4.0,"The cut is a little boxy for a little girl, but the shirts are cute and the fabric is decently thick. I have no doubt they will last. There may be a stray string or two, but  those take a second to snip off, and they're just finished seams that weren't trimmed close enough. The shirts aren't falling apart. And at $5.50 per shirt, I definitely can't complain! I ordered the 5T, and would say they run about one size large."
4.0,"THESE ARE VERY PRETTY AND A GOOD DEAL. MY ONE COMPLAINT IS THAT THE CHAIN CONNECTS TO THE HOOK, THAT WILL REST IN YOUR PIERCING, AT A SLIGHT ANGLE SO AT TIMES I'VE HAD A LITTLE DIFICULTY GETTING THAT CONNECTION THROUGH MY PIERCING WHICH CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE. OTHER THAN THAT I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH, ONCE IN THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE."
4.0,Great watch but my husband needed one that showed the month and year without having to punch a button.
4.0,"Nice material, solid construction. Sizing was a bit small."
4.0,"The product was listed as the color ""nude"" I didn't receive this color. Both pairs I received were a maroon color. The fit was great, but they need to update their product facts."
4.0,"Looks as pictured, adorable for the winter season, just much smaller than I imagined. There wasn't really a size comparison on the listing so I had no idea until they arrived. Still looks great, just very small. Size would even be suitable for little girls ears."
4.0,"Adorable and very easy to break in!  Normally this style of shoe rubs at the back of my ankle because of the low-rise design, but these broke in right away with no blisters.  My only complaint is that they stain very very easily.  I sprayed a water-resistant product on mine, but the toes are already dirty."
4.0,"This dress is very well made with a good amount of stretch to the fabric. I ordered a 2x and it fit perfectly. I like the lace sleeves , it adds a touch of sexiness to the outfit. I think this dress is great."
4.0,I put on two and cut off the extra chain hanging on the side. Almost a week later I‚Äôm still wearing the same two. They didn‚Äôt get ruined in the shower. If you take them off everyday they‚Äôll probably last longer. Each one came in its own plastic bag. Can be used as a bracelet
4.0,Need 10mm. This is a thin size but nice
4.0,"Very pretty and well made. However, I thought it was a little too small for me, so I will use this purse on occasion or maybe, give it away as a gift for my younger niece."
4.0,It is very nice to wear and see and also very soft! It fits perfectly on my Hamilton.just the inner part could look a little better
4.0,These socks were exactly what I was looking for!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b2c4c019214d14812179946fb249b162]] For the price I‚Äôm very disappointed. This product doesn‚Äôt give what it supposed to give. Especially for the price i paid. I‚Äôm sad . I really was looking forward to wearing it
4.0,Umbrella is handy -- we tossed the plastic case.  The idea is for a travel umbrella to be small but the case makes it bigger and bulkier.
4.0,"These are pretty great.  Tested one out at my Yoga class last night and was very happy w/ the comfort level.<br /><br />Note that I am a 34B, so, keeping my &#34;girls&#34; in check is a lot easier than it is for some larger breasted Women. If you are a C cup or larger, I would not suggest these for Running or Cross Fit.  While supportive and extremely comfortable, they are thin, looser fitting and probably would not offer the support needed during vigorous movement.  I'll use them for Yoga and my basic work out routine, but for the more intense workouts, I'm gonna stick with my Champion Sports Bra.<br /><br />The comfort alone is worth the price.  And, if you are someone who is getting away from underwires, these would work for most outfits, as they are handsomely low cut :)  I love them.  Just think they could be a *tad* more fitted and firm."
4.0,I love them but I thought I ORDERED THEM with led LIGHTS
4.0,"The fit was nice. The material is heavy but breathable. At the end of the day the zipper got stuck at the very top. However, I would buy it again in a different color."
4.0,"Love the fabric, more navy than black. Looks nice"
4.0,Great sleep shirt...got one for my goddaughter too!
4.0,"I think this grounding strap is a great concept, however I didn't realize that it stays in place with adhesive. I didn't want to adhere them to my shoes, so I decided to return them."
4.0,I liked it but the zipper stiching started to come apart. Not the best of quality
4.0,I like this Black Cat Necklace watch and would have given it 5 stars but it is NOT Glow in the Dark at all!
4.0,The pants run big and the jacket runs small! Order 1 size up. The reactions to this suit are Fantastic! People love the patterns and the additional lights are a great conversation starter!
4.0,"Just wish you could get them in black, so the dirt wouldn't show so badly."
4.0,lil to big for him but it is a very good quality shirt
4.0,"This is a nice, lightweight fabric.  But the the printed words looked double stamped.  A bit messy but maybe it‚Äôs supposed to look that way?  Like what you see before the coffee?  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôm keeping it, it‚Äôs funny!  True to size."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ab1c5c5a837c2c916d917e1f92fd291f]] Very pretty, smaller than the picture but Sunflower is my favorite flower, so it's something I will be wearing alot of.<br />Fits perfect ü•∞"
4.0,"I love this watch. I had to remove a link because I have a skinny wrist, but at least I had that option.<br />It's stylish and elegant. The box it came in was nicely packaged.<br />The instructions on how to remove a link are in very poor English, which elicited laughter while working on it.<br />It'd make a great gift for anyone."
4.0,"Very cute, decent made socks. The Thomas images were clear and they seem to wash up okay. They are a bit small compared to the same size in other brands. Overall I had a happy niece!"
4.0,"Skirt length is generous, great if you are tall.  3/4 sleeves are slightly shorter than picture.  I would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer.  Fabric is a nice weight.  Not at all see-through.  5‚Äô10‚Äù, 210lb, 36E"
4.0,"While I had to return this item because it was too small,(thus, the 4 stars instead of 5) the quality of it was very good. The seller and I had to negotiate the terms of the return, and the seller made good and was very responsive. I wanted to make sure that I posted my satisfaction with their customer service."
4.0,It's to loose on my head. But I love the hat
4.0,The slip is a little too short for the dress.
4.0,I like the build and they seem pretty tough for being so cheap. The wood arms are pretty cool too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the tint is way too dark. Even in full sunlight it is a bit tough to see.
4.0,The color was somewhat off from the pictures.  I expected a more yellow shirt.
4.0,Second pair that we brought for the little one they are cute I just wish that the insole didn't come out so easily & that they came with washing instructions
4.0,Cute! Definitely the standard thickness fit maxi dresses. Not a super high quality dress but it gets the job done for the price. Love the color and very comfy. Definitely need a skip to make it thicker material on your behind
4.0,They were of a nice quality but so long it kept slipping backwards or forward.  Kind of loose
4.0,They work and for the right price.
4.0,The zippers get stuck - but over all love it
4.0,"This band is slightly smaller than the larger band that comes with the Gear S2, but works fine as a replacement band for it.  I use to put the pin in hole 3 or 4 of the original band, but I have to use hole 2 from the end for this one."
4.0,lots of pressure on the nose but can breathe easy
4.0,Got these for my son. He can be rough on shoes. They have held up pretty well.
4.0,"The wrist band is very comfortable. It has lasted a long time. The design wore off pretty quickly, but it still looks good without the white stripes."
4.0,"Not as long as I would have hoped. Pretty, but fits off due to not being long enough."
4.0,"I liked the color and convenience of 2 pockets,.  This feature was not in the description."
4.0,"So, the order took about a month to get to me not surprising since it came from China. Now I was having some issue with it staying on my face as the previous reviewer said they are a bit loose on an adult female face. folding it over seems to help somewhat.<br /><br />To the person who asked on Amazon.com what material they are made out of, the 3rd pic says high end elastic and Ice Silk material. To me though it feels like polyester. They also do not have any tags inside of them.<br />Apparently, if you buy something via Amazon Smile you cannot reply to things on Amazon.com."
4.0,"warm, and comfortable"
4.0,"The chains pretty weak, but the necklace overall is really cute."
4.0,"Dress pant yoga pants are now the only dress pants I will buy. These are great: professional looking; super comfortable; a nice, thick material. The only downside is they are comically long (WHO is that tall???). I will just get them hemmed, because they are worth it. Still annoying."
4.0,Pretty. The flower doesn't lay very nice on your neck though.
4.0,I wore them for a week straight. No greenish tinge. Actually my ears didn't puff up as they usually do. I have my ear lobes double piecered. I usually use surgical steel and they always become irritated and puff up whenever I decide I want earrings back in. (Sometimes I will go months to a year without having earrings in) But with these I had no problem.<br /><br />Great price for how many pairs you get. I have not had trouble with gems falling out so far.
4.0,"Shorts don't seem to be loose but I like them being a little skimpy for bed. The top lace is too much, cut the top pieces off and it looks way better. Super comfy and might buy in another color because it looks so good."
4.0,I love how comfy the shoes are and have gotten compliments on them.  My only complaint is they squeak on tile floors which is something I really dislike.
4.0,Good quality. Only con...It didn't come in time for my company Christmas party.
4.0,It came way way sooner than it said and it‚Äôs so cute but the picture is already chipping off on the corners
4.0,Fits good. Quality as expected.
4.0,"Besides the arm holes sagging pretty low and showing the sides of my bra... and receiving the wrong color... and the material being pretty cheap... it's actually not that bad. Accessorized properly, it creates an elegant, simple look that's lovely for work and the elastic bad is well placed. I debated sending it back, but my husband persuaded me to keep it. Not worth $24, but certainly nice to have for variety if you have an office job."
4.0,Such a fun flowy dress. Fit as expected. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because I shrunk after I washed it. The size was fine but the length went above the knee...before it was slightly below the knee. I‚Äôm just afraid it will shrink again after I wash it again. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù.
4.0,"lovely, no complaints."
4.0,"Love the color and it's the perfect size. Only thing I don't care for is the lining. The liner is very loose, it's also not attached to anything other than along the top and the extra material is constantly getting caught in the zipper. Also tends to come out when I pull out my wallet. The inside pockets are made out of the liner and are hard to use because the liner moves around a lot since it's so loose and not attacked. I wish the liner was a little smaller and more firmly attached to the bag itself. I love the extra outside pockets as it makes it so easy to organize."
4.0,Nice quality authentic tour merchandise. Great embroidery on back with 2016 tour on each sleeve. Definitely men‚Äôs sizing. I bought medium size and can fit a hoodie under comfortably. Nice for any collector.
4.0,"Beautiful, but silver is already turning copper like where it touches my skin after only one week of wear. Sent me two chains, pearls, and the cage. Thought it was supposed to be 925, but there is no stamp, an d like I said, it's already turning copper like where it touches my skin. It was larger than I thought but love how it sits perfectly everytime."
4.0,It was a little long. I wish they had a petite option.
4.0,"This are great quality sweat warm up pants!<br />The vinyl seemed a little on the thick side,but got somewhat better when warmed up by body heat.<br />The size s run on the big side...........<br />I am 5'4"", 160 pounds 31"" waist 40"" hips and the size medium was on the big side,so i ordered a size small.........<br />They fit perfect!!!!!<br />And look great with the waist rolled down twice!"
4.0,"A bit tight, but overall good quality."
4.0,"I like these very much. However, they should include a mix of sizes so that you can comfortably wear them on each finger. They're all the same size."
4.0,It might be the ‚ÄúCovid-19‚Äù I ve gained (not really)  but it s probably an extra few but this seems to be a bit skimpy  Gown is fine but robe is not as roomy. Fabric is quite nice. Extra design details are appreciated
4.0,Really Cute boots but the smell was awful!!  I let them sit in a closet for 6 mo-year and now they are great!
4.0,My ears are not identical heights - so not a perfect fit. But that's just me. Good for biking and driving.
4.0,"Very fun hat, was a little small though, runs a little tight"
4.0,Fits nicely in my wallet....hope it works
4.0,Wife very pleased with it nice size easy to used
4.0,Too loose....one size does not fit all.
4.0,Looks nice and my girls like them. The chain is not the best quality and I will be replacing the chains.
4.0,"There are a lot of nice blouses, but this one is one of the more nicer and flowy ones. Four stars only because I still need to iron it. Yes, I'm a little lazy.<br />The compliments I received made me love it more!"
4.0,love it but little small
4.0,"I'll only wear them as leggings UNDER something else.  They add a big of ""hug me"" support to legs which is nice."
4.0,"Expensive, but the right color and quality we were looking for"
4.0,"Product arrived timely and safely. This is my third sweater of this type. I have pink and green as well. I find these sweaters to fit as expected and nice & soft. I love the feathered pattern in the design as this makes it different than the many typical crew neck sweaters I own. I would call this a light to medium weight sweater. My other two have laundered well with only light shedding (machine wash cold, delicate and drying flat.) I did take off a star bc unlike my pink and green, the color isn‚Äôt as described. This sweater is not actually white but a nude based ivory/off white. Not worth returning imo for this reason, but worth noting for those expecting true white color."
4.0,Loved the coat just wish it ad a hat
4.0,"Super Cute! It is exactly as the stock photo shows. Had to set up my watch to get it ticking. Easy to navigate the watch. I do have a warning that the face of the watch too up a good chunk of the front of my arm. I was surprised because I thought it would be more dainty looking.

4.0,"Looks good, super wrinkly"
4.0,"easy to use, makes shaving slightly awkward but does catch hair as you shave, folding it up isn‚Äôt as easy as I would hope but very useful to minimize hair getting all over the bathroom sink."
4.0,Bought for my mom she hasn‚Äôt complained about it yet
4.0,"They are cheap but I knew that when I bought them. One of them was broken upon arrival so I just threw that out, they‚Äôre cute enough though, I‚Äôm wearing one now and have already received a couple compliments."
4.0,"A little smaller than hoped, bit I still love it. If anyone was wondering, you can pop off the back like a wristwatch, there's a groove on the bottom."
4.0,Luv it. Truly Luvp
4.0,Perfect dress for the spring
4.0,These are decent socks for the money however they are a bit thin and very slippery until you've washed them a couple times so be careful that you don't find yourself in a hurry on a tile or linoleum floor. Lol
4.0,does knock down glare from headlights but does darken the overall view
4.0,Fit and looks exactly as shown and described
4.0,Lots of compliments. I'm 5'7 140 pounds and ordered a size small. The material is nice and it's pretty fitted so if you want a looser look order up one size.
4.0,So I get the Casio for my brother on Christmas and he loved it especially after I told him people made bombs with them.<br />Just surprised everyone that it was so small and thin.
4.0,"for the 9 dollars and getting 36 pairs of earrings, you really can't complain! was just what I was looking for ! love them !"
4.0,"I Liked them just the only problem with the two pair I bought was the rear was a bit low in both pairs. Great price for both, just over $35."
4.0,It's very thick and will be great during the winter!! I also love the hood !!
4.0,Love the I‚Äôd holder.  The lanyard could be longer.
4.0,Looks super cute and comfy. Got for a friend and she loved it
4.0,"I like the material,  I like how it fits the bra band , but Did NOT fit the cup size am 36E/F the cup is smaller I got a L size. I Just wondering if the Xl will be good fit or to big from the band size."
4.0,"This suit is beautiful. It has a flattering cut, good length, and looks exactly as described. Two things kept me from a 5 star review. One, I felt it ran big. I got a size up from my normal size, as I do with all swimsuits, and it was bigger than I expected. The bigger issue is that I could hear some threads pop when I tried it on. It's definitely not too small, so time will tell if it holds up. A good buy, in any event."
4.0,"Clean and comfortable, fit large"
4.0,Help the shirt stay tucked in and seem like they'll last a long time. You can definitely feel that you are wearing them but they are not uncomfortable at all.
4.0,"It‚Äôs ok..Compared to a lot of Amazon stuff this is for sure like the picture. The sizing is good I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 125, with 27‚Äù waist and I got a small and it fit perfect. I‚Äôm just not in love with it, the skirt part is more poofy than I thought and the chest is baggy( other reviews said the same thing so I guess it‚Äôs the style) The chest looks loose in the photo but in person it‚Äôs open loose where you‚Äôd need to sew it or put a cami under. I think it‚Äôs a nice dress maybe it‚Äôs just not for me. If it‚Äôs a matter of being worried about hits and misses on Amazon then don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs a decent dress."
4.0,Cute and cozy! Love the design and the fit. Exactly as depicted in the photos.
4.0,"Very cute dress, but is a little small and a little short.  I am only 5'1&#34; and it hits me right at my feet, so I will have to wear flats and won't be able to wear wedges.  But it is still a keeper and very comfy."
4.0,yes. its amazing. i liked it
4.0,I did not like the color‚Ä¶ thought it was a darker green
4.0,My son loves them. Very soft and warm on the inside.
4.0,I love everything about the bag. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the longer shoulder strap is very thin. I would have much preferred that the long shoulder strap is as wide as the shorter strap
4.0,Daughter and friends loved these party hates however a pain to put together
4.0,"Purchased last minute for a Sunday brunch. It‚Äôs nice as I couldn‚Äôt expect much for the price. My only complaint is the string used at the straps and how you lace it up. It‚Äôs cheap, doesn‚Äôt do a great job. A shoe lace would work better lol. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 130ish lbs my measurements are 36‚Äù bust 27‚Äù waist 38.5‚Äù hips. I carry most weight in my legs and am a consistent 32C bra size. This was large in the breast area."
4.0,"Our only complaint was how bad the item smelled, but it was fine after we threw it in the wash!"
4.0,Cute silly glasses gave as a gift
4.0,very cute to wear with shorts!
4.0,"Bottoms fit great , good quality, top too small but I‚Äôm a 38DD"
4.0,"Overall I liked it. Not a fan of the padded bra area. Most items that have padding, usually have the small hole that allows you to remove the padding if you choose to, this swimsuit did not have that option. I probably could have gone a size smaller but did not have time before my trip to process a new order and get it before I had to leave. I was able to wear it as a sun dress at the resort because the skirt was so long on me and got several compliments."
4.0,"The quality isn‚Äôt as good as The original crocs jibbitz (they‚Äôre a little thin and flimsy), but for the amount you get for the price they‚Äôre amazing."
4.0,"Good quality construction for the price. Fit is good. I thought it would look good on my rather large head, but I don't like the way it looks on me - at least for now. I also bought a small-brim fedora which I like much better. I will keep this porkpie as it may grow on me over time."
4.0,"I was a little disappointed in the stitching on the hat (a gift for my brother), but the fit and style of the hat was exactly what my brother likes so he was pleased.  Received quickly via Prime."
4.0,Very warm and looks great too...i get compliments all the time
4.0,"These shorts are very nice looking, the style is relaxed but neat looking.  The workmanship is good, and the turquoise is quite attractive.  The only problem is that they run small, so I cannot actually wear them.  Size up."
4.0,"If you've had problems keeping your neck gaiter in place, the ear holes sewn into the side seams on this will remedy that.<br />If the mask is too tight, try turning it around, as I've found that the seams aren't perfectly centered.<br />The fabric is not as stretchy as other gaiters I've had, but still comfortable to wear."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5f33b3dfb4ac64a1fc17728d6a73b31a]] This Zeagoo 2-piece cotton linen Women‚Äôs Outfit is really cute. You can dress this outfit up with some cute sandals and jewelry - perfect for wearing to dinner or shopping or you can dress it down with tennis shoes for every day wear. This is made from 100% cotton and is washable. However, I would definitely hang to dry to keep it from shrinking. Just be prepared to iron or have to steam this outfit because it is made from cotton. The material is very thin, but not see-through. This has a drawstring waist and two side pockets on the shorts. This fits true to size. You can wear the shirt tucked in or out and it looks cute both ways. This is a great outfit for summertime! Overall, I would recommend this outfit to others. See my video and pictures for details. Thank you for reading, my honest and objective review."
4.0,"I always wear a straight size 8 medium shoe. That's what I ordered. These do not fit. Toes are jamming into the front. Other than that, they are lovely. Very pretty."
4.0,"Darling, good qualit except fades quicky"
4.0,not as long as i expected but it was still a hit at anime boston!!<br />being one of 3 spirit albarn's and the only gender bent (female) one
4.0,"I really like this watch, easy read and good looking. At first little hard to set and attach to wrist but once it is set properly it is easy to put on and off."
4.0,"So far so good, just got them though"
4.0,"The jump rings were a little loose so it fell off the first time I put it on, but I tightened them and it's my new favorite bracelet!"
4.0,The dress is pretty the material seems a little cheap thought but I still like the fit
4.0,They are comfortable and Bett light weight only issue with this order is that I'm missing a few were i got one but not the other
4.0,"Comfortable, gold washes off"
4.0,"stick with the white skeleton for realistic look, also a long torso needed<br />I am 5'4 120 , got a medium for comfort but way to baggy in torso, small might have worked better in body fit  but I was still too short to match up the bones and it looked dumb, didn't wear. otherwise quality is good material etc."
4.0,The dress wil need to be altered but overall I like it. I ordered medium because my waist is small and hips are wide. But a small would‚Äôve worked just fine l. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 1/2 155
4.0,"Feels good, looks good"
4.0,"I have a long torso, so was shorter than I like, but so cute that I'm keeping it."
4.0,The texture is almost like waffle-like prints on the leggings which is nice for curves and flattering. I like that the sports bra is long and pants high waisted. The suching on the rear flattering and creates curves as well
4.0,The only complaint I have is that I purchased these specifically for ball replacement and they didn‚Äôt fit as well as I needed (too big). Other than that the shipping was fast and it‚Äôs a quality metal.
4.0,Top true to size. Bottom a bit big in waist and has less coverage. Love love the top. Would buy again.
4.0,Really cute and different
4.0,product made of durable material.  appears like product photo.
4.0,"These are beautiful and fooled my friend that they were the designer version she and I had oggeled at the designer's shop in the Galeria. However, I find the posts to be a bit larger than typical posts. Not uncomfortable, but worth noting that I could not use replacement backs I had that keep an earring sturdier on my lobe."
4.0,I love it.  The only thing that could be improved is the bow tie can slide out of the loop.  My son loves to pull it out he is 1(so this may not be an issue with older Child!
4.0,"Shades are weird, which is cool. You don't see shades like this everyday, and will definately get compliments. Unfortunately, I received the wrong color in my order. Customer service wasn't extremely helpful, but I kept the shades for the novelty. Would be a great gift for people who like to stand out."
4.0,"The sweat shirt is super cute. I ordered a medium and it fits, but it not as giving as a normal sweat shirt, so I think I'm going to exchange it for a larger size."
4.0,Wish they had more variety on colors. Also tired of them ONLY ever having sale prices for the small sizes. 2xl deserves deals too
4.0,Fits great! Got a lg. I wear a 36c
4.0,"This is a very beautiful gown. It definitely needed to be ironed on a high setting (which I did successfully, without burning the fabric). The important thing to know is that you will most definitely need an adequate slip dress, as it is extremely see through, I wore one and could see the lace trim of the slip through the material. It is worth it, though, I got many compliments on it at the wedding I went to."
4.0,Lovely p
4.0,They are so soft and fit nicely!
4.0,"This was a lovely women's fiction love story. I enjoyed the realistic nature of the storyline and the setting. Even though it was set in Australia I thought the concept could've taken place anywhere because the conflicts and emotions were so universal to anyone who's longed for a second chance at love. Most of all, I'm a sucker for any story that has animals and Ms. Spencer let us enjoy the characters and the relationship she shared with her animals."
4.0,Awesome looking workout top. Fits true to size but the wrist area is just a little baggy. Matches the Aoxjox Arise leggings.
4.0,"It's a nice dress, the material is nice. The only reason I returned is because it's a little bit tight on my"
4.0,"This looks in person EXACTLY like the photo! I have a small wrist and the band adjusted to fit. It appears to the eye to be very high quality. The colors are true and so well designed. I love the little bangles and they hand perfectly. The only thing I am slightly disappointed in is the quality of the leather. It seems a little &#34;light&#34; but still well made . . . just hope the band holds up. But . . . even with that small disappointment, I am so impressed with this watch. It makes me smile . . . what more can I ask for!"
4.0,Very lovely but a little small.
4.0,"Thought they might be a little bigger, but they will be ok. Like the material and colors!"
4.0,Like  it
4.0,I love love love these! The ONLY thing I didnt like was they dont have back pockets.
4.0,Personally would probably like the long brief better
4.0,The tan is a yellowish tan and didn‚Äôt match my neutral tan shoes as intended but I like the sock and fit so I will keep them.  Just not flesh colored or oatmeal tan as expected.
4.0,These are a good length and pretty light.  The only thing I didn't like is that I had to twist them a bit to make the wings left and right.  I hate to do operations on new jewelry but it was a pretty quick fix. Hopefully I didn't screw them up or weaken the links.
4.0,Fun little present for moms
4.0,great variety in the package- some of the plugs didn't have as consistent of a pattern as I had hoped
4.0,Runs A little large
4.0,"Love this dress, I will be buying in other colors."
4.0,"I love the colors, quality was good just ran very small"
4.0,"I really like this dress. The sizing was wrong, I believe.  I had to have it altered considerably, but for the price it was worth it."
4.0,Scallop cuts are well defined. Material is thin but works well for summer or under blazers. Would buy more.
4.0,"The chain is definitely long enough and nice enough quality that, despite wearing it consistently since buying it, I haven't had any problems with it.<br /><br />However, the charm was much smaller than I was expecting as I pictured it more the size of The Haitian's or Peter Petrelli's necklace. In reality, the length from top to bottom is about the diameter of a quarter.<br /><br />Other than that, it's well made and durable but I probably would have gone for a larger one if I were to buy it again."
4.0,I bought the earrings for my daughter. She loves them. They are very small but classy. They are easy to pull off .
4.0,I like them . But I wish they had some color to show more detail. Like maybe colored eyes. They're made very well they're good-sized they're not heavy to wear and for the cost they're good.
4.0,Cute top. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Looks nicer quality than it actually is.
4.0,Not my best bennie but looks good enough.
4.0,Seems to work just fine.  Chest band is old tech.  Settings are not intuitive.  Training info provided with the watch would be very helpful to someone just beginning a serious exercise program.  It would help prevent damaging over-training and time wasting under-training.
4.0,"Looks great. It fell off immediately, but was easy to put back on with some needle nose plyers."
4.0,"This is the classic Casio watch. It‚Äôs what you need when you don‚Äôt feel like paying out the nose for a watch. It‚Äôs alarm and stopwatch functions are great. The watch has only two things I have a quip with. First, the display light is dim and lights up about half the screen in low light. It would have to be in complete darkness to read it easily. Second, the strap is called ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs Standard.‚Äù I‚Äôm a really tall guy with large wrists, so standard watch sizes usually run small for me. This thing was pretty tight for a ‚Äústandard‚Äù strap size. All in all, it‚Äôs a good watch. 4 stars from me because I can‚Äôt fully fault the strap sizing."
4.0,"I thought these would be more cottony than satiny. Must have missed that in the item details but otherwise, they're super cool. The paint does wear off so you'll be covered in little silver shiny particles. It doesn't come off in flecks though, just like, if you brush your hand over the skulls it'll come away with some glitter on it? But it isn't glittery. More metallic than anything. Just buy them, they're comfy and they look badass."
4.0,"These are awesome.  Color is very represented well in the photo - yes, it is that gold. When I put my hair tie in the groove, it is easy to slide into place."
4.0,I thot the lenses were a bit darker but they are cute. The bow didn't stay in place but I got it too work
4.0,Genial. Mejor que la foto.
4.0,Love the suit but it was too short for my torso. Needed it to be just a little bit longer
4.0,Great band - get many compliments!
4.0,"Cute, fits true to size.  The flowers fell off immediately, even before she put it on."
4.0,"Although the material is a little thin and the small actually fits me as if it was an x-small, the cardigan has a nice overall design. The wine colour that I received was duller than in the picture."
4.0,The design on the wallet is so cute and matches the purse really well.  The quality of material makes it seem like it will be very durable.  Plenty of room for credit cards.  My only negative comment would be the change purse portion is a little tight and it isn't really easy to see and access your coins.
4.0,"Lovely dress, but the L didn't fit my shoulders and the arm holes were very narrow and tight. Everywhere else fit fine, and the length was just at my knees. The fabric has no stretch or give, so I had to return it. I'm going to try an XL and hope that fits better. I'm 5'1"", 160 lbs, 38B."
4.0,Pants near ankle area was really loose. Thanks god I own a sew machine.
4.0,Looked for something to add to my shirts that are too low cut for work. Great Designs and sturdy
4.0,Brim wide enough to protect your face from the sun. Lightweight but sturdy.
4.0,The fabric is nice still wear them
4.0,They came perfectly wrapped and were exactly what was described.  The only thing was the fact it came with two very girlish colors.  Other than that  Very Happy the purchase
4.0,"I love it. However, it gets scratched up pretty easily. Other than that, I use this daily to work and I think I'll be purchasing a bigger one."
4.0,"This necklace has the effect of three necklaces in one, so it's a real value for the money. The metals do feel just a tad flimsy so I am skeptical about this lasting over time but for the time being it's a great addition to my gold collection and will go great with fall colors."
4.0,el cubrimiento de las cremalleras y la calidad de las mismas deficiente.
4.0,Works great for me. It does help a lot during my routine jog.
4.0,Fit great. Don‚Äôt see them lasting a long time.  Material is thin.  But they are comfortable
4.0,sooo much more padding than expected also its more full coverage than expected
4.0,nice fit and very comfortable.  Hope they last a long time.
4.0,"come with the zipper broke,but it is really nice shorts"
4.0,"This belt functions exactly as it's supposed to do. It's only been a week so I can't attest to the quality yet, but so far so good. It matches everything in the description."
4.0,Stitching color didn‚Äôt even match shirt
4.0,"My daughter wanted a simple single pearl necklace.  The chain caused her to break out in a rash, so it's not the best quality or maybe has nickel, but the pendent is fine.  On a new chain and she wears it 24/7 including the shower.  She's had it almost 2 months and it hasn't started to chip or anything."
4.0,This looks real it was a great buy but starts to rust after a while
4.0,"Pros:  Looks great, doesn't look nearly as cheap as it is, works well, crazy inexpensive.<br /><br />Cons: One of the small straps at the end broke off the first day, however because I use this watch to hide a tattoo on my wrist, I was pulling it as tight as possible so that it wouldnt move.  I cut it off, and the strap still functions perfectly. You can also hear the ticking."
4.0,"This is an awesome vest! You still sweat, but it allows air to circulate so you cool off quicker. Only down fall, the shoulders are not even(right side sits slightly higher than left side) so it slides towards my right shoulder. Other than that, hands down a great purchase. Will purchase this again when I wear this one out."
4.0,I ordered the 4-6 size for my twin 4 year old daughters. It is a bit on the small side. My girls have always been on the small side and wear anywhere from 3T-5T outside of this and depending on the cut. The majority of their clothes is 4T. This fits nicely on both girls but it definitely won't last until they're 6. I can see them outgrowing this in no more than a year while in most clothes it has taken them well over a year to outgrow clothes. Great material and quality but definitely runs small!
4.0,Once you get them on with hubby's help they feel nice!
4.0,Fits me perfectly. I'm 5'6&#34; 145 lbs and got the small. The material is nice and I've washed them several times already without issue. Make sure you air dry them after washing however! Will be ordering more.
4.0,"Added a great touch to my son's karate birthday party. Not printed all around, so not completely authentic, but a good costume piece"
4.0,"This fits so well.  It looks great too.  It's big enough to shade my eyes and face from the sun, but not so big that I can't see where I'm going. I use it on the river paddle boarding, at the beach and boardwalk and walking around historic sites.  It stays on my head well.  I did blow off one day on the river when it was very windy, but most days the breeze doesn't bother.  I've thrown it in the was several times.  I just let it air dry.  I've mushed it in suitcases and beach bags.  It pops back in shape each time."
4.0,Super cute rompers but it runs smaller.
4.0,These go perfect with a resin tortoise shell bracelet that I have. I can wear these together and look like I am put together perfectly.
4.0,"4 stars due to sizing; measured myself (size 10, I'm a large frame, muscular build) and I was in the XL range. Upon receiving product, I realized it was too large, sent back and ordered a medium, fit snuggly. Product definitely makes you sweat more! Smelled awful (like rubber) at first but after hand washing and wearing several times it no longer smells."
4.0,"The dress fit ok, will definitely need some kind of support,  it is form fitting.  but the sleeves were awful,. They were too much. Had to send it back."
4.0,I bought a size 10.5 3e and it fit perfectly.  This one is slightly tight may get better after a run in.  Not as comfortable as the earlier comfort tech I bought too.  Overall not bad.
4.0,"This is a cute printed romper. I am 5'7, 178 pounds, 40D with hips and I bought Extra Large. I will say this particular size with my measurements is not made for larger hips and thighs. Created a bit of a pouch in front due to this. I did not zip the back all the way up and added a belt so that I could wear it off the shoulders to give it a bit more appeal. It's a bit see thru so will have to wear the right under garments. I'm also going to snip the sides a bit to give a bit more thigh room. I would have bought a XXL if that size was available. Will make sure to wash it in cool water and hang dry to prevent shrinkage."
4.0,"On my quest for great gloves, one of my friends suggested Kangol.  Now, when people think of the brand, they think high end berets and other head gear but never gloves.  This pair has definitely made me a believer in other items from Kangol!  The gloves have 2 layers: The first one is the outer layer (wool blend) and the second layer is inside that consist of polyester but you could've fooled me cause it feels soft like fleece!  I have already tested these gloves on my iPhone and they work as advertised.  I don't have to rub my fingers to build friction to see if the capacitive screen will capture my touches anymore!  These gloves are price higher than its competition on Amazon.  If none of the other offerings suit your fancy and you wouldn't mind for paying for a bit more fashion, these gloves are great.  Looking forward to using them the rest of the winter!"
4.0,I loved this dress but it was a big bigger than what I thought. I read some reviews and sized up but should have stayed true to size.
4.0,"This is a very nice piece for the price its at. I am satisfied however it isn't exactly as pictured, it has a light brownish bronze like tinge to it. The box it comes in is black, lay it on top you'll see what I'm talking about. Not that big of a deal its black enough. One thing that concerns me is that it doesn't have a year aspect when setting the date, meaning you may have to adjust the date on a regular basis. Still for me that isn't a big deal. Also the wrist strap is nice easy to remove and you can be hand washed if needed."
4.0,This skirt is nice. The only reason I give this skirt 4 stars is because it fits a little looser than expected. Overall it's really nice.
4.0,"Awesome shoes, fit perfect, look great"
4.0,"Really like this top,  comfortable,  cute, not clingy, medium weight. Love the pockets, washes well. Plan on ordering in more colors."
4.0,This dress is so pretty! I got lots of compliments when I wore it. However it is a little long. I am 5'3&#34; and need to wear heels with this dress. The reason i gave it 4 stars is because the straps are adjustable which helped with the length issue.
4.0,I like these sunglasses. They will work ok for me.
4.0,Great bags but I thought they would be a little bigger. They would not fit a frozen pizza
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars, but mits were too small. great quality product though."
4.0,"I have arthritis and other conditions, and compression socks were suggested as something I could try to help alleviate my pain.<br /><br />I am not at all excited about the look of regular compression socks, so I was thrilled when these came up for review.<br /><br />They look really cool; I like the design a lot. They seem to be of good quality, and the fabric doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they didn't really help me personally, but I think it's because my issues in general are not going to be helped by compression.<br /><br />I think the current price is good."
4.0,I use this bag to and from the office and it works great for that purpose.
4.0,A little had to put on
4.0,beautiful just big for my hands
4.0,The bracelet caught my eye as soon as I saw it.  It was received as shown.  It does run a little small on medium bone structure.  An extra two beads would make it more comfortable to wear but I'm grateful to have it and for the blessing from the Buddhists monks.  Thank you!!!
4.0,"it's very nice. i just wish the watch didn't jiggle when you change the time, etc."
4.0,"These are very comfortable for casual wear, in an overseas environment being tested on gravel daily they've felt great, look good and they weren't pricey at all, besides that amazon shipping & customer service good as usual keep it up!!<br />Semper Fi."
4.0,It is beautiful and my young daughter loves it.
4.0,x mas gift for grandkids very popular
4.0,"Too tight, returned"
4.0,"Very, very cute. I am a 8, based on reviews, I ordered size up (Chinese 42) and it fit a little snug, Material is good, not cheap. I would buy another swimsuit from them."
4.0,"Cute, but don't expect a lot like in the picture, I received 10 and five of them are really tiny beads, other than that they look great, love the color."
4.0,These glasses are cute but not quite as nice quality as others I've bought at a similar price point. Light weight and still stylish.
4.0,"This was cute and I received a lot of compliments. The picture and colors looks as shown. It was large, not tight. It was my go to mask, but I did notice that I got hot if I wore it all day. But that could just be mask in general, as I was out more during the holidays than I have been in 7 months."
4.0,"This dress is perfect! I mean, it‚Äôs 100% synthetic material so I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt sweat too much but it‚Äôs exactly the look I wanted!<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1.5‚Äù, a size 6/8, and a 34A. I bought the medium. Fits perfect other than being a little loose in the busy (which was expected). The dress comes below my knee but a little higher than mid-calf."
4.0,"Quality: Good<br />Value: Good<br />Comments: Bought this for a teenage Hillary supporter. He loves it. Gildan makes sturdy 100% cotton shirts that are thick and not flimsy like so many t-shirts these days. Screen print is good quality and has stayed on without any issues through numerous washings. Color is not as vibrant as when we got the shirt, but that seems normal. Very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,The Rings are fun to wear.
4.0,"The pictures showed the sleeves as being lined, so that it is lace over fabric and you don‚Äôt see your arms. But in person it is just lace. Also, there is an elastic cuff at the end - I don‚Äôt know if I missed that in the description or not, but I had thought it was a loose sleeve angled outward. This is not the case. I am keeping it because I still think it‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs just not quite what I expected, which is why the four stars."
4.0,Love this phone case I use it almost every day great when you go shopping has pocket to hold credit cards and money.
4.0,A little longer than what I thought
4.0,"I purchased these pj's for a family member who is slender, athletic and 6'2&#34;.  I was worried the XL wouldn't be long enough but it fit him very well.  He's really enjoyed them."
4.0,Order a size up. Gifted it to my mom since she is a  size 10. I ordered XL
4.0,THE BOTTOM WAS TOO SMALL AND THE TOP WAS TOO LARGE.
4.0,"This product is very cute. Perfect for my 9 year old for Christmas, she wants to be a vsco girl. Loved all the things included"
4.0,Perfect size for my 20 month old. Only thing is sunglasses came broken.
4.0,"Gift for my daughter.....she normally wears a large.  I ordered an extra large just to be on the safe side.  She thinks it is going to be okay but certainly none too big.  Other than that, she loved it."
4.0,"PERFECT , PRETTY AND LOVE THE COLOR."
4.0,The dress fit great! The royal blue is gorgeous! However the lace sleeves are not like the picture AT ALL.
4.0,Cute but waaaay way way too big for my face. Not for me. I returned these. Seemed like good quality though! Worth a try.
4.0,I gave this as a Christmas gift my Daughter just loved it!
4.0,I ordered large should have gotten Medium falls off of me
4.0,i think im gonna buy another pair soon the one i order is a little huge but i like the material though.
4.0,Jewelry is perfect size and appears to be true to material. I‚Äôve had it on my fresh Industrial for around 2 weeks and I‚Äôve had no issues with it  rusting and the size leaves me enough room for it to swell and heal.
4.0,I liked them nice for the price
4.0,"I gave the item 4 stars because I was sent the wrong item. However, the return process was quick and easy. Additionally it took about a week for the replacement to come. I must say that the clips are absolutely beautiful! They go great with my champagne colored heels I bought for my wedding. I tried them on and have attached a picture. It looks perfect!!!!! So really the item should get a 5 star rating, 4 for getting the wrong item."
4.0,"Slipper is comfortable but order a size up. I wear an 11 size so I ordered the 11/12 and it fits small, almost to the point where I can't wear them."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a219fd14fdd74e618703de270f11412b]] Give this jacket a good press and you can make it look really nice especially with a nice dress shirt. The feel of the material is nice it‚Äôs 55% linen and 45% Cotton making it a cool & comfy wear. I wish it had a lining but it doesn‚Äôt but that‚Äôs alright. Still a good bargain for the money.
4.0,Slits are a little high at the sides but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice dress for the price!
4.0,Bought for Halloween was a tad small but nothing too bad worked for what I needed.
4.0,Pretty but I think it fitted a little tighter than your average headband.
4.0,Really cute booties!  They feel about 1/2 size too large all around but thick socks will take of the extra space.  Well worth the money.
4.0,"The reviews said to size up, but it was too large when I did. I returned and ordered a size down. The material is not thick and slightly see through, but not so bad that you need more than a slip and a tank underneath. I paid less than $10 and it is a novelty dress, so it works. I do like the length. Some of these dresses are so short and this one hits a little below my knee. I am 5'9""."
4.0,"Update:  I exchanged for the correct size and it fits great.  perfect for Pilates class or with jeans, I really like this top.  Yes, the design is pressed on, not woven in to the fabric.  You can feel the difference but it's any more noticeable than any other t-shirt with a design hot-pressed on it."
4.0,"Nice earrings at a good price.  The screw-on backs take a bit of getting used to.  I didn't give 5 stars for 2 reasons:<br />1)  The earrings are not consistent--on some of them, the back is what screws on and off, and on others, the front is what screws on and off.  One earring in a pair may be one way and the other is the other way--just seems odd.<br />2)  I found the threaded end of the shaft to be difficult to get thru my ear--the threads seem to catch and it can be a bit painful to work them thru.<br />All in all, they are OK, but I'm not sure I'd buy again."
4.0,This is a great sweat shirt . I where this to and from the gym . I think I will purchase four or five more .
4.0,"This is a cute top, but the sleeves are quite slim.  I have bigger arms, so I can't wear anything long sleeved under it.(which in MN, is a normal winter thing).  It is pretty much as pictured otherwise.  It was true to size, other than the sleeves"
4.0,"For the price these are off the charts. Great fit and length. I am 5'6""/155 lbs and the small fits perfectly. The construction and fabric are substantial. I still prefer my brands that were 3 to 4 times the price because of the quality/comfort of the fabrics but for outside workouts, yard work, washing the car these are my choice."
4.0,"Very cute, the fabric is soft and is not clingy, just what I expected."
4.0,"This hat is great for travel. Light weight, okay breath-ability, great for larger headed individuals. Material has a rating of  SPF 30."
4.0,This was a great item for mom on mothers day and the price considering if you go to vancott or another jewler was very good. it was a great piece to add to her collection. every mothers day for past 11 years.
4.0,"Fits large around the waist, and I already have a large frame to begin with. Otherwise very nice, lovely fabric."
4.0,"Well constructed, looks good and fits as expected."
4.0,"A little less than excellent quality, but they are comfortable and do the job"
4.0,"Quality is just fair, but the price is great. Well worth the money. May order a second one."
4.0,fits great and is comfortable.
4.0,"Fits as expected and shipped right away. Collar is a little large for my liking, but still cute!"
4.0,"Strike 1:  ordered the K version of the 007.  Didn't work out of the box.  I can't think of a single product I've ordered from Amazon in the last 10 years that was dead on arrival.<br />Strike 2:  ordered the J version, anticipating made in Japan version would be top quality.  The bezel was chipped in multiple locations.  It should have never left the plant.<br />Bunt:  most recent J version is OK except the date is not aligned with the window.  I'm tired of returning, and I'm over the notion that Seiko makes great quality watches.  If you want good quality, check out Orient.  Much better brand even though part of same parent company.<br /><br />Update 6/15 - this watch does keep good time, at least out of the box.  Just a few seconds a day off."
4.0,"This is the hard thing about buying clothes online, they are almost never a perfect fit.  This one came sized properly on my chest but the waist was huge on me, so I will be working on this one in my sewing room to get it better fitted."
4.0,"These sweat pants are not glamorous, they are what good sweats should be: heavy cotton, large, long, and they even have pockets. Hard to find such quailties these days."
4.0,Are comfy and thinner than I expected.
4.0,It has a beautiful pattern and great material quality. This is perfect for my little girl. It is stretchable and breathable. It looks good with t-shirts and sleeveless tops. I am impressed with the quality of this linen and it is suitable for everyday use. The color stays after washing and it is machine washable.
4.0,"The product is good. Nice weight for summer. Fits well. It gets a minus one star because in the picture it has, ""Their war is not over,"" across the brim. As you can see in my attached picture, there are no words. I was trying to replace my old hat I just lost, words on the brim and all, but this one will do."
4.0,"This fits as expected and washed well in the washer/dryer, which was super important for me as a mom of three little ones.<br /><br />I docked a star because it didn‚Äôt come with three rhinestones at the neckline as pictured. My toddler wanted the exact same one as her older sister and I was so happy to see this had the rhinestones just like our other one, but when it arrived it was different from the picture."
4.0,"I sized up and should not have. Runs pretty close to a standard unisex t-shirt size, maybe slightly smaller."
4.0,"Love my dress,  it‚Äôs comfy and fit as expected.<br />A little long for me but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and I just tied a knot in the bottom when I needed to do things requiring a lot of bending."
4.0,"Works pretty well but for light slimming, you may want to go a size down."
4.0,"I got these for the shower at the gym, so I was not looking to wear them for extended periods of time. They work fine as a shower sandal, however they are tight and a bit uncomfortable. If you are looking to get these as a more permanent sandal, I would recommend getting a 1/2 size larger than your normal shoe size."
4.0,My bf and I love them.
4.0,These hats are just what I wanted.  They have enough stretch to cover my locks whether my locs are worn up or down.
4.0,Great socks.  I just wish they were a little longer.  But yes....there awesome
4.0,amazingly high quality knowing that it is not original adidas product. looks good. and it feels good when i put it on.<br />I bought it to cheer up for my Argentinean team in World Cup 2014 in Brazil.
4.0,gives swag if you know wat you doing with it
4.0,I like the dad keychain but I received the wrong one  I was wanting the grandpa one :(
4.0,Disappointed that instead of yellow in the photo is actually off white. It had a chemical smell also.
4.0,"Product was a great fit for my husband, true to size. Also purchased in navy."
4.0,Stays on
4.0,I love how I pack it up and store it easily when switching purses or packs.
4.0,"Face looks good, but the black coloring on the wristband rubs off, leaving the underside of the wristband silver."
4.0,too big for women
4.0,Beautiful pattern! Lovely looking shawl... This gold a bit brassy. I think I can work with that. It is darker than pictured online. That was a little disappointing. I will deal with that. Definitely overpriced due to fact that the fringes are of poor quality. I think I will have alterations to remove them
4.0,Nice cap! Had one before. Good quality. I wonder why the same one with a blue bill is $10.00 higher?
4.0,A little more snug than I'd like but it serves the purpose.
4.0,"Fits nicely, very comfortable material, reasonably priced, navy blue color looks faded - satisfied with purchase."
4.0,"First off, didn't think it'd be this long but that was my fault for not reading closer. The head piece is WAY TOO SMALL but for me it was okay because I wear a hat on it for my cosplay. The curls tangle easily so do not run your fingers through it or brush it. If you leave them alone they're fine. I just put them on my shoulders and didn't touch them. My only true concern is the size. When I managed to get it on, it pulled my hair net off but it's not too bad because I barely have hair it's so thin. Just be aware. Also the bangs are a little too long so you may need to trim them depending on your costume. But overall this is my new favorite wig. c:"
4.0,Great birthday present for a preteen.
4.0,"very nice but a little bulkier than I expected, still beautiful tho!"
4.0,Great shirt. Glitters a little more than expected but nice for the person receiving it
4.0,"Looks amazing just like the photo, got a ton of compliments, surprisingly comfortable but it is cheaper materiel so it rips easily and is sheer so I would recommend getting a body suit or spandex for underneath!"
4.0,"Quality is great, except my feet are a little too wide for it to fit comfortably without slipping off. Otherwise, great product!"
4.0,"These are really good at keeping my shirts down, but sometimes they can pop out and need readjustment. Other than that they're really good, just takes getting used to clipping the shirt"
4.0,"Very cute, but a bit tight/pinches a plus size wrist."
4.0,Quality was good for the price but the lens were just too large for a small head so had to return them. Would have kept them otherwise.  Lightweight and stylish.
4.0,Works for what we needed.
4.0,It would have been five stars but the pockets are shallow and placed much too high.
4.0,The boots are great my daughter loves them. Minor issues are that the orange showed in the picture was brown on the sole. Also the buckle that was shown as orange was red. These are minor issues only because my daughter is crafty and fixed both issues with her paints.
4.0,"Cute! And flattering but it‚Äôs a weird, noisy parachute-like fabric."
4.0,I actually use these for my labret as a hoop. The shape is way more comfortable than a full hoop and is easy to put in and take out.<br /><br />It just fades quickly ‚òπÔ∏è That‚Äôs about it
4.0,"tight round the arms, its not flexible. i needs more flexibility, its good other than that"
4.0,They are so comfortable!<br />I love them@
4.0,Gift for the turtle lover and rainbow lover all in one. This is a gift and I'm very happy with it but I'm concerned the strings won't last when it is made bigger to fit over hand.
4.0,This is a beautiful necklace. Colors are very vibrant. Purchased as gift for my mother. I know she will love it.  One complaint is that the clasp is hard to manipulate. It is set so close to the stone that it is difficult to open.
4.0,Mens moisture wicking camo socks.  I actually ordered these for myself.  I am a women and wear a size 7.5 these socks fit great.  I use these when I am hiking.  They are thick enough and comfortable.  I  like the muted camo colors and the fitted tops.  The socks are cushioned and soft. Overall great hiking sucks for women or men.
4.0,was kind of hoping for something a little bit different but i still like it (if it could only make me look thinner!)
4.0,This cardigan has an excellent feel to it and the material is more on the heavier side.  The cardigan does have two pockets that can be very useful.  For me this cardigan was just to big and boxy and not flattering on me.  I am 5&#34;2 and 130lbs. I had to return because it just didn't look right.
4.0,"I bought a couple of these dresses some time ago and loved them so much, I recently ordered some more.  The cut is still perfect (for me) and the colors are nice, BUT the fabric used is a lot thinner than previously.  I really liked the heavier fabric used in the first dresses I ordered.  I will keep these new ones, but I won't be ordering any more."
4.0,"It's not the best for long term wear, but beautiful regardless."
4.0,Super comfy‚Ä¶I‚Äôve worn these a ton since ordering!
4.0,This baby bonnet is as advertised. The little pop of color is so cute. This is a gift so I can‚Äôt review fit or durability yet. You just don‚Äôt see these adorable hats on baby girls these day. Super cute
4.0,"This product is very solid. It had a good wight to it, not to heavy, not to light. the only bad thing about the product was it difficult to adjust the band.<br /><br />***product was not specific in mentioning that it was for a 46mm and not the 2nd gen 42mm***<br /><br />Update= i have not been able to get a band from this supplier that fits my 42mm so i dont know how it puts up with everyday stress"
4.0,fit well until they were washed and they shrunk being washed in cold water.
4.0,If the head in the picture is a child's head then it is fine.  But for an adult it would be very small.  Luckily it was for a preteen and will work but is still smaller than it looks
4.0,Cute sunglasses. Different.
4.0,This has a very cool look to it.  It is quite sizable so would look large on smaller men.  Nice feel to the watch band; soft and bendable.
4.0,it{s  ok  a little bit weak
4.0,"The watch was very comfortable and felt well built. It maybe too flashy for some, but for those who love the glistening crystals and reflective gold this is the watch for you!"
4.0,"Love the skirt, but the top rides up and doesn't stay in place. Will have to tack sides so won't slide up."
4.0,Feels great - lightweight and soft.<br /><br />The color is as pictured... more of a hot pink than a coral.<br /><br />I washed it and it kindof rolled up... I'd recommend dry cleaning to keep it nice and flat.
4.0,"Overall it's a good hat. It's cheap, but it serves the purpose. Just seems a bit low quality for the price. It could use a more substantial chin strap. The one that's installed works but seems like it might break with a strong wind. Overall a good purchase. It's got plenty of brim to cover your whole face and keeps the sun off quite well"
4.0,4 stars! Fit as expected! Pretty dress! But see through... need to wear something under it...
4.0,They sent me the wrong size twice. However they fit close enough i didn‚Äôt want to hassle with it. They‚Äôre comfortable even in the wrong size( too big)
4.0,"This dress is exceptionally cute, however I had to return it due to the size. I typically wear a size 6, and this Medium was too snug. I will be ordering the next size up, though, because it really looks great on!"
4.0,"Bought for my daughter who lives in FL , she loves them"
4.0,Pretty but don‚Äôt think it will last long
4.0,"They are perfect for me, only thing is (and this could just be because of my body shape), they're pretty loose in the waistband area. But I have yet to find a perfect pair of compression shorts for myself. My quads are getting bigger with muscle definition and waist is getting smaller. All in all, I would definitely recommend these."
4.0,"I would give these 3.5 stars if I could. Pretty cute, but I had hoped they would be more comfortable bc they are wedges. The design of the shoe makes your foot slide down putting a lot of pressure on the toes. My feet hurt a fair amount after wearing them more than a couple hours. Not the most uncomfortable, but definitely not the best...  ordered 8 for my size 7.5 feet and I think I made the right call.<br /><br />Update: after having these shoes a few months and breaking them in I found them to be very comfortable. I bought them in tan and black and wear them ALL the time. They look great with skinny jeans/pants. Cute to wear out without looking overdressed in heel heels.  I wear the black pair all the time for work and the rubber bottom at the toe of the shoe has started to wear away. So not super durable, but I would buy again for the price!"
4.0,"My husband wasn‚Äôt 100% pleased with size and quality..( a bit too much price wise )More on the loose fit size, had to alter a  bit for a better fit. I worked for the occasion it was bought for."
4.0,I like this items easy to wear and pretty
4.0,I have a larger size pair of these so I needed another so that I have two pair üòÄ The clasp on one is a little loose.
4.0,"Quality construction for the price. However, I feel the actual color of the tie and the picture are two different things. The tie itself is more of a &#34;frost&#34; white with the vine accents being ivory. Where as in the picture it looks to be an ivory base color with the vine accents being an almost gold color(this could be my eyes). This only poses a minor problem with the outfit that I have purchased the tie for, so it will be adaquate for it's intended use. Hence the four star rating."
4.0,"Most charms are nice, some of them are very poor quality! Overall, it was an okay product."
4.0,I order the white. It is not a true white more cream. It is a little thinner than it looks in the pictures. I think I will keep it but it was not what I was expecting in the color. I bought an XL for more length. I would say it fits true to size.
4.0,Zip up hoodie looks great and pretty well made however havent washed it yet to see how well decals hold up. Seems to be just a little fitted through midsection.
4.0,Size was right. Soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Got these for my wife, one broke immediately but for a price like that what do you expect? Great value, and they work great for her metal sensitivity."
4.0,Really like this top.  Cute and fits well.  Only problem is seams are coming undone after only wearing once.  Will have to re-sew several seams.
4.0,"The wallet didn't meet my expectations, unfortunately. Didn't hold very many cards. I couldn't fit more than four (4) cards. Hate to rain on ppl's parades, but........ Bummed customer. The fire hose part was well VERY well made!"
4.0,"It doesn't feel durable. I carry about 70 Softballs, a batting tee and Cones and it's held up well so far. I have however, been very careful with it because it feels like one wrong move and it will rip apart."
4.0,"The hat is well made, just a bit big. Received it quickly. Hope to get another hat soon."
4.0,Can‚Äôt beat the price. No one else offer a Swiss made watch that‚Äôs under $350 with a automatic movement like this one. It‚Äôs running at +7 seconds per day so far. Should slow down in a week or so once it breaks in.
4.0,This is a quality leather band.  There is even a tool provided to help in the replacement process.  The downside is the the spring pins have a small extension to help putting the new band on.  Unfortunately this small extension dug into my wrist:  so save the pins that were used to hold your old band on and use them rather than the other ones provided.
4.0,Good quality pendant.  The necklace is to small for me so I will have to order another.  The actual pendant is smaller than it looks in the picture but still nice.
4.0,"I received this corset yesterday and tried It on right away. It took a while to get it to fit just right but once I did it was great! Very sexy! I'm 5'7&#34; 210 with a smaller bust and I love how this fit me! The modesty panel in the back needs to be bigger to cover the entire gap if you're a curvier girl like me, but it's still sexy without it! It goes great with my garter and stockings!"
4.0,This hat is almost perfect. The rim needs to be sturdy but not too much. The pompom came off in the wash. I had a hard time unpinning it so I thought it didn't need to come off. I had to bend the pin to open it.<br />love it because of the lining. I bought 2 other hats but the cold air still came through; had me wearing 2 hats to stay warm. I almost want to give it a 5+
4.0,My kiddo has a small face so this fits him. I ordered so many of this brand as he won‚Äôt use other masks. So I hope this company won‚Äôt increase the price and will<br />Keep its quality.
4.0,I'm very pleased with this product.
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter this past summer and we really like its thin and the fabric seems breathable,and there's even a thing on the back where you can make it tighter or looser and we really like that it's a good hat."
4.0,A tad see through but good for price
4.0,Bought for a wedding and was very surprised/relieved at how well it fit considering I am in desperate need to shed some unwanted pounds and usually wear a +12. Made me feel sexy despite the coverage and hugged me in all the right places (of note....I‚Äôm a B cup with a big booty lol)
4.0,"It looks really nice and fits good, had to order one size bigger fearing I would rip the lace.<br />The only thing I didn't like was that you can't open it from the bottom.<br />Would recommend this product."
4.0,It fit me as expected however the color is definitely not as vibrant and pretty as the picture shows so that was disappointing. Only issue so far though. The dress is above the knee which is what I wanted.
4.0,The straps fit my bra and look really nice
4.0,Love this watch..
4.0,Cute a little see through ordered a medium
4.0,"Love this dress it, arrived last night. Most likely will wear it to church on Sunday. The fabric is of good quality and the material is stretchy so it will be kind to those who have areas that are not as smooth. I usually wear size 8, 5'4, 135--slender built--and ordered a small.  It's a bit snug around the chest and there is a gap between the button at middle chest area. I will wear it without the bow--has a softer look without it. I feel very feminine in this dress."
4.0,It fits well and looks good but the orange material around the collar is difficult to keep clean and is starting to pill a little.
4.0,"Holds you in , sexy yet classy"
4.0,Not as warm as I expected.
4.0,"S<br />Nice but smaller than my son‚Äôs other Nike sweatshirt of the same size, particularly in length.  He is recently a size 12 and this size says 10-12 but more like an 8-10.  Definitely will need to return."
4.0,good purchase for the money
4.0,"Fits as expected, very nice material. Very comfy!"
4.0,I'm 5'5&#34;/125# and the medium was incredibly huge (smalls were out of stock when I purchased this). It's so stretchy I'm worried that even a small wouldn't look as good on me as it does in the pic. The material is VERY thin and the mesh is a lot finer than in the picture as well. Overall not a bad buy for the price but I won't be repurchasing.
4.0,"The fabric is a bit sheerer than I like, but I love the pockets!"
4.0,Feels like a dream with soft flowy fabric. Fits me perfectly except a little long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and wear an 18/20. The yellow is perfect for my coloring. I would like to purchase more.
4.0,"Sadly, this was a bit too small (and short) for my taste and I had to return. If this was available in a larger size, I would love to re-order!"
4.0,Colorful.Very nice!
4.0,"I like my clothes really big so i ordered an XL even though my usual clothes size is an M. Yes, it was big, but not as big as i wanted it to be. I wanted it like super oversized look. That‚Äôs my only complaint though, overall it looks really nice and feels really comfortable! The insides are super soft!"
4.0,"Nice shirt. I ordered a small and it fits slightly snug almost as expected but I'm happy with it. I am on the petite size about 5'3"" and 110lbs. to give you an idea as to how it fits. Later I may give you a better idea when I post a picture of me wearing it."
4.0,No complaints. It is a nice swimsuit with a good design.
4.0,Product shrunk 4‚Äù in length when washed.
4.0,Love these shoes but I need a 6.5 and these are just slightly too tight to wear under my bridesmaid long dress. I was looking for shoes that would be comfortable but that would also give me good height.
4.0,I thought it was going to be lighter than it is was thinking it was going to sheer.
4.0,Delicate and elegant. It really looks pretty!
4.0,"Glasses are screen printed onto shirt differently than Tinker Bell image. On mine, the screen print had smudged a bit. Not worth the hassle of returning because I wanted to wear it to Disneyland, but It was slightly disappointing."
4.0,"Nice wallet, good quality.  Check how many card slots you need also, doesn‚Äôt have a separate flap for license which makes it difficult to remove license. Not the wallet fault but, mine for not looking"
4.0,For the price its a lovely watch. I am really happy.
4.0,"It‚Äôs really pretty the strings are lonnnng when you shorten the dress but the material is so soft and cotton, like tshirt material. It does run a bit small."
4.0,"Very Cute dress. I ordered two in sizes XL. One blue and one orange. The top of this dress tends to look a little bulky on me. Actually a LOT bulky. I have very small shoulders, which makes it look almost too big. Also because of how the dress falls on my waist, it makes me look much fuller than I would like to look. So to fix this I paired this with a nice denim jacket and it looked very nice. The only thing is the top cannot be adjusted because it is actually one full dress. It says mini, but it does not look mini on me because of my height. It is definitely not a long flowing dress, but it is not super short either. I really love this brand. It is affordable fashion, and there's something for everyone."
4.0,"Guys this hoodie is super cute, material is nice but when it says crop it means CROP. I'm 5'6 but I have a tiny torso and this sweater barely comes below my boobs. No joke. I got a medium."
4.0,Get so many compliments on this necklace!!! When you get it though check the small jump rings between sections had to tighten a couple b/c broke upon wearing. Still worth the $$$ would have given 5 stars BUT I shouldn't have to fix it.
4.0,Basic and effective<br /><br /> Vey dark.<br />Seem strong enough for regular use
4.0,"I'd buy a size down. I ordered a 10 and I'm 145bs, 5'6, and 34 D chest. I should have ordered an 8, but I wore it  so couldn't return it."
4.0,"So, I‚Äôm kind of ambivalent about this dress, and I haven‚Äôt yet decided if I‚Äôm going to keep it or return it. When I first put it on, I absolutely loved it! It was so comfy, and the length was perfect, plus I loved that it had pockets! Then, I did the full length mirror view, and I began to think that maybe I looked a bit like a Tellytubby.<br /><br />You see, those pockets stick out. A lot. This is the reason for my four stars; other than the odd shaped penguin pockets, it‚Äôs a darling dress. I thought about giving it three stars, but I figure that it‚Äôs more the fault of my body type than the dress, itself. Now, I knew about these pockets when I ordered the dress, but I decided to chance it, anyway. I have one of those apple shaped bodies with broad shoulders a wider waist, absolutely no hips, and thin legs. So, my thinking was that if anything, those pockets would lend me some hips and give me a waistline. And this theory probably would‚Äôve been a good one last summer when I weighed twenty pounds less (ugh!). Now, I just look like the Penguin and Tinky Winky has a baby. But I‚Äôm also kinda thinking maybe I could hide the pockets or stitch them in the dress somehow. I just love the color so much and would like to make it work. Any advice, ya‚Äôll? BTW, I‚Äôm about 195 lbs., 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and I think I ordered an XXL. It‚Äôs plenty big, and I could‚Äôve easily gone with an XL, FYI. Thanks!"
4.0,"Love ,love them..the waist is a bit tight.I am a size 8 .."
4.0,It does keep the sun off; however it gets scratches very easily.
4.0,"Ive only wore this a few times because I‚Äôm so afraid of washing it but it did fit very nice. I‚Äôm not as into anime anymore but nevertheless, the cosplay fit was good :)"
4.0,"This is so pretty. My only complain that it is kinda short in some parts, I am 5'8, so just something to keep in mind. Works perfect under leggings or thick stockings."
4.0,"Cute! Some straps were broken, but it was very inexpensive so I'll just fix it. Great variety for a low price, decent quality."
4.0,"Buena calidad de tela y justo la talla, mi nieto est√° feliz con su uniforme de Ronaldo."
4.0,As described. Fit was spot on.
4.0,Confusing to put on. Mostly flattering
4.0,This is a thin gold chain to hold a charm around your neck.  I purchased the 10K one to make sure it was a little stronger than 14K being it's so thin.  It shows off my necklace very nicely.  I have nothing bad to say about it.
4.0,"The fit is fine. Bottom of the shirt is a bit strange, but not a big issue (it‚Äôs also in the photo). I like the shirt overall."
4.0,"I‚Äôve had this for 6 months, i love it. The chain did break right away, but I use it as a clutch. Great amount of space"
4.0,I was looking forward trying out a pair of blue light blocking glasses. My boyfriend has a pair and swears they make a big difference for him.<br />The color of these is really nice. The shape fits my face absolutely perfectly. Upon unboxing I did notice one of the temples is bent much further down than the other (Which you can see in my photo.) I imagine  it should be pretty easy to bend back into shape.<br />These feel high quality and sturdy and are really cute and stylish. I am not sure how blue light compatible they are as they barely have any tint on the lenses. I do see a very slight yellow tint when direct it towards a light but it is very subtle.
4.0,"Excellent at first now, a few months down the line, there's very little support remaining."
4.0,The texture was very soft.  Good size
4.0,There is less stretch to these than I anticipated.
4.0,And it's pretty but a little too big
4.0,Beautiful item and perfect size if my 8mm chain I ordered is as this as I hope it is. Great detail. A little thinner than expected but for the price. A++++++
4.0,"Overall I liked the dress and was pleased with the quality for the price. Although I used the sizing guide, I would have been more pleased with the next size down. That said, I can tailor it slightly and then it will be fantastic."
4.0,"Cute but I thought they came together and buttoned. They don't it just slips on, no big deal. The button is only for looks. Fits good and doesn't slip or fall out of place."
4.0,I'm a size 12 and ordered the largest size. It's cute and high and hides stomach issues. Top fits loosly and would not recommend rough play or jumping into water in it.
4.0,Fit to size only issue I would say is the material  is thinner than I expected.
4.0,They are nice and stylish.  Not as dark as I had hoped but they will work.
4.0,"Just a little shorter than I expected it would be, but was very cute and nice quality."
4.0,fits my watch like it
4.0,"These are adorable, but be advised that they 1. Run large but 2. Shrink a TON in the wash. I read reviews saying they run big, so I ordered small. They looked just a little too big when they arrived, which was what I was going for. But after one time through the wash in cold, delicate, they shrunk so much that they're too small. If I'd known that, I would have bought larger/her true size. I can still stretch them on her now, but I was hoping to get more than one season out of them."
4.0,"I would like to give a 4.5, but I'm limited to whole numbers and I don't give anything a ""perfect"" rating (because seriously, what can't be improved on, just a little?)<br />I would encourage anyone to buy this bag - it's exactly what you'd expect: roomy, single-pocket, obvious what's in the bag by looking in it (as opposed to checking 5-8 pockets for your gum/pen/etc.)<br />Adjustable strap is nice too so equally appropriate for tall and short people<br />Don't let it fall off the seat though because with just the one closure (not zip top, not full close), things will go flying across the floor of the car..."
4.0,Cute. Fits perfectly and comfortable. Washed it once and the neck string came right out. Don‚Äôt have the patience to weave it back so I might don‚Äôt wear it again lol
4.0,"This product fits well, its fairly baggy under the arms and isn't as fitted as modeled but it still works! That material is a little thin too but it is easy to clean and has held up well!"
4.0,Love the item however I purchased 2 and one arrive with the velcro missing for the waistline part
4.0,I cut off the molle straps as they weren't big enough to fit on my overall straps.  I sewed on two straps on both sides  so that I could use it in multiple configerations on either side.
4.0,I wish they would have made the nose rests more durable
4.0,Beautiful nice fabric but runs small need one size up for tru comfort
4.0,Well made. Fits good. Just a little short if I had more of a booty than it would be a no. I'll wear leggings with it for sure.
4.0,only ok
4.0,Dress was as described.  I am 5'4&#34; 147 pounds.  I ordered a large and it fit nice.  length was just above the knee.  I wish it were a little longer for my taste but most would like.
4.0,I bought this as a replacement for my weeding ring as I broke my finger and it has been swollen for quite some time now. This a great alternative while I wait for me finger to shrink to normal size. It is a little tight on me so I may be looking to get another in larger size. I don't think the ring was sized improperly. I think the issue is more myself being lazy at my attempt of sizing a swollen finger. This Ring is of good quality. It is a little thicker than some of the other rings that I have seen. To me this is good. It retains it shape well but is not restrictive in any way.<br /><br />Quality improvement suggestion:<br />Make the inside of the ring a comfort fit. In other words round the edges on the inside diameter of the ring. The ring is not uncomfortable but it could be more comfortable.
4.0,I got this jacket and it's pretty good
4.0,"i loved it, but the top piece came a little big"
4.0,Very soft. Pocket is a good size very usable.
4.0,I gave it a 4 because my mom loved the hat.<br />The packaging was terrible. They send this out in a bag!...
4.0,"Swords were a little bent on the keychain and it‚Äôs very small, about the size of a quarter. Overall happy with price and what I got."
4.0,"This is my 2nd pair. They start out on the tighter side but stretch with time. The previous pair lasted me about a year.<br />For a sneaker, somewhat elegant. I wear them to work when my feet are tired."
4.0,Great product! For what it‚Äôs worth.
4.0,The person whom I brought it for loved it.....
4.0,These fit great but the fabric doesn‚Äôt breathe at all. It‚Äôs a mesh but clings like plastic when sweaty and doesn‚Äôt wick any moisture at all.
4.0,I thought the shirt would be small by the reviews but it fit me no problems.
4.0,"They were a gift, they lovedit"
4.0,"I loved this dress. It is very flattering, the print is pretty and the material is nice. I received many compliments on this dress. I only wished the straps were tighter (not stretchy). I also got it hemmed a bit so it fell right below my knees (I'm 5'0 ft). It's a nice dress for a great price."
4.0,Cute made for young children; 3 to 5 years old. Good for the price.
4.0,good quality perfect
4.0,This case is huge. My oversized sunglasses fit perfectly. I love the pattern and colors. It is easy to see and find in my purses with black lining.  The only drawback is it will take up quite a bit of space in my smaller purses.
4.0,Beautiful earrings. However right after I took these two pics i took them off. I wanted to wear one to work today and then chain broke. Literally only wore if for 5 min.
4.0,suitable for what it is.
4.0,"Installation was quick and easy - I've swapped out more than a few watch straps and had this one on in no time without using any tools.  It stays on and keeps its sizing thanks to a series of 5 velcro-like patches. The overall construction seems sturdy enough, although the plastic pieces are more brittle and may well be the primary fail point if the faux velcro stands up to daily life.<br /><br />Worth the price in my opinion."
4.0,"the size is perfect , the colour too but it begun to fade quickly with the use ."
4.0,I'm 5'9&#34; tall.. the size was fine.. just the length of sleeves and leg length short.<br />Kept anyway..live alone..nice and cozy!
4.0,Looks better on than off. Very elegant looking. Nice light fabric and stretchy but I‚Äôd label it glittery rather than shiny. I found the hem on the slit opening didn‚Äôt stay flat so I put in a couple of stitches. Like it so much I‚Äôm going to order it in pink also.
4.0,"Was approved by Rose Bowl stadium. I liked the bag. Wasn‚Äôt too big or too small. It fit what I needed it for. Only reason I knocked off a star was because the straps don‚Äôt stay put. You have to constantly adjust it back to the length you want if you‚Äôre moving a lot and I was. Overall, a good buy for why I needed it."
4.0,"It is easy to use and compact. The numbers are easy to see and read, but the chart for the width is kinda hard to figure out. Other then that this was a good buy."
4.0,"I was very Leary making this purchase because the price was so low, but I liked the style of the swimsuit. To my surprise it was a fantastic deal fits great and looks good on. Hides lots. I have not worn it yet so I don't know how it will stand up after washing and use.  So As<br />Of now I am giving it a four star."
4.0,I loved the item when i finally got it... It took 32 days to arrive!! Love the fit n fabric.
4.0,"Very comfy, they stay still no sliding in the shoe, no runs, wash in delicate cycle in a baggie to prevent hearing the balls hit the side of the machine.  Washed several times and have not lost a ball.  Received several compliments from people of various ages.  My personal choice would be slightly smaller balls. I feel the need to wear socks with all my  closed toe shoes, so these are great for the summer.  I also stopped wearing knee highs with my slacks and wear these instead."
4.0,I was afraid and ordered Large ...it.s too big but still wearable...it just doesn't  grip my body and is  like a regular work skirt. It.s somewhat thin but can have that fit like a glove appeal....i.m 5.4...139..medium...It.s fine for work...i am going to order my size in medium for that SNATCHED look. :)
4.0,I love these bras! They are so comfortable & fit great. The only thing to note is the fabric in the back is very high & will be seen above certain t-shirts/tops. I would still highly recommend.
4.0,"These are pretty nice sunglasses. They fit nicely and look pretty stylish. I like that they aren't that dark and just reduce the brightness slightly. They are comfortable to wear while running without any issues. Mine came with some scratches on the lenses as the packaging wasn't all that great, but it was definitely worth the price I paid for them and would buy them again if I'm in need of another pair."
4.0,"This is a great watch at a cheap price. I just needed a simple, reliable time keeper with a stop watch and buttons I could use easily to change times. This does the trick nicely."
4.0,"A little snug. But very flattering and provides a lot of support! I will get more in more colors too, the price is wonderful!"
4.0,Very nice  -  it is hard to find women's bi-fold so I am happy with the wallet.
4.0,"I like the TSLA brand.  The large size is more like an extra large but, I haven't laundered them yet and if they shrink a bit they will be perfect and the above rating would go from 4 stars to 5.  They look great and the colors are sharp.  I'll be buying more."
4.0,Its perfect size for my everyday needs
4.0,a gift that has not been given yet.
4.0,"I really wanted a shorter apron (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù)  but they‚Äôre hard to find. After I washed this it measured 28‚Äù long which is ok.  The one thing that could make it better is if the fabric didn‚Äôt wrinkle so much - after washing it‚Äôs rather wrinkly but at least not too stiff.  For the price, it will do."
4.0,"Nice hat pin, a little smaller then expected but üëå!"
4.0,"Put these in glazed donuts and M&M's for eyes, for the kids on Halloween"
4.0,fabric different than expected but its a cute hat. got several compliments.
4.0,Not 100% sure yet. Some days are better then others in terms of protection. But the real test will be my short visit to the Chicago area. I am a little concerned since there not very thick but are nimble and easy on off.
4.0,Really soft and true to size
4.0,"This Key finder hook is the greatest idea ever. As long as you hook it to your purse,<br />it will always be easily available."
4.0,Love the glasses for handling the excessive glare with computer screen and lights at the office. I do not care for the frame colors but otherwise very happy
4.0,"I love the idea of these earrings, it twirls as you put them in and then there are 2 looks with one continous earring  One looks like a cuff and the other earring looks like a traditional earring.  The design is quite clever. Because of the design you don't need earring backs that we all know we would lose eventually.  The earrings  look so small when it arrives but when you put them in they look bigger, I know I am not making sense but it's true.<br />The price is only $5.99 with Prime and free returns,  love that!"
4.0,I‚Äôm not a fan of the bottoms but that‚Äôs okay because I can use any black bottoms. I love this top! It‚Äôs so cute and flattering!
4.0,genuinely surprised how good this looks and how well it fits
4.0,Good product for a decent price. Everything went as planned
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 150lb, bought these to go with a costume and I had to struggle to fit them over the swell of my calf. Sadly they aren't all that stretchy, but my sister was more than happy to take them off of my hands."
4.0,Don't listen to the reviews. Order you regular size. Contemplating whether I'll re-order because its a cute top.
4.0,Won‚Äôt be purchasing Nike products anymore.  Socks were bought for grandchild.  They wear out too quick regardless.
4.0,"Hat it self is warm and fairly comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality for an 10 dollar Bluetooth beanie. Only issue I have, is it'll drop connection sometimes for no reason, but it only last a second then reconnects. Not enough of an issue to care about."
4.0,"Price is same as local discount retailer. I wear a tie daily.  I'll report back after a year about longevity. Fabric is a smooth high thread count per inch ""plain"" weave, uniform, no texture, as opposed to basket weave, twill, etc. Fabric has much more sheen than new wool slacks. Length is just barely adequate for 6' 1"" male. Sheen is not my preferred reflectance, as it shows food stains more than other fabrics."
4.0,The shoes Look dressy but they are like sneakers
4.0,"Very cute head covering, if a little large."
4.0,Love these great to where under clothes or alone
4.0,love it and the color
4.0,This is the perfect shirt for when you are going to be very active with a lot of movement and need sun protection.  The shirt is light but well made and has room for movement.  It is not so much a shirt to wear for appearance though it does look fine but moreso a good looking shirt for heavy activities.  Recommended.
4.0,Good for sleeping in
4.0,Fabric is thinner than the ones I purchased previously. Hope it holds up.
4.0,Very pretty. It's a gift.
4.0,Comfortable and breathable material
4.0,"These are running pants, not running tights. The fabric is comfortable and light.<br /><br />I use a 34 for regular pants (I am 6'1/2&#34; and weigh 155 pounds) and an L size fits perfect."
4.0,"The item is very cute. The size is definitely on the small side , which works for me. I am 5 feet tall and a size small and it is a tiny bit large in the waist but length is perfect."
4.0,"Pretty,!"
4.0,It's  nice
4.0,"Really nice shirt, good quality fits just a bit small. Looks green and black in the picture but is actually green and dark blue."
4.0,"I bought these because I just got engaged, and I'm paranoid about my ring. I originally bought a small and medium (2 of each) because I'm a size 4.75 ring. However, the small was WAY too small. I asked to return the smalls for larges. The seller told me to keep the smalls, and they sent me two larges for nothing. My ring is really wide, so the large still doesn't come all the way down to my finger on the top. I wish they made the carerings a little wider too, instead of focusing on the size of the ring. I still love the product, and the customer service was fabulous."
4.0,"I really love these shorts. They are super comfortable and fit great. 4 stars because they come with an internal nylon belt with a plastic buckle. The system works great but the buckle gets in the way of the fanny pack I use when I ride. It's not a big deal but just annoying. Get the shorts tho, they made me 3% faster."
4.0,"If you're in the market for Yoga Socks, then I would definitely recommend these by YogaAddict.  They give you additional grip when practicing, and are super comfortable.  They fit perfectly, and are easy to toss in the wash when you're done.  The rubber grips on the bottom have been high quality and I haven't had any issue with them falling off like I have with several other pairs of yoga socks.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I received this product free from YogaAddict in order to write a review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs 16 CFR, Part 255: ‚ÄúGuides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.‚Äù"
4.0,"My measurements:<br />Bust: 34B / Waist: 25.5&#34;/ Hips: 35 - 5'4&#34; - 112 lbs.<br />Size ordered: XS<br />This dress is true to size and very form fitting.<br /><br />Material:<br />It's thin, t-shirt like, so if you have a few extra pounds, this won't work for you. Also, seamless underwear is a must, especially if you are getting the brown one. EVERYTHING SHOWS (see my pictures).  The texture is soft and the color is a rich mid-brown, although this color does not look so great on me; it would look lovely on tanned and darker complexions.<br /><br />Overall this is a very nice midi dress for the price. I so liked it that I will order a black one.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
4.0,"I love this belt!<br /><br />But when i got it, the gold buckle rubbed on the white of the belt and left a mark while it was still packaged.<br />It wiped right off, but i think it will wear down and do it again quickly.<br /><br />But, it's still mot expensive for such a cute item.<br />I still love it!"
4.0,"the product seems of good quality. this is for adults, not children"
4.0,"Very light shoe, but nice"
4.0,"This is a lovely bracelet - I do love it. The size is good. A little loose, which I like for a bracelet. There's one thing that puzzles me though, I can nowhere find the ""Sterling Silver"" Mark on the bracelet (except on the lock) and that worries me! Also, I think it tarnishes very fast! But maybe that's the quality of the silver!"
4.0,"I ordered 3XL and It is smaller than I expected because I want to get oversize one but it fit as usual now.<br />Fabric, sewing condition are good.<br />I recommend it."
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but it didn‚Äôt fit me right. I‚Äôm also really tiny & I prefer a tighter fit. But altogether, it‚Äôs nicely made & my niece loves that we have matching dresses :)"
4.0,Love the look of them but they are a bit small and make my toes hurt. I wear a size 7 shoe. I was expecting them to all be beige and black as it said 2 colors but it came in 5 colors.
4.0,A little small but it's got a great vibration to it.  It's so quiet !  Powerful enough to make any ass happy.  A must try toy
4.0,It's a little longer than I'd like but fits nice. I might get it shortened.
4.0,Esta buena
4.0,"A little short compared to those that are a little long, but love the style"
4.0,"Cute belt, just like the picture! Thanks!!"
4.0,"I am not sure why this mini skirt dress is getting bad reviews, but I am here to tell you it is very sexy!  The corset fits perfectly as it is made to fit various sizes. I am a 36 D and I fell it pretty well, but I can see where a woman with a smaller bust size may not be as happy with the top. The skirt is small so a woman with wide hips and big butt will have problems with the skirt as well. It is short, but what I liked about it is it does not ride up!! I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think the material could be of better quality. This is the perfect mini skirt dress to look very sexy, but elegant at the same time."
4.0,This looks like the original swatch watch band and it fits perfectly.<br />They seem to last about 8 years in heavy use.
4.0,"Nice bag, some of the colors fell off thou"
4.0,"Good pants, but barely stretch"
4.0,"It fits perfectly. I just wish it weren't quite so clingy, because I'm overweight & it shows every roll."
4.0,"Although the fit was a little bit large, we are satisfied with the quality. Thanks."
4.0,"So i haven't seen many reviews on this shirt, which is odd as the price of this shirt, and its features make me think that it should have more reviews.<br /><br />By now you've seen the star rating.  So i like the shirt a lot, its nice and tight in the shoulders, and the &#34;vents&#34; on the back do a good job of aligning the body posture correctly.  I recently had shoulder surgery and my PT therapist has told me i have to straighten my posture out (I always thought i had great posture, so that wasn't fun to here).<br /><br />After talking to her, I decided to use an amazon gift card on this purchase as it was a relative unknown.  Fortunately I got it pretty quick and suited it up.  The tag mentions you should only use it for a few hours at a time.  I disregarded this as i'd been pulling my shoulder blades back and down for a few days and felt like i had &#34;decent' posture.  This worked out ok for me, as the shirt immediately helped me align better, but did not feel like compression tape that would artificially pull my shoulders back (and my pt said she wouldn't be doing anyway).<br /><br />So all in all i wear this pretty frequently, it does feel good, it doesn't hurt my back, and i am pretty sure that between the shirt, my pt's exercises to straighten my posture, and my desire to have a functionally shoulder again, things are going great.  I highly recommend this shirt if you are recovering from surgery and like me have let your posture change due to the sling you are forced to wear.<br /><br />Only the price keeps it from being 5 stars!"
4.0,Loosens a bit but great everyday belt value
4.0,Bag is more malleable than I‚Äôd ideally like but overall it‚Äôs a good bag that holds quite a bit. Side pocket comes in handy as well as small top outside pocket. Mesh pocket inside just gets in the way really. Had no trouble with with clear bag policy.
4.0,"Great shirt!<br /><br />Material is really thin and feels flimsy, but hopefully it'll last longer than I think it will!  Style is great and the top fits well.  I ordered a small and I'm 5'3 and 117 pounds"
4.0,"I did specific measurements because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and very curvy. Even with my busy measurements in hand, the dress sadly doesn‚Äôt really accommodate for them. I mean as the lacing only covers them and doesn‚Äôt actually go to my waist as is pictured. Maybe another measurement of my torso length would have fixed the issue.<br />I have tulle underskirt on in these pics.<br />It‚Äôs absolutely great for the price. I‚Äôll accessorize and get waist showing better"
4.0,Beautiful I wish they had more colorsüòä
4.0,daughter loves this dress -slightly short from a mom's standpoint.
4.0,Beautiful necklace. Purchased to wear in wedding coming up in September.
4.0,Much bigger than I thought and PERFECT for me. I love bigger bags and this looks classy. My only complaint would be the packaging. When the parcel arrived the plastic it was sent in was torn so the side of the bag has scratch marks on it
4.0,"I love these!! I just wish the silver was a little brighter and shinier, it's a pretty dark silver that seems more like a dark gray."
4.0,"Material a little thinner than I expected, but it fits great!"
4.0,It's definitely not USA sizes so be sure to use the size chart.
4.0,They work for Chakra work.
4.0,Flowy. Comfortable. Soft.
4.0,I love the purse!!! However the the pice that snaps on frequently pops off.
4.0,"It is not cotton, but kind of nylon-y blend.  I'm pretty small and got a medium.  A large would fit me more like the picture shown. Notice how the sleeves are going over her hands.  My sleeves go to my wrists only.  It is a cute top."
4.0,I thought they went up higher. And they are not to be worn long. But very cute.
4.0,Cute inexpensive gift.
4.0,"I really like the fit of the tank. It‚Äôs comfy, stretchy, and fits perfectly as a layering tank. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a compression tank though. I don‚Äôt feel any compression wearing it."
4.0,Love the material. It's a beautiful dress
4.0,Very good quality nust not ad long as I thought it would be.
4.0,"This bracelet is lovely, and the color is beautiful. The magnetic clasp is easy to use. The bracelet is comfortable to wear. It is a bit large on me since I have dainty wrists, so I had to twist it around itself so it wouldn't fall off. Overall, very nice bracelet."
4.0,Really cute. This seems somewhat durable. Probably don‚Äôt trust it with your coins but good to hold bills and cards at least.
4.0,"I like these pants a lot. The one thing that really bothers me is that the front pockets are so thin that when I put my phone in my thighs keep accidentally touching the screen, so I have to turn it over. Nitpicking, yes, but I don't have this issue with other pants."
4.0,"Sexy and witchy!  I have a 40 D  and 140 lbs chest and a L fit me perfectly.  The plunging V neck is perfect to show off a necklace of amulet.  The material is soft and stretchy so you have room if you need a little extra give in some areas.  Very heavy mainly because of the beautiful and generous bell sleeves.  Tapered waist to give a flattering and feminine look for any shape. Very well made with no raw edges and very true to size. However, have a lint roller handy because this is a magnet.  With that being said, I will still order in different colors. Definatly for those who like to have some edge to their wardrobe.<br /><br />Great brand.  Hoping to find other items from them to add to my closet.<br /><br />If my review helped you, please click the helpful button. Or comment if I can answer any other questions &#60;3"
4.0,I like this dress alot! The only thing that could make it better would be pockets! Easy to dress up or down with Jewelry and a scarf or short booties. Or just with my Birkenstocks. Great for breastfeeding!
4.0,"good on the waist, too short on the legs even the xxl"
4.0,They are cute.  Need to change backing so that earrings stay put against ears.  Color is beautiful but one earring has lesser color.  I didn't bother to return since they are not wear together side by side.
4.0,"This is a great little nightlight for my sons room. I wanted something that wouldn't take up a ton of room and would be easy for him to use and not break. This is nice and small and would fit on a small table or shelf with out taking up to much room. This works really well but getting the the area with the batteries is a huge pain, I had to go and find a screwdriver that would fit. Other than that this works great and all the colors are very pretty."
4.0,Very nice thing and lots of room.
4.0,"easy use, good quality"
4.0,Got as a gift for someone else. No complaints.
4.0,"The bill is a bit longer than I thought, but it's still a lovely hat. Makes me feel sassy haha. I always get compliments on it, I love it!"
4.0,"These are very soft and comfortable. Everything lays flat. There is a tin these are very soft and comfortable. Everything lays flat. I gave it a four star because there‚Äôs a very narrow, strong piece of elastic in the waste band. It‚Äôs fine once you get them up but it is tight getting them up. I hope I explained this well"
4.0,just what I expected. runs a little fast
4.0,These were purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loved them
4.0,Great bras for the price. Fit well but I‚Äôm time they break. I have had them for over a year and I‚Äôm my last one so for the price they‚Äôre great. I wear a 38B
4.0,"I ordered this in a small and it fits really well if you want a sexier look. Definitely need a cami if you don't want to show too much cleavage. For reference, I'm 5'2&#34; and 135lbs, 32DD. I'd get a medium for a more modest fit."
4.0,My son-in-law liked it
4.0,I like it's ability to clean my shoes. I didn't like that my suede leather faded somewhat during cleaning.
4.0,"Good gloves- they do get wet when playing in the snow. But, they are long enough to make sure no snow travels down the jacket arms."
4.0,Really liked it. The piece keeps it on the round chain breaks easily! Better to remove and attach to round key chain itself.
4.0,"Purchased for my kids delta rune Halloween costume and general cosplay. He loved it! Fits great for a 5'7"" big kid."
4.0,"Pretty ring, but looks like a glass gem, red with a pinkish tinge.  Sized well.  I didn't like it, so returned.  I have other BONLAVIE rings that are much prettier and look like a steal for the cost.  This one is priced appropriately."
4.0,"Very fun for the price, have worn it three times already, cute tassels"
4.0,Really cute the only issue was each side curled up at the bottom!!
4.0,Very warm jacket.  My biggest complaint I have is it just doesn't pack small.
4.0,"These pants are fine. I'm 5 foot 5 and anout 140 pounds. I typically wear anywhere from size 6 to size 9 in pants, and I bought these in medium. They fit fine. There isn't anything wrong with them.  There also isn't anything special about them. They are more like pajama pants than other yoga pants I have owned.  They aren't particularly tight or form fitting, and are a little on the thin side. I will wear them around the house and to sleep in.  I won't buy another pair."
4.0,"Very nice chain. Great quality for the price, I have no complaints and recommend."
4.0,Love this wallet; the only reason I didn‚Äôt give five stars is because the credit card slots are very tight making it difficult to get my cards out.  I‚Äôm hoping that with time and use the leather will relax a little and it will be easier to get my cards out. The magnetic money clip is fantastic and holds my bills securely.
4.0,"Nice size watch that looks great on my wrist.  However, the leather strap is thin and probably won't last very long.  Also, the glass face scratched really easily.  Expected for the cheap price though."
4.0,"They were cute , nice lite fabric  . I liked the cute design . I read in other reviews to order 1 size up than my regular size , this is true  . I am a large,  so I ordered an xl . Fit great  ."
4.0,First fit was perfect...hang dry the blouse b/c it shrinks!
4.0,"I like these earrings, I wear them often -- but I have to push the backs right up against my ears to keep them from drooping."
4.0,"my bf loves this hat, although i must complain that the color in the picture shows the golden khaki color on the front panel and what i received was bright yellow. it fits a bit loose, it raises up off his head and makes him look like hes wearing a trucker hat. other than that its a great hat!"
4.0,"Stretching your lobes takes time, dedication and patience. This kit is perfect to get that done.<br /><br />My lobes are already stretched, however they grew up the last few years (I had a job that didn't allow them). I had went from a 1/2 inch to a little under a 0 so I needed something to get the started again. This was perfect.<br /><br />With this kit you can start from scratch and work your way up. The stainless steel is perfect for keeping it hygienic and allergy free.<br /><br />Each size plug and taper is individually rapped as a set. My only complain it they are not labeled and I received two of one smaller size (10s I think) no biggie because I didn't need them at the time.<br /><br />Overall great starter kit. Improvement would be to label the bags. Other than that no complaints!<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My reviews are for the consumer and have not been manipulated or compensated in any way."
4.0,"I love that this is not just a iron on sticker. It's very well made and soft. With that being said, it runs super small. I got a xxl for my daughter who usually wears a L. So size up!"
4.0,Fits as it should. Nice Harry Potter T-shirt that looks a little more &#34;adult&#34;...
4.0,"I ordered a 2x based on the posted size chart and it was too big.  I wonder if the chart is actually for band size and not bust measurement.  I sent it back and was hoping to reorder this color in an XL but it has been out of stock.  I ordered it in black instead and the XL fits correctly.  The material of the black is not as soft as the navy, which is a little disappointing, but it is still a nice shirt.  I‚Äôve ordered another in the army green but haven‚Äôt received it yet.  I will order in navy if it is ever available again.  I would recommend this shirt."
4.0,"I got this pendant for my wife, she really liked it. It is not too big and the chain lock can be adjusted to fit the desired length."
4.0,"Material is not what I thought it would be. I also ordered a size up thinking it might be too small since I am a tall woman. However, I still love the shirt."
4.0,mens thermal are great
4.0,Husband really likes these. He says they are snug in the right places.
4.0,Very light weight and breathable
4.0,"So I just tried it on and this dress fits me really well and is pretty cute! Obviously keeping for that reason. The material is pretty cheap and close to see-thru. I don't expect to get more than a season or two out of it, but it'll be great while it's here I think. If it disintegrates in the first wash I'll update yall.<br /><br />For reference I'm 5'9, 157lbs, and hourglass/spoon shaped."
4.0,"I have 38E full breast so it is a little small bUT when you wear a shirt/tank/whatever over it, you can't really tell."
4.0,Nice shirts of acceptable quality.
4.0,Really nice dress ...
4.0,My son was happy
4.0,"Great product. Does the job well. I wish it came with instructions on how to re-fold it to put it back in the bag. After trying for 15 minutes I finally found a video that showed me how to do it. Other than that, I'm pleased!"
4.0,Very nice quality. Slightly oversized but look great. Recommend
4.0,Quite pretty. A little smaller than I needed. Would be a great gift for a child.
4.0,This dress was somewhat large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 155lbs and the medium is big. It also doesn‚Äôt look anything like it does on the picture of the model... Just does not hit my body in any of the same places. Looks like the same dress but the cut is a bit off from the photo. I got a medium and a small would have been fine.
4.0,the ears do not stick up and its a little big
4.0,Wear these for swimming and they are comfy!
4.0,"Cool shirt, but be careful with the sizing because they run small and are very short. The design is cool."
4.0,Great product but unfortunately there is a 'sticky' tag on the front.
4.0,I use this as a joint holder because it‚Äôs sturdy enough to withstand my MS and not break when I shake trying to open it
4.0,"Mostly great quality. The strings could have been a little better secured, but they did the trick. Very cute and spokey."
4.0,This is an adorable bracelet. It seems well made and I'd easy to put on. The magnet is quite strong.
4.0,"The description is inaccurate. The socks are absolutely not thick. They are good socks and I am satisfied with them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I got another set and wear them a lot.  They are very comfortable.  Typically I get up in the morning and put on athletic socks and go exercising right after breakfast.  When I get back home, I shower and usually my go to socks are one of the paris in this collection.<br /><br /> I added a star to my rating.<br /><br />Now, my only criticism is that they need to have a larger variety of colors.  I'd suggest an alternate set of browns. beige, green."
4.0,It gives me a lot of options for various necklines!
4.0,"Pretty sure this is a youth beanie, but I mean then it is tighter on your head! Which is fine for guys who are not worried about their hair!"
4.0,"Nice quality, small was too large for our Bishipoo- so sold them to neighbor who has a larger dog."
4.0,Loved this suit!
4.0,"They're small so it's tough to get the back closed on them. Otherwise, like them a lot!"
4.0,Smaller than I thought it would be but it's really cute.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô even, 190lbs, athletic build.  if I lift my arms my stomach shows and the shirt feels unusually short when I put it on."
4.0,The sweater appeared to be great quality but way too small. I normally wear XL in hoodies got this one in 2XL because of reviews and it was like a medium. Had it fit I would have kept it and ordered more colors.
4.0,"Perfect fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, though, and I don‚Äôt wear high heels;  cut 4 inches off because the dress pooled on the floor at my feet."
4.0,"I like the different colors, the different styles, they are nice looking earrings, I like that there are nine pairs, one little thing I did not like was it was a little fragile. Because one of the hooks of one of the earrings came of, had to bend it more to fix it, other than that these are good tassel earrings!"
4.0,This bra can work for bustier girls. The key is to place your girls where you want them to be and then stick the bra on. I found it works better when you push them together and then apply the bra. I wear a size 36DDD/38DD and I got the DD. The DD works well but I will also try the DDD to see which is a better fit.
4.0,Not bad for the price but the color I received was more of a beige than a pale pink.
4.0,Fits ok- will paint and up date
4.0,Good floor length for me (I'm 5'7&#34;) even in small heels. I expected it to be quite tight around the hips but it is not.
4.0,This was too small for me :(
4.0,I don‚Äôt give 5 stars just because the coat has a lot bottoms
4.0,"These are great but it‚Äôs more about the length than how much it compresses. I‚Äôm 6 foot, 200 lbs with a 36 waist. I ordered the xl assuming they would be long enough to not ride up and end up at the stomach. They do. They are skin tight yes but if you are wearing one and bend over they will ride up on you. Bummer they aren‚Äôt a tad longer but hey beggars can‚Äôt be choosers."
4.0,Good pant.
4.0,Nice lightweight dress but runs a little small.
4.0,It got a little too short
4.0,"I‚Äôm a 34 DDD and ordered a large. The top is super cute and technically fits (and I definitely wear it), but it‚Äôs a little tight on the girls. Definitely get this if you‚Äôre smaller up top, maybe think twice or order up a size or two if you‚Äôre bustier."
4.0,Super cute! A little thin and fit is a bit big.
4.0,I really liked the flag design so I decided to try this mask out. It fits pretty good. It's thick fabric so I find myself wanting to take it off after just a short amount of time. I get very warm. It held up good in the washer and dryer. It has some stretch to it as well.
4.0,Only comes in whole sizes.  Husband wears 8 1/2 so ordered 9.  Since I was going up a 1/2 size I picked 2w instead of 3w.  He really likes them
4.0,Ok for the price - wear around house or grocery shopping
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù 150 pound female. I bought a medium thinking the small would fit kids medium fit women and large fit men. I was very wrong. These are men‚Äôs sizes for sure. The medium would fit a 6‚Äô10‚Äù+ 200 pound man. It protects the whole forearm on me, but the pad doesn‚Äôt wrap around my forearm because my arms are so small. I got the medium shinguards and they were perfect. These are huge and bunch up in the inside of my elbow, making it extremely uncomfortable an ineffective, because it slides around so much."
4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars, if the color didn't rub off. It's well made, has lots of room - in daily use for entire 3 weeks had no issues, except it left a brownish hue on lighter color shirts and pants, and on a hat that I kept in it.  I am not sure if I can wash the bag in a washer."
4.0,Ran a bit small for my 12 year old stepdaughter. So I reordered and made sure that it was gonna me large on her. She loved it.
4.0,So comfy. Pretty big
4.0,Was exactly as expected. My daughter loved it this bracelet.
4.0,"it worked super well and i loved it!! amazing and i felt super pretty. the belt does break, but superglue fixes it and it runs a little small. for people who are tall you might want to size up"
4.0,"Works quite well, except that my head and neck still get cold.  I bought two onesie pajamas, one hooded and the other one not.  The hooded one works much better.  This one, the unhooded is OK for spring, but not for winter."
4.0,Worked well. Did not damage the hat.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a lot looser than most shirts fit me (medium) so at first I thought I would have to send it back, but it‚Äôs so comfortable I decided to keep and I get lots of compliments on it. The thickness of the shirt material is just right and very soft. I like it."
4.0,I did not like the material. It is a little scratchy
4.0,So far my granddaughter likes them and will wear them in a tournament this weekend
4.0,"The pants are great, but the length is a bit long for a petite, I am walking on the hems and will have to hem them to fit."
4.0,"As advertised (very bright, easy to manipulate the lights)."
4.0,I use this product for my son he really like the socks .I like the texture and the colors.It is cotton all the way
4.0,"Nice quality scarf. It could be a little longer, but it works just fine."
4.0,"cute, but i ordered the tan-ish color and its definitely see-through and thin material"
4.0,Not bad...would have preferred numbers and hands made of metal or white so they stand out but not bad
4.0,I'm going to be fair and rate on quality and design style of dress. I loved it super cute just like the picture you see posted. The material is like a silky rayon and it is not see through. Very adorable with the slit on side and off shoulder design.  Now the only negative comment is it runs small so I would definitely go a size or 2 up. Since it is not stretchy material there's not much you can do if you are bustier especially. So keep that in mind. Other than that Perfect dress for spring and summer. And I will be exchanging for 1 size up. Can't beat the price. And fast shipping. Happy shopping !!
4.0,It came when they said it would. Was what I expected with no surprises or complaints. It was eay to put onto my ear.
4.0,"Gift, but haven't gotten a thank you yet"
4.0,"Bandanas are nice and color is good. I have already washed them and the color stayed nice. These are larger, so will cover almost the entire head. A little large if you have a small head and are looking for the same look as the model."
4.0,"The hat itself is very excellent quality and I got it in 2 days! BUT, it is pretty small. I don't know if I just have a big head it what, but its a little small."
4.0,"I reviewed previously.  At first, band seemed sufficient but decided to change it for something less flimsy.  Still pleased with the watch."
4.0,My son LOVES these shoes. They look great on and don‚Äôt have a cheap shoe look. Sometimes shoes have a shiny gloss to them and it cheapens the look. These look great on and he said they are comfortable.<br /><br />My only issue with them is the bottom isn‚Äôt made from rubber but foam (which is becoming more and more common). This makes it slick and not easy to grip when running around. He‚Äôs an active 8 year old so that‚Äôs my one star knock down on the product.
4.0,it fit well out of the package and looks nice also.
4.0,"These were great earrings, I really like them a lot and get lots of compliments when I wear them!  They are light and easy to wear all day!"
4.0,"I like the soft fabric and good quality. I just expected the print to actually have glitter, so the words don't pop like in the picture."
4.0,Nice heavy chain
4.0,It's an okay purse
4.0,I am wearing it and love it.
4.0,"I have to wear ear protection at work. Ear plugs bug the crap out of me. So, I was issued a pair of Titus in green. I love them. They fold up compact in my bag, are durable and seal tight. My only issue is the band. I have a small head and sometimes even I feel like they are squeezing my head like a grape. The same tech that makes them fold up compactly makes the fit super tight. You can't fully expand both ear pieces down you can pull one down and make room but not the other. So if you have a large head these may not be for you, but on the other hand if you find other headphones are too loose these may be perfect. I liked the green so much I ordered the grey just in case I leave them laying somewhere."
4.0,"good quality,<br />only thing that the main front and back pockets have very delicate material inside maybe will tear if using keys after a a while,  howevere the pockets on the arms are good enough for holding tough objects<br />for the price its ok,<br />i would buy again<br />love the jackets<br />be sure to order 1 size above your normal size"
4.0,"The shorts are beautiful and just what my husband wanted, except he ordered a size 32 and they are more like an American 30.  I sent them back and ordered a 34 instead."
4.0,very pretty I love it!
4.0,"I was  so excited to get this dress, is beautiful, this is not the first time that I buy from this designer, I love his clothes. I normally use size 8-10 US. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, I wear bra size 38DD. And I buy size XXL and IT doesn‚Äôt fit me!!!!! I‚Äôm so sad! Because is really beautiful. Well, this run TOO SMALL.  That‚Äôs because I put 4 stars.  I‚Äôm going to return it."
4.0,"Attractive glasses and fine for daytime driving with glare reduction.  However, driving at night with these glasses may be problematic since your vision is darkened though the reduction of glare might be slightly better."
4.0,My wife really liked this hat.
4.0,"High quality, but fits small. Does not cover my chin."
4.0,"Came in a useful carrying case. Umbrella is a little stiff to open and close, but might loosen up over time. Or might not, but I'll be using it for sun, so that's not as critical as for a rain umbrella. Pink color is very different from photo -- much less rose-colored, and more of a dusty mauve."
4.0,"Emblem silk screened, not sewn on, but Canik hats are hard to find. Worth the price."
4.0,The color is  a very very bright neon orange
4.0,"Got a much larger than expected size due to other reviews and it fits well. Although, gf did comment (no surprise to me) why I thought she wears such a large size on the label. It looks great on her, though most of that is due to her :-)"
4.0,"I would recommend it for medium size hand , the original band comes with apple watch fits perfectly for my wife hand, but she wants a narrow band.<br />If HAOZOUSA can make the  S/M band starting with 5.2 inch circumference that will helpful for people with small wrist.<br /><br />Rest the build quality and durability is on par with the original band.<br /><br />So i returned it and the return process was a breeze."
4.0,"It's amazing, my boyfriend loves it and he wants me to get him a few more so he has extras when this one stops working üòÇüòÇ"
4.0,I ordered this in the blue &amp; I loved the color. The material was soft &amp; flowy &amp; comfortable to wear. I had to send it back because it was just a tad too small for me &amp; it didn't come in a bigger size.
4.0,I love that this purse has many compartments and I am able to fit a lot into it. So far it seems to be very sturdy and it looks more expensive than what I paid for it. It's made well. I would buy it again.
4.0,"This skirt is great for me, as I am quite tall and slim, so the stripes gives me some curves that I don't normally have. I love wearing it with both the matching cropped sweater and solid tops. I have found that a dress shirt that is actually a bodysuit looks really good with the skirt also."
4.0,"Not as comfortable as the same shoes, purchased previously"
4.0,"It's so sparkly! The pink on the shoes is a little darker than the clutch. The purse has a slight glue smell. I ordered one from another seller and I just set it out near a window for a few hours to air out. I ordered a size 10 and it's a very perfect fit, wish they sold larger sizes. Over all I'm satisfied."
4.0,"Somehow mine came to be short sleeved not like the picture. But regardless, it is comfy and fits as expected on the waist then flares out. Very cute. Careful with the zipper since it is delicate. Somewhat stretchy material in case you have broader back/shoulders."
4.0,I wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked them at first because they felt so thin but I know I will appreciate it in the summer. When I tried them on the felt very comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 3 120 lbs. I ordered a large. Elastic is comfortable
4.0,Legs Not long Enough
4.0,Very pretty dress! I work it to my brother in law's wedding and it was perfect! It was simple enough to accessories and make it as fancy as needed. It fit very well and was long enough... I am taller than the average but it still went to my feet.
4.0,Shoes are nice but have to say they are a small size 11. I‚Äôm hoping they will loosen with wear?
4.0,I love the shoes but they are a bit heavy when you have to work in them all day. I wish you could make them a bit lighter! These are great shoes if you have to work around water at all.
4.0,"Pajamas in big boy sizes are hard to find. These were decent and comfortable, but ran a little big."
4.0,Nice looking hat.  Will have to take it in a little as it is a bit large for me. (Hats  often are too large for me).
4.0,I am 5'3 and weigh 120 with a 32 DD bra. I ordered a small. It fits great (the top). The shorts are a little weird feeling on. I bought this just for the top anyways. It is super cute. I like it a lot. The material is descent. I would buy again.
4.0,Comfortable and  stylish! Love the fit of it!
4.0,The shirts fitted small. The prints were cute and as pictured.
4.0,pretty dress. can't wait to wear it! just wish it was made in XS.
4.0,"For the purpose i purchased, it is fine! i wanted something that would just give a seamless look, no tyres or handles showing, this is perfect for that. if you are looking for the cringing, waist training type, continue your search this is not for you!"
4.0,It looked nice had a lot of pockets too bad it was too big for my needs
4.0,I really like the size and shape of the stone but the picture shows some color variations that aren't present in the stones so they appear more simulated than genuine stones. I will buy from this seller again
4.0,"Worked perfectly for my husband for Halloween, the print is a little off when you put on the costume but it was great for what we needed it for!"
4.0,"This is the first scarf of its kind that I have purchased, all my others having two ends.  I thought it was time to try out this newer style.  I tried it on with a white turtleneck and it looked very nice along with the jewelry I had on.  I'm actually waiting until the weather turns much cooler to use this.  I don't get cold easily, but for those winter days when it's really cold outside--down in the 20s--I thought this might be nice to try.  The fabric is very soft and comfortable and the item is well made.  It matches all my white turtlenecks perfectly because it doesn't have an off-white or a yellowish cast to its color.  I'm sure I'll enjoy it when the weather is colder.  For now, I'm just enjoying trying it on to see all the different ways it can be worn--and there are quite a few."
4.0,As expected.  Very nice hat.
4.0,Great product. Like the ear loops.
4.0,there is a small piece on the watch band that irritates my wrist and causes a rash but the band itself is cute
4.0,"I got this for my wife as a Christmas present.  We both liked it, but neither of us love it.  She's keeping it.  There were no flaws and the purchase experience was fine.  I think if peas really mean something to you, then it could be a &#34;great&#34; present."
4.0,"I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase of this top. The product arrived on time and nicely packaged. The plastic wrap that this was in was like that of a big Ziploc bag, with the sealing zipper at the top - I thought that was pretty nice.<br /><br />I tried on this top and the sleeve length is a bit too long for my arms. If I left the sleeves untouched, they would fall past my hands. However the top fit me very nicely, a bit tight at the armpits but that's just me being too knit picky.<br /><br />I hand washed the shirt and let it surf dry overnight. I noticed that while I was rinsing and squeezing water out of the shirt a tint of red water came out as well, so I would be a bit careful if you were to machine wash it with other clothes.<br /><br />The shirt did not come laced up, I had to lace the string through myself which wasn't really a big deal. However I think the open top part, like the breast area, was a bit loose on me. It might have been because I didn't tie/lace the shirt properly before trying it on, but when I went to the sink to wash my hands I had to bend a little and the chest area flap was completely loose, showing visible cleavage.<br /><br />But overall, this is a pretty good top to have. It was not sheer at all and the fabric is better than I thought it would be. I would recommend getting this top. I got this in a size medium, for reference I'm 5'1&#34;, 34 B, and around 111 lbs."
4.0,The glass beads are beautiful but thought they might be a bit bigger.
4.0,"For a value-type faux fur, this is a lovely piece. Very soft, and feels good around your neck. because plush items can tend to slip, and not stay where they should, it's nice that this style has an opening where you can stick the other end of the scarf in. Wear it loose or more snugly. Even after many wehrungs, it doesn't matt down. It stays nice and fluffy.<br />The color is nice, it's a natural look with varying shades. It would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else. I wouldn't wash it, I think it will stay looking nice if you simply spot clean it as needed."

4.0,"Bought these for a matching family Christmas set and they‚Äôre great quality AND HAVE POCKETS!! But they run a little big, normally I‚Äôm a women‚Äôs XL in everything but the xl was huge, the large fit great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 190 pounds if it helps."
4.0,Good product at a nice price. The 'lip' of the hat can be rolled down for extra coverage. It worked well on some unseasonably cold days. Machine washable is a plus as well to make sure the hat is odor free.
4.0,"I like the practicality of the folding reading glasses and the fact that, unlike other folding glasses I'v tried, these are actually big enough to see through.  My only wish is that they came in some kind of protective case so that they do not get scratched or crushed in my purse."
4.0,Arrived as expectede
4.0,Great price for how elegant and expensive these ties look!
4.0,Just runs a little big  we will reorder but a size smaller than expectedly
4.0,"Very nice , like it"
4.0,"What can I say?  It's Maui, and I have a 5 year old grandson. Nice shirt, wish is was less $$"
4.0,I was so excited to get this because I love the tube wrap.  Disappointed to realize that only the print is a tube wrap and the others are scarfs.  The scarfs are shorter and you can‚Äôt twist or wrap as much.
4.0,"Cute little piece, great price, shipping faster than expected.."
4.0,Cute but the shirt runs small
4.0,Love them but the ankle of the pants are a little large.
4.0,It's a good product. Would recommend.
4.0,"small pull on thread,otherwise ok."
4.0,"Great hats, some a little tight for my head. Overall great look!"
4.0,"I ordered the Teal size 8 dress. The picture on my screen looks more green. I would say the dress I received is a little more bluegreen. It's a nice, light dress. I ordered size 8 in this brand for another dress that's very similar and it was actually a little bigger. This dress came a little smaller than expected. It still fits, but I guess I should have ordered a size 10. I'm 5 months pregnant and I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 140 lbs."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. It is a beautiful watch.
4.0,It was smaller than I expected. But it will still work.
4.0,was what i expected:)
4.0,"Good quality, well made. But about an eighth inch larger than my card holder so the top sticks out a tiny bit."
4.0,Too big for me but cute in general.
4.0,"I actually really liked this shirt. It was a little sheer, but not too bad. I ordered the black. I am a US med/sm and ordered a medium. Fit perfectly... UNTIL I accidentally put it in the dryer. Shrunk up so small I couldn't wear it again. Only got to wear it once. :("
4.0,Fits a little big on me and I normally get l/xl
4.0,"The dress was beautiful, but ran too small."
4.0,The smooth and stretchy fabric feels good - not too hot through the
4.0,A bit cheap looking but generally okay.
4.0,A little loose fitting around the arm puts
4.0,I really like it. It's cute and comfortable
4.0,Happy with the product but it's a bit small
4.0,Good quality but I am exchanging for a smaller size.  I'm 5'3&#34; 125 lbs and I ordered a medium based on other reviews.  It looks way too big.
4.0,I bought these because I wanted trunks about the length of 6 inch inseam boxer briefs as opposed to the usual swimming jammer which are knee length. It'd be better if the drawstring were inside the waistband although I guess it makes it more comfortable. The elastic also should be stiched into the waistband so it can't twist. I do like the material which is stretchy but yet still seems relatively heavy duty and it is lined both front and back which should help with see thru issues as the trunks get older. Note: these are low-rise cut so you'll to wear them low on the hips like the model in the picture.
4.0,"Cap is very nicely made, looks great arrived on time. Gave 4 stars because it is not met for a ladies head. It is a standard ball cap size. All the guys love it though!"
4.0,Fit well very comfy
4.0,Precio.Me queda bien.
4.0,Me encanto la tela pero quedan un poco holgados. Prefiero una talla S
4.0,"Great dress! Top is super form fitting. It's a little on the short side, but then again I am 5'8."
4.0,"Fit is too large, shoulder pads are bulky and even after washing it has a harsh chemical smell"
4.0,"I purchased this just to have a casual maxi dress to wear around the house in the summer. It's a little snug in the bust, so the pattern in the fabric stretches, and the pockets are a little high on me (I'm 6'2"" and curvy) but overall this dress is what I was looking for in terms of something comfortable and cool."
4.0,"So so so so cute! Very sturdy, and feels as if costed way more. Lol the only thing I wasn't so happy about is the color way, it's more of a dimmed down gold. It's more of a bronzey color"
4.0,More a toddler size than infant.  Good quality.  It just took forever in the shipping because label scanned to wrong zip code although correct provided.
4.0,Super cute and Comfy dress. I'm 5'1 and it goes perfectly to my ankles. Its not to tight but not to loose. Only complant is that the picture makes the dress look burgundy or maroon but it's very red.
4.0,"Hat is great, just slightly small but still wearing it proudly!!"
4.0,soft comfortable
4.0,"Fits small, but really cute."
4.0,I bought a large but probably should have gotten an XL. I gained a lot of weight this year and I'm working on fixing that. My body does better with 2 pieces because I'm pear shaped but with the weight gain a now have a tummy. The bottoms are a bit snug and the top a bit big because I couldn't get 2 different sizes for the top and bottom but I expected that. The bottoms go up high enough to hold in my tummy and the top has padding to help if you are less top heavy. This suit would fit better on someone more top than bottom heavy. Still though while I lose weight the suit will only look better. I bought a large. Great quality for only $10!
4.0,Cute hat! My daughter likes how it lights up!
4.0,I really adore the cool design on this pullover though it was quite big for my 9 year old. He truly loves this pullover also. I like that the piece came early and was just as described bright bold colors and the material was silky soft though i had imagined it being a thicker material being that its a sweater/pullover. It kind of feels like a hooded windbreaker. Overall we enjoyed this product.
4.0,"Nice dress, much better than I expected for the price."
4.0,"The spring aren't that strong, won't hurt the ear"
4.0,Nice shirt.  Very pretty.
4.0,The fit is great with a nipped in waist and very sexy high thigh slit. But the chest area isn‚Äôt as off the shoulder as I‚Äôd like. The material is very flimsy and looks easy to snag. Is a good dress for the price but likely not going to last very long.
4.0,Love it and on timr
4.0,Muy calientitas
4.0,Super cute a little long - def size down.
4.0,I like this belt and do recommend it. My only suggestion is on the release clasp which lets you loosen the belt to take it off.  It's slightly confusing.  My other 'ratchet' belts have a very simple 'lift' to loosen design.  But I recommend this seller and this product.  Never again to belts with holes!
4.0,I have size E breast and I can‚Äôt button over my girls it‚Äôs cute but for A and B maybe C cup gals no stretch at all . I can wear this size if it would stretch. Gage to my daughter in law
4.0,material is soft and the look is classy
4.0,"I have been using the bag for awhile now.  The bag works fine with some items that should be addressed.  The bag front flap works fine when hung but inconvient when free standing, rolling up the front flap maybe cute but functionalby is not there.  Secondly,  no pocket for your cell.  Finally, the zippers system can be improved."
4.0,"I love the length but wish the green was a little more popped. However, for my style they go well with many of my outfits."
4.0,I ordered both the Bunny Girl and Bunny Boy.  They were exactly as presented--very colorful and very cute.  The only reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a 5 star--the stakes were a little too short and hard to get firmly into the ground.  Otherwise--great purchase.
4.0,I had one of these keychains several years ago and was looking to replace it. This doesn't look exactly like the one I had but it was the only one I could find. I will start off by saying DGS BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. The keychain I received had a rusted keyring which had left a rust mark on the white part of the keychain. I contacted DGS about this and they got back to me right away saying they had found a better one of these keychains in their collection and had already put it in the mail for me and I could do whatever I wish with the keychain I had. All customer service should be this good. I am not sure why this costs $9 to ship though as it came in a bubble envelope and is very lightweight so it doesn't cost anywhere near that much.<br /><br />Onto the product.<br />The product doesn't look exactly like the picture as it does not have three holes at the top but two and the keyring is in one of them. I think this is fine as it looks more authentic. One thing about this is that anyone who does not do gymnastics will have no idea what this is. I feel as though it could have been a little more detailed especially the wrist part. Another thing I don't really like about this keychain is how much the white fabric seems to shed when it is rubbed but it also feels very close to the real fabric used to make bar grips.<br /><br />Overall this will probably make a cute gift for a gymnast but it could be improved.
4.0,"I am completely amazed with these fun frog sock/slippers, because they are so sofebinside my foot moves around inside and they don't stay pulled up above the ankle, they are fun to wear, warm and cozy, amazing how fun they are when you move your ankle around in them look like a real puppet trying to turn it's head or move around, I usually wear about a size 7 women's shoe and I ordered a size large however I think if I would have ordered a medium they would fit more snug to my foot. Even though I ordered them a little bit to big, I love to wear them, they keep my feet warm they are very comfortable and fun to wear."
4.0,This is a very casual shirt. Material is soft and comfy. It fits true to size. I purchased the light turquoise color. It also has light grey and dark grey. It has long sleeves with a scoop neck. This top goes good with a pair of jeans or leggings. It was priced very reasonably. I like it.
4.0,"These are okay- not exactly what I wanted. The style is wonderful but they just aren't as dark as I was hoping. My eyes are sensitive and these just don't make much of a difference for me. I gave 4 stars because product is great and very stylish, even comes with a case, but it's just not what I was looking for. I will keep them for days that aren't too sunny though!"
4.0,"although it appears as it would fit nicely, i couldnt keep as the size i requested (MEDIUM) did not fit - it seemed like it was extra small.  Also the back of the blazer did not have any lining, it looked like it was not finished."
4.0,"Wallem art done changed the design, fit and materials of their Gildan branded boxer briefs and all other brands just don't fit me right. These here shy knees branded fit great. They are much pricier than the Gildan 6-pack for half the price. But my nads are worth the okasional enduljance."
4.0,Super cute for teens.
4.0,"Very nice piece, good value; looks more expensive than it is and will be a good addition to my collection.  The 16 inch length is particularly versatile, since it can be worn with different necklines.  The unusual closure avoids the sometimes dangling piece down the back of the neck. I was pleasantly surprised by the fast delivery."
4.0,"it wont stay where it is supposed to stay, the leaf off to the side. It wants to hang in the middle"
4.0,Keeps me snug when I turn down the heat during the day at home in winter. price is right!
4.0,I gave it as a gift and the person seemed to really like it. I was able to hear some of the music while they were listening to it from a few feet away.
4.0,Bracelet not exactly as shown but it fits beautifully on my wrist.
4.0,Not as clear as picture but cute still
4.0,"Prompt shipping and such a cute top! The material isn't anything fancy, your typical polyester blouse, but it's perfect for summer. I usually wear a size XS-S top, but decided on a size M based on the sizing chart they provided. The top fits great but is a little tight in the hip area. Overall, great top for the price!"
4.0,We love being able to share our faith and support others who do the same!  The fit is also good.
4.0,I was sent the wrong color. I ordered the A with purple body and blue eye stones. I was sent the grey and green/ blue eyes. So I am disappointed and sending it back would be counter productive for the price. It is very large the body is about the size of a 50¬¢ piece and the eye a a bit smaller than a dime. If I had gotten the right color I would be estatic.<br />Update- it of course has not changed colors BUT accepting the color I got and wearing it with different outfits. I get so many compliments! It is very pretty and shiny. It does NOT look cheap.<br />I am ordering another one for my mom. She loves it.
4.0,It does the work but I made the mistake of rubbing the interior of my goggles with my towel so now they're full with scratches!
4.0,"What a fun cardigan.  Colors work well with just about anything, fun to have around.  Runs a bit small, but works fine otherwise.  The pockets are a plus!"
4.0,This was sent to a niece for her high school graduation gift and she really likes it.
4.0,"Little short, order a size up. Good quality."
4.0,Quality cheap but for the price didn't really expect top notch .925 silver
4.0,I wish the toe box was a little bigger. But they keep my feet dry when I‚Äôm trudging through snow and warm in sub zero temps. Id definitely recommend these for someone who‚Äôs looking for a good lightweight winter hiking boot.
4.0,very nice oroduct
4.0,"Beautiful color, love the veil"
4.0,Very good casual sweater. Pretty thin so won‚Äôt keep you warm with this on only. But good to have on those semi cold nights if you don‚Äôt like being to warm.
4.0,"Nice quality, midweight sock. Run a bit small so I dropped a star. They stay put on little feet. No slips or falls due to sliding on the floor. They wash well without pilling or loosening up."
4.0,Cute but a little large for what I was expecting.  My fusghtet can wear it and will grow into it and for the price it was what I was expecting.
4.0,These earrings look great and not cheap at all! They're obviously made with cheap metal though and hurt my ears.
4.0,I am happy with my choice
4.0,"I found this to be a simple men's watch, my kind of simple styling, and not packed with useless features.<br /><br />The band is a simple matte black resin/plastic.  Its comfortable on the skin, and works very well in the wet environment, as it does not soak up water at all.<br /><br />The bezel ring is fixed.<br /><br />The face is simple and easy to quickly read.  The face glows relatively well in the dark; there is no light.  Inset in the face are 24-hour indicators, which is handy.  The hands are big and easy to pick out, helping to quickly show the time.  The day/date feauture is big and clear.<br /><br />I found the single crown good, as I don't like a lot of external buttons.  This is also good for a watch advertising itself as highly water-resistant--if there are lots of crowns and buttons, that's just more opportunities for water to get into the case.  The instructions are clear and simple regarding all adjustments to the watch, using the single crown.<br /><br />The watch touts itself as water-resistant to 100m--that's a good 330 feet, more than we're going to run into at the community pool, in the shower, or taking a rafting trip.  I did some modest testing of the watch in various wet environments and have detected no leakage at all.  The user manual chart indicates that this 10-bar watch is good for hand-washing, rain, ""water-related work"" (whatever that is), swimming, windsurfing, and skin diving.<br /><br />The watch has a battery, but its primary source of power is solar, so it needs to be worn, or stored face-up in a place that is regularly getting light.  I did not run into any power problems with this watch.  There is a nice little indicator with the second hand jumping erratically that indicates a need to charge the watch.<br /><br />Paperwork: you get a lot of paper with this product, a user manual in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian, as well as a warranty card and a card a card dedicated to the solar charging.  It's all packed together very tightly, lots of info in a small space.  The English is perfect, and the graphics are clear and easily understood.  There is ample information on how to contact Casio with questions or problems.<br /><br />Price: At about $100, this seems a fair price for this item, given its features.<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is a simple, classic, and classy man's watch, a bit forward-looking in its ability to charge with light, and pretty water-resistant, to help you along with that climate change and attendant flooding.  Nice item, recommend."
4.0,I bought first time to try them.  Was really impressed.  Ordered a 2nd pack.  Good if just wise calf‚Äôs and deal with any swelling.
4.0,Very fluffy and soft.
4.0,Came in great condition and son says they‚Äôre comfortable.
4.0,"Lightweight Sweatshirt, not a heavy garment.  Sleeves are puffy and wide, cow neck hoodie.  White strings stand out."
4.0,Nice set of earrings and price was reasonable. Gave to my daughter as a gift. She was thrilled! Definitely worth it.
4.0,"super soft, however waistband is too loose but fits everywhere else"
4.0,"This is a quality shirt...especially for the price. Fairly thick materials and many nice colors. I'm 5'9"", 155 lbs with a 30"" waist and the fit is perfect EXCEPT for one thing...it's too long in the torso to go untucked which is THE style these days. I imagine if you're 5'11"" or more and have a slim athletic build, these would be perfect. A small slim fit Van Heusen never tuck shirt fits me nearly perfect, but the selection of colors is lacking"
4.0,"These are made of a very soft, slinky material. They feel a little luxurious and comfortable against the skin. And they do dry quickly. Very nice."
4.0,Material is thin.  Wear at gym.
4.0,Item as promised. It was given to my mom as a birthday gift. She loved it. Said it will be her new favorite shirt!
4.0,"Nice band, fits my S2 nicely. the paint on the bottom side of the band is wearing off though, that's usually where my wrist rests when I type"
4.0,"Very good for price.  Material is a little rough; Maybe it will soften after a few washes, but would buy again either way"
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter but ended up using them several mornings in the car when the temperatures were frigid.  The style is going to appeal, or not, depending on individual tastes so I'll tell you about functionality.<br /><br />I found them a tiny tiny bit narrow for my mom hands.  But having said that I prefer that (they weren't uncomfortable) to having them be too big.  Which is to say, a bit of stretch would be nice.  The fake fur worked very well to insulate my hand from the too-cold steering wheel and I loved that my fingers were free.<br /><br />I found these functional.  There's a thumb hole so they stay in place and they provide finger free agility and some warmth."
4.0,The locket is very pretty as is the chain. It was packaged very well and has a black velvet bag to put it in. My only complaint is that it was very difficult to clasp; the clasp was teeny tiny. Would be difficult for older people (me) and little girls (grandchild) to operate.
4.0,"runs very small. i should have ordered two sizes up! however, i give 4 stars because their customer service is great"
4.0,"I ordered this a little large, but it was was large. Mended it a bit and it was so pretty:)"
4.0,This mass was a little pricey but I liked it
4.0,"Returned item because it was too big, & did not reorder new size, ordered XL, needed L. Im usually 10-12 missy M or L top"
4.0,Great seller!! The shoes were packaged well and they fit well also. They are very stylish shoes. Thanks.
4.0,"these are a bit large because I must have lost more weight than I anticipated, otherwise they fit very well"
4.0,"They are exactly what I wanted and about the quality that I expected, however they seem to run a bit big so I ordered a half size bigger than mine to be safe and they are a slight bit too big, but they still work great, so I‚Äôd just order your actual size. The material is thin but good looking and sort of like a thin fake leather, and the soul is a very cheap rubbery material. They are great as cheap cosplay boots however the one downside is they smell very much like chemicals out of box, so hopefully that wears off other than that great product highly recommend."
4.0,"Fit my son great, will work well under his baseball uniform or as an extra layer when hunting.  He really likes this."
4.0,"Liked the style, unfortunately, they were too small, could not even zip them up, had to return."
4.0,Good for the price. But it will give you marks on nose. I didn‚Äôt have that problem with my authentic once.
4.0,"runs a tad small,  but a really pretty dress"
4.0,"The bottoms are great and fit as expected. The top fits as expected, but isn‚Äôt much of a ‚Äúpush-up‚Äù. It does have underwire but offers little support. It‚Äôs well worth the $14.99."
4.0,"The product is great but the earrings are so small, I guess smaller than what I had imagined"
4.0,Bought it for a halloween costume ans it worked well. Color was as shown. I ordered a medium and the sucker was pretty tight! I‚Äôm a 4/6 in women‚Äôs and I‚Äôm rather petite. So order a size bigger!
4.0,"This shirt seems to me very well made, well designed -- including the mesh ""breathing"" panel along the arm through to and including the underarm area -- but very heavy and probably very hot.  It is nicely seamed, well finished, nicely curved for a woman's body, and in size L good through the shoulders and not too huge through the torso.  I haven't decided yet whether to keep it  or return it -- because of the ""too hot"" factor.  But it is nicely designed and well made."
4.0,"Good enough for the price, but nothing to write home about. Has kind of a weird texture- almost papery- and a little see through, but is overall decent enough."
4.0,I have used Ryka before and they run a little small to start but stretch as they get wet and you wear them.
4.0,Received as advertised and as scheduled
4.0,Has a bit of a different look than most tank tops. Awesome breathable material.
4.0,These were favorites but eventually broke.
4.0,"Got it for my daughter, she is 11 and the large fits her perfect. Her height is 4'10&#34;"
4.0,Smaller then thought but soft and cute. Very nice to put over a dress or cute outfit
4.0,Should have followed the size chart. Runs large. Had to return to purchase two sizes smaller. I love the color though.
4.0,Looks great on but tarnished super quick.
4.0,"I like the material is not to thin, not see through at all.  colors are vibrant, very pretty dress.  I wish the waste had some stretch to it, when I sit down it gets tight and there is no stretch.  So it is a beautiful dress but can be uncomfortable at times.  If it had a bit of stretch to it I would rate 5 stars."
4.0,Arrived in the time quoted the necklace is beautiful and the earrings are comfortable to wear
4.0,"I ordered the last 11 1/2 but they sent a 10 1/2.The boot looks good and I think it would fit true to size, but they sold out of my size."
4.0,Little small but adorably cute!
4.0,"it's convenient, smart and attractive.  it's great that it's adjustable and can be cut to custom fit.  it's good quality and we know that it will withstand daily wear. we really like it!"
4.0,"I ordered the jacket in a small, my usual size and fits perfect. I paid a low price which matches the quality. But overall am happy with the purchase."
4.0,Darling. Perfect neutral to go with many outfits. Runs normal or maybe a little on the small side. Definitely size up if you are between sizes.
4.0,"Comfy, beautiful color. Wash it separately from other clothes as color will come out during first few washes"
4.0,"It worked great with the dress I'd purchased for a party.  It was a little tight in the upper arm and a little long/loose at the wrist, but tolerable."
4.0,"Good quality, very cute, solid snap closure."
4.0,I needed some more casual shirts and this one is nice. My only complaint is the XXL size is a little bit small. Usually this size fits me well.
4.0,"I soon as i got the shoes today, i was so excited. I love everything but as soon as i untie my shoes the shoe lace broke. Look like it broke or cut.( Hanging in one thread) Is there a chance to get another shoelace?"
4.0,"Adorable, for a penny?  And shipping?  Can't go wrong; also bigger than I'd expected."
4.0,"Bought these to replace a similar pair that I had for about 4 years. Quality is good,but shoes are a little wide on my feet. Otherwise satisfied."
4.0,"I bought two of these blouses, one in purple and one in white.  The purple one was terrific, but the white one didn't fit as well.  It was a little too small.  I would still give it four of five stars, though."
4.0,The romper is super cute and well made but if you have any sort of breast upon your chest think again because it won't fit. I wear a 36-B and with just a bra let it squeezed to no end. Also if you are taller than probably 5'8 I don't suggest it. I'm 5'10 and this thing went straight to wear it doesn't belong and the straps wouldn't fasten. Not for big girls at all!! I ordered an XL also.
4.0,Love this bra just one little issue with the bone to the side of the right cup (a bit pointy)
4.0,Very cute dress. Was better than expected. I wore it to a friend's wedding.
4.0,Worked like a charm! Has a funky smell for a while
4.0,"My expectations were not high, but I did expect some dimensional depth to this real hair mustache. But it's completely flat.<br /><br />PROs:<br />‚Ä¢ Looks good overall. Especially from a distance or straight on. Good for stage and impersonator use.<br /><br />CONs:<br />‚Ä¢ Completely flat and non dimensional. But still realistic enough for stage use and impersonator use settings.<br />‚Ä¢ Glue that holds the hairs together for their shape, doesn't hold very well. The first day of use it was great. But after a few uses, the hairs start coming loose from each other and getting in my mouth while still connected at the base.<br /><br />I tried spirit gum and eye lash glue and my results varied day to day."
4.0,"It can be worn casually or you can dress it up by wearing patterned tights and tall boots. It is a little plain, so I pair mine with an infinity scarf. The pockets are nice but you can't really put anything with any weight in them or it makes the dress saggy on that side. Overall, I really like it and would probably buy another or at least one that is similar."
4.0,"I was so disappointed when I tried this on and it was too tight.  I usually wear an XL and I ordered a 6X according to the sizing instructions.  It was still too small across the chest and arms.  It is a fitted shirt so if you are small, this is a perfect shirt.  On the other hand, the quality of the shirt was very impressive.  Of course, I am returning so I have not washed it to see how that is, but the material feels high quality.  The fit is more like a junior style, so if you can not wear junior clothing, this might not be for you.  This shirt would look GREAT with some leggings and boots."
4.0,"This sweater came in a vacuum sealed bag. Immediately, I washed it but that did nothing for the wrinkles. Ironing on the suggested settings also did not help the settings.<br />With that being said, I still really love this sweater. The material is thick and not typical fragile sweater material. It looks cute with jeans or leggings. I would certainly buy it in another color.<br />I purchased a size small. I'm 5'4"" and 122lbs."
4.0,"Not an original Kloud product, but I still love it. I have gotten several compliments on it. It's functional, I'm just concerned it may not last that long because it's not authentic. Even if it doesn't, I would buy another one. So far it's great."
4.0,Cool fit in car door.
4.0,It's really just what it is. A ring of silicone. The metallic silicone is pretty and it's nice to have a smaller ring option instead of something super thick.<br /><br />It will sometimes roll up your finger if you drag your hand down something. I have lost it while I've slept. I think this is just what comes with the territory if you have a smaller band width though. I'd recommend this item.
4.0,I purchased a medium as that is my usual size. It‚Äôs a little tight in the chest area but other than that it is good. I am going to keep it as I think a large would be too big.
4.0,Great fit and style.
4.0,glasses are as decribed
4.0,I love this jacket... fitted so perfect...
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and my friend loved it. It was sturdy, did not break and not cheaply made."
4.0,Top fit the way I like after being washed and dried- will order again!
4.0,"These have to be the warmest socks I own.  They are thin enough to pit in my dress shoes ,but they keep my feet nice and warm.  A little disappointed in the length as they are a little tight on my foot.  I wear a woman's 9 and my foot barely fits."
4.0,Love everything about this suit. Just wish the bottoms fit a little better.
4.0,"I got this for my young adult daughter for Christmas, and it was a big hit.  The fabric is soft, the look is super cute; definitely recommend."
4.0,Too big but beautiful
4.0,Super cute a little short on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 long legs
4.0,Really pretty bracelet but hard to read
4.0,I'm 5'9&#34; with a long torso so the romper was a little shorter than I like but it's otherwise cute and I get compliments.
4.0,"Originally ordered a medium in the tan,  it was way too big.  Returned the medium and ordered a small, it fit decent, a little loose for my taste, especially around the upper hips/belly.  It is slightly see through, I wore a beige bra and undies with it.  I also wore it with a belt I also ordered on Amazon for extra pizzazz.  Overall it turned out great for family pics.  I am 5'5&#34;, 165 lbs, and am wearing 2&#34; heeled sandals in the pic."
4.0,I love these but be extra careful with them. I have them in a lot of styles and the little balls love to fall right off. Still cute but annoying to fix
4.0,"Before I purchased this, I felt that I was kinda obligated to do some research into what sort of conditions the animals were kept in. I am not exactly a full on &#34;SAVE THE ANIMALS!!!&#34; type of person, but at the same time I don't like the idea of a living thing being treated poorly. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that for the fur of the animals to be in good condition, they must be raised properly. If they were kept in cages, their fur would be useless. So they are actually allowed to roam &#34;free,&#34; within a large fenced in area that is, but they still live a relatively normal life up until the end. In fact they often times live longer than they normally would because the farmers protect them from dangers, and they are well fed (the larger they are the more fur they give of course.) So all in all, I'm just glad I don't have to feel kinda crappy for buying the real fur opposed to the faux fur to save money.<br /><br />The quality is great also, I have only had it loose a few hairs here and there.<br />Although for the clip, I did have the tail get pulled out at one point. It was an easy fix though, just a bit of glue (I used lock tight) and I also put a screw into it for extra hold and it has been fine ever since."
4.0,Way to short but it will work for cover-up when swimming
4.0,"I really like these boots.  Because the sole &#34;feels&#34; thin (although I don't think it really is), I added a sole insert made of boiled wool.  There really is no arch support, however--in case you really need it."
4.0,I bought a size up and it fit just right. Did my leg workout in them and the white lines did stretch out but that usually happens when I deadlift and squat with my other leggings. For the price and material I would recommend especially because I didn't see any trouble with them being see thru.<br /><br />P.s: I had folded my leggings that's why they look short.
4.0,The swimsuit is cute nice color. Don‚Äôt go by measurements. I did and ordered a 3x way to big. I should have ordered a xl. I usually wear 14-16. Also it looks like someone tried it on and sent it back it had deodorant stains on it and the sticker on the bottoms wear all messed up.
4.0,"I really like these pj jeans! They are a good fit! I ordered the boot cut and they are perfect for the winter boots i wear. They even look great when not wearing boots. Very casual and very soft so you can wear them anytime, they‚Äôre just that comfortable!"
4.0,Really cute dress.  I purchased a print and a solid.  Love the print but the solid pink looks more like a nightgown.  I will still get a lot of wear from both.
4.0,Good fit.  It's a print not an embroidery.
4.0,"I'm getting older and have lost what little muscle definition I had in my youth due to health issues, so was excited to see someone was making exactly what I was looking for.  I'm on the small side (5' 7"" and fluctuate between 120-130lbs my entire adult life), so, for me, the chest pieces just feel like a little too much (almost creating the effect of something more like a woman's bustline on someone my size), but all pieces are easy to remove (presumably for washing), so I'm happy with just the padding on the arms as a little confidence boost.<br /><br />Given my size, the modern western sizing of mens smalls is often still to big for me, so usually Asian sizing is a perfect fit, HOWEVER, these appear to run QUITE small.  I understand they're supposed to fit like a ""second skin"" to wear under clothes, but the medium was honestly still REALLY snug on me.  This would have been doable, but the hem of the sleeves felt like it was strangling my arms (again, I typically take a mens small or a boys/teens 16-20 depending on the manufacturer, and my arms have honestly never been anything special even in my youth).  I was really determined to make this work, and with some trial and error (i.e.: returns/reordering), I discovered the XL is the PERFECT fit for me.  Yes, you read that right gentlemen, someone who ordinarily takes a mens XSmall-Small in US/EU sizing finds the XLARGE to be the most comfortable fit.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love this shirt and now own three (just wish they also made matching bottoms for cheeks/thighs), but for anyone larger than a medium, or who has a little meat on their arms already, I honestly don't think this sizing is made for you.  Hopefully the manufacturer may see these reviews and realize there would probably be a much larger market for these, but they need to go up at LEAST three additional sizes for the average American/European man."
4.0,Stylish shades for sure. The grey wood look is very stylish. Saw very similar oakleys for 15x the price. I lose sunglasses a lot so they aren't a big deal if I lose them. I expected them to be flimsy but they are pretty solid.
4.0,I got a big head and lots of hair
4.0,My little man isn‚Äôt walking yet but he is pulling up to stand and figured it‚Äôd be good to get him used to shoes.<br /><br />They‚Äôre super cute and he doesn‚Äôt hate them. Sometimes he tries to take them off for a minute but then I redirect him with a toy and he will forget for the rest of the day.
4.0,Arrived on time! Nice quality for little price.
4.0,"We got those for my son birthday, they are good for value."
4.0,"Fit was good, they're comfortable and stylish, and are well made with just the right mix of looseness and support. I noticed a slightly sour smell after using them daily for a number of months, but found that a trip through the wash machine cleared up the odor and they were good as new."
4.0,Great little key chain!
4.0,"Very nice belt, not as thick as the last one we had like this, but a nice belt."
4.0,"I got.this for a gift  and the recipient loves it. It looks like a cross from far off and then it's ironic when they notice it. She loves it. Decent chain, decent size."
4.0,"I really liked the look of this sweatshirt in the picture and thought it would be perfect! Sadly, it was not. I ordered the size 16-18 thinking it would be plenty big enough. It was not. I normally wear a 14/16 so order up a size. But also, the cute, comfy, slouchy sweatshirt was not what I received.<br /><br />I do like this one and think it would have worked in the warmer months but it was more silky and less cozy. And the bottom of this sweatshirt is so tight and fitted that it bunched at my waist. It‚Äôs not comfy when it‚Äôs so fitted. In the description it says it‚Äôs 70% polyester and maybe it is but there was no tag on the shirt to say materials. There‚Äôs just a small XL tag."
4.0,"very nice especially for the price, ALTHOUGH, the description is wrong.  Says 1.25&#34; or 30mm and they are actually 1.5&#34; or 35 mm.<br />Unfortunately for me I also ordered 1.5&#34; hoops the same day and now I have 2 pairs of the same size.  I would return these but they are actually nicer than the Anne Klein ones which cost more."
4.0,"They absolutely live up to the 'colorful' description. They are fairly thin and were very small on me. I wear size 11 running shoes and they don't come past my ankle. They work well as a running sock and I can't say enough about Merino wool as a material. The spandex should help them survive more wash and dry cycles than socks with a higher wool count, but it may offset the wools legendary antimicrobial properties. Time will tell on that. I do really like the fun design and colors, there is no need to wear boring socks when working out. It is just too bad they are so small that no one can see how cool they look."
4.0,"Very nice soles but grinding off the old soles and even the soles were worn through and coming off in spots, getting the rest of the soles off doing a good job of gluing on the new soles was a bit beyond me. I found a good local shoe repairman who finished it for me and I saved a bit over what he'd charge for the same soles."
4.0,"Fits nice, love it"
4.0,"I like the product it just fits a bit smaller then I was expecting. I'm still able to make it work, though!"
4.0,Looks really pretty and feels pretty sturdy
4.0,"Nice buckle. Looking forward to wearing it. The bar might have been better joined on a hinge, but the direct weld should give enough room for a nice thick belt to slip through."
4.0,I bought these for my grandson and he is hard to fit & these fit perfect
4.0,"If I could give it a 4.7, I would. I just wish it was a slightly silkier fabric. Otherwise it‚Äôs a very nice looking, very full scarf."
4.0,"Very nice bag and have received many compliments.  However, the handles are not great quality and the bright orange lining is very CHEAP.  For they money, they should have used a better quality fabric."
4.0,The medium I got fits a little looser than the first one I bought but I love these to run around in.
4.0,"Very very light weight, hanes tshirts are thicker. And the paper was stuck to the letters on the back and it took some mcgivering to fix. He is thrilled with it however, seeing how anything CA is 60and up"
4.0,Great leather not stiff very well made just not as long as I thought but still great
4.0,Fits as expected great quality for price
4.0,"Bought it for my wife, fits her excellent."
4.0,"This was the best choice for our large bridal party, however, the flower girl really wanted a button and didn't have one. Maybe consider having a flower girl/junior bride button for little girls."
4.0,"A little smaller than advertised. But I dig it, nonetheless."
4.0,"Dress fits nicely and fabric is very nice quality.  There is a slit in the back of the skirt that I didn't realize it had and it is very revealing, maybe because i'm so tall (5'8.5&#34;).  Will probably have to use a safety pin to close it a little more but other than that, I really like the dress shape and color."
4.0,Fit well not the highest quality and  doesn‚Äôt look to be 100% leather but for the price it's ok
4.0,"It‚Äôs a bit big, the watch is all over my wrist. And I don‚Äôt really have small wrists"
4.0,"The description states ""non branded"". They are branded on one side. For example, the direwolf has Winter is Coming Stark. I could have done without the large lettering! That being said they are nice but all are one sided."
4.0,"I absolutely loved this style of eyewear from Diesel. It‚Äôs a great and bold look!<br /><br />I couldn‚Äôt give it the 5 stars as I wanted because not only they run small, but the glasses are available online for a small head size.  No larger frames of this style is available from Diesel."
4.0,The display is difficult to see in almost any light.
4.0,"I love the fit on this dress!! As a 5‚Äô 1‚Äù person, the length on this dress was perfect. I‚Äôm 110lbs and got the small the size was great. The material is light, for me it got a little static-y but not too bad- and you can get away without a slip"
4.0,Great quality. But to look decent in my cartilage it's really made for the left ear. But I have gotten many compliments
4.0,Great option to a front pocket wallet. It was ‚Äútaller‚Äù then I expected but still is able to be carried in my front pocket without any real issues. The magnet to hold money is better then any others that I‚Äôve had and there is plenty of room for anything I need to carry on a daily basis. It only got 4 stars because it is ‚Äútaller than I think it needs to be but it is Ana amazing wallet and I am sure I will use it for a long time.
4.0,This Karen Scott dress fit the same as the others bought in 2016 and 2017.  It is the same smoothness and cotton content I need.  The color is not as shown.  It is a red/purple/burgundy color. I still like it  and have already worn it.  The draw back is the hat I ordered would have coordinated nicely with the color shown.
4.0,Love how the case is light weight. Got one for my son and his cousin.
4.0,"Light weight, nice color assortment, just what I was looking for.  They can be worn around the neck then pulled up for a  mask when needed"
4.0,"I like that this was able to allow me to to position the image of the skull on my face to appear to appear like a day of the dead skull and though it was a little tight on my big head, it looks great. Also I felt safer with a mask on in public! I would have worn a N95 mask on underneath this is it wasn‚Äôt so tight. IT IS VERY THIN!"
4.0,Gorgeous dress.<br />I'm 6' tall. Length comes to my ankle.
4.0,"Very cute. However, the material is very transparent. I will now be in search of a slip to wear underneath."
4.0,"I think this is medium size for adult woman.  It fit for my mom, but my head is large for normal hat always, so it is too small for me.  The quality of the hat is not so high, it is just like ones that we find from cheaper gift store, however considering the price, it met my expectation.  We might use it for outside event type thing on the cooler day.  The facecover is removable, so we can use it just like a normal hat, too."
4.0,Good but too thin
4.0,true to size and sometimes I forget I‚Äôm wearing boots! They are the most comfortable shoes I‚Äôve even worn. They are a thin leather material so they won‚Äôt last forever but very stylish.
4.0,"Overall, I wore these out of the box all day with no blisters and only minor discomfort. I had tried a Michael Kors shoe that was similar, but has a much pontier toe. To me, this ended up being a much more attractive shoe. The color is closer to a light taupe, but still in the neutral category. I bought these to ho with a navy suit - looked professional."
4.0,Love the cotton.  Well made quality clothing..  Reminds me of when I was young and every year get new nighty night..
4.0,"Very comfortable casual Jersey material. Rouching is flattering although I did deduct a star because it is a bit loose around my tummy area and it sags a little making it look like I have more of a ""gut"" than I really do. Dress hits mid ankle and the slit goes to mid thigh.<br />I am 5'6"" 148lbs 36D for reference, and ordered a Med."
4.0,"Upon arrival. I loved the boot ! It was exactly what I  expected. However, the boots were a little too small. The seller was helpful in allowing me to the return the shoe."
4.0,"I‚Äôm usually a M or L in dresses, and definitely could have gotten a M in this dress. It was really cute and super comfortable, but the white one was completely see through."
4.0,Super cute print and nice thick fabric with just the right amount of volume for me without a petticoat. I only returned it because the elastic back bunched the fabric in a strange way over my backside. Perhaps it was just a bit large.
4.0,"Very cute, came in a case and protective drawstring sack."
4.0,Pretty dress. Fits close to size.
4.0,"I like the colors, I like the height of the sock, they don‚Äôt travel around your foot"
4.0,I dislike  about this shoe they look cheap
4.0,I am 120lbs I usually wear a small but I bought a medium the top fits great but the bottom is way to small!
4.0,Flattering and fits well.
4.0,This item was pretty cute but i wish the necklace part was closer to the neck.
4.0,Love it but did have it break the first time I wore it. Just needed to use my jewelry pliers and it is back on my wrist.
4.0,"Nice weight - keeps me warm but, not too hot at night like a flannel or fleece gown would be."
4.0,"Very cute but bunny comes off too easy, my 1 year old pulled one bunny off very easily"
4.0,"It's thin material so can wear it all year round, comfortable and beautiful."
4.0,Just like everyone else the strap is too short. Hard to fasten
4.0,Good product. Just as described and great for use
4.0,"I got them a day early. They were all there, the gems were all there. The studs are the perfect length. I like the colors. The only thing I didn't like was that the gems are a bit big."
4.0,"Very classy, however the material is already running after one day of wear. I ordered a medium 5 ft 130lbs. The colors are navy blue and tan."
4.0,The shoes are very nice although somewhat heavy. I ordered a size 2.5 because another review said that her child who was a size 1 fit perfectly in them. But the 2.5 were huge so I returned them and ordered a size 1 which is what my 5 year old wears. When they came the tag inside said they were a US size 5.5 so needless to say the were way too big for my child. I will try a size 12 now.
4.0,Stinky feet
4.0,"Not nearly as cheap-looking as I thought it would be from the price and reviews--my husband has gotten into ordering similar jewelry for me from this one discount Chinese auction site, so I pretty much knew what to expect.  I can't wear the ear-rings because they *did* turn out to be pierced, and my ears are not pierced, but other than that, the necklace is pretty and about the right length.  Ruby is my birthstone, so I wanted a better-looking imitation ruby necklace than what I had (I have other ruby clip ear-rings and other jewelry.), and this does fill the bill."
4.0,My daughter needed a set of these shorts for volley ball.  She loves them.  Says they are a great fit and really comfortable.
4.0,"Like the bracelet - looks good.  I was able to work the clasp one handed.  It was a bit snug, but I have a larger wrist."
4.0,No Buttons. Requires a camisole to be worn in public. Chiffon is a sheer fabric typically made of silk or nylon. The shirt has a pleat at front and split round collar. Attractive style and fit as expected.
4.0,The fabric is really fun!  The sleeves I tucked under to make it into a sleeveless dress and then it's very cute!
4.0,"Quality was good, got very tight to wear as a gaiter in a warm climate or while hiking."
4.0,Very cute. Metal key ring and clasp feel inexpensive would be my only complaint.
4.0,"Elastic at waist was a bad idea, should've been a draw-string. Other than that, I like these pants. They're unique to my area & lifestyle, and feel quite playful. Glad I have them."
4.0,So far so good. Seems to hold up pretty well. I even biffed it on a couple of rocks and it still holds. I have size 13 feet so the booties on the xl ran a little small but not unusable.
4.0,Even tho it didn't fit me i love the material so i gave it to my fren she love it an it fits her well
4.0,"This is a beautiful shirt for summer, great quality and has lace on the back that adds style to the shirt. It is not see through at all and the armholes don't show my bra or anything, so there is no need to wear anything under it. It does run large, usually I wear a large or extra large but I ordered this in a medium and it fits perfect. Which is great because I think any bigger and it would look huge on me. It also comes with a sash that you can tie around your waist to make a tighter fit if you like. This is a great option to have different looks with this shirt.<br /><br />*****I have been ordering from this company for a long time and one thing I have learned is that if you follow the measurements under the product description and order according to that, you will have a great fit."
4.0,Good shirt for the money. The material is scratchy though and the choker bit of material is very loose. Bust 42 /waist 34 /hips 40 and the XL is a little bit snug but I  like fitted tops and I'm sure the material will relax a little. The arms are tight though.
4.0,Seems decent quality..
4.0,They served the purpose for my 2 year old's Spiderman costume. His fingers were not quite long enough to reach the end of the fingers. But he still loved them. If you pull to hard they may rip.
4.0,"Really cute skirt. But definitely runs small. If you have big hips or butt, keep in mind it will cling towards the top then flare out. I'm returning the large and trying the XL to see it's any better."
4.0,"SO CUTE!  I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it, however, it's a little small. I knew I was taking a gamble on the fit but decided to chance and it's wearable with a tank under it. I'm a size 12 and a  36DDD. Oh, and just a heads up, I also get snagged on EVERYTHING when I wear it so its lost a little of it's fullness because the fuzzies come off. Still cute tho"
4.0,very cute for my hubby's birthday!!  nice quality
4.0,"I suggest ordering a size larger.  Also, fabric doesn't stretch."
4.0,Very cute and seems sturdy enough to last. Glad it came on time.
4.0,"The Power Balance Bracelet is perfect for my granddaughter athlete.  I bought similar bracelets for her siblings to enjoy, also."
4.0,"I bought these to cover up my cleavage on some low cut blouses. I used one for a family dinner and found myself having to adjust it all night because it kept slipping down. Guess the weight of my melons was too much for it. So I still wear a bra underneath because they don't provide any support whatsoever, but they are pretty."
4.0,The color/pattern blu 003 is pretty and made well.  Fabric feel good on.  I have other Amazon dresses that the empire waist is a little lower. This one was too high for me and looked funny on me.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 142 lbs - 34dd size M.  I could have worn small except in the chest. Hope that helps.
4.0,Runs small. Nice quality shirt.
4.0,"Came with all the parts needed to remove the links, which is awesome because I can now do it myself for future watch bands. Thanks for that?<br />Giving a four star because for me, it can only be too lose or too tight. If there was an adjustable pin where the clasp is, it would be perfect.<br />Other than that, solid craftsmanship, good quality, good finish, functions well.<br />Would buy again."
4.0,This bra is very soft and good for sleeping in it. It gives VERY limited support though and runs somewhat small.
4.0,"thanks, Nice. But the tiny necklace ."
4.0,"They are good but i have had three  blinds fall off but the tabs stayed in their place, still hanging while the blind fell. So the glue on these are good but they can give and not hold eventually, all my others have held so far. Now let me tell you that  my blinds are in front of a window that has wind going through them  and i'm wondering if the wind going through the blinds is what is helping them fall off by the blinds moving so much. make sure once on to press the tab into the blind well to make sure all is strongly connected."
4.0,The glasses are great! Multiple pairs allow me to set them around so I always have a pair wherever needed!! Stylish frames and low price!
4.0,"Super cute but should of gotten a size bigger! I am 120 lbs and 5'7. I bought a size small i think because of the size chart but should of gotten a medium. It still fits perfectly though, just shows a little more cleavage than i had imagined it would."
4.0,I really loved the look of these earrings for my daughter unfortunately she lost them the first week. I‚Äôm not sure how. I‚Äôll have to order them again for myself to see how theY perform
4.0,It is a really pretty lace trim top! The shipping was fast too. However their version of &#34;plus&#34; is likely a standard American size 16/18. It does have some give (spandex) and I could wear it but not comfortabley.  I kept the top and gave it to my daughter who wears a women's 12/14.
4.0,I like it because it roomy enough for my needs.
4.0,"It was definitely small and I had some difficulty putting in a picture, but overall it was a good purchase. My mom loved it and since it isn't that big, she can wear it daily. Plus, the material doesn't make her skin itch, which gives this another point in my book. I just wished there was a better way to put a picture in there."
4.0,And unusual (which I like) but heavy
4.0,They are better for walking around the house than they are for Pilates. They need more non-stick material and they need a tighter connection to the foot; they can slip off when using equipment.
4.0,buen producto y entrega
4.0,Love this hat. It is warm. I have a similar hat where the entire inside has fleece. I thought this would be the same but it isn‚Äôt.
4.0,"I ordered this suit in size xl. I am 5'6&#34; tall and 172lbs. the length, fabric, removable bra padding was great. Unfortunately I have a larger bottom and this suit was too &#34;cheeky&#34; for me. Also, the scallops seemed to fold under some. I am sending it back because of the lack of butt coverage."
4.0,"Great quality but sizing is incorrect, order one size bigger than normal..."
4.0,Looks and works fine.<br />The release took awhile to get used to so practice with it before you really need to get it undone.
4.0,"I love the colors on this thing. They are bright and you can wear this with just about anything. I like that it just slips on and off, no clasping. Clasping a bracelet on oneself can be tricky at times. The makeup is like beads and spacers on a stretchy fishing-line-type string, but it's sturdy. It doesn't feel as though it's going to snap off and break. I've been tugging on it and whatnot and it's holding.<br /><br />I have a metal allergy, which makes buying cheap jewelry difficult at times, but there's no metal on this, though the spacers look like it; they aren't. So this is a great bracelet for that person who's allergic to metal. *Upon reading the item description, I discover it has sterling silver. That must be those pretty spacers. This is okay for me.*<br /><br />The only con: it's a bit snug. I think it would better suit somewhat with a very small wrist--perhaps a teenager? But I'm going to wear it anyway. It's not tight to the point of discomfort.<br /><br />I received this via Amazon Simple."
4.0,"the opening is kind of big but was able to bend it in so they don't hang on ears funny, very pretty."
4.0,"This is such a pretty bag. However, one reviewer stated that the red is a brownish red which is why I purchased it. It's a red bag, no brown in it. I'm not a fan of red bags, so I'm returning it and getting the brown. This bag doesn't look cheap, looks more than what you actually paid for it."
4.0,"For those among us cospalyers, great costume! I used RIT synthetic dye to try and dye it yellow. It DOESN‚ÄôT soak up that dye well. Just be aware when you buy this. But the costumes is very nice quality, very cute as well. I will still wear and figure out a way to get it darker."
4.0,Love it.  Words are a little hard to read but still love it.
4.0,They look good and the correction seems to be accurate. I can see fairly clearly. They are indeed polarized. I just wish they can be a little darker. If there's a mirrored version I would prefer that.
4.0,These are really nice sunglasses and do exactly what I wanted them to do. As a petite female I am always looking for glasses that do not look huge on me and actually stay on my face. Many times I resort to youth sizes in hats and glasses. Recently I had cataract surgery and needed a pair of polarized glasses. I purchased a few pairs and these are my favorite. I would have given them a 5 star if they came a little bit bigger as the bridge is just a little narrow. After a full day of wear my nose and side of head did hurt. Please carry them in a bigger youth size. Thanks
4.0,"My only compliant is that the tie-back loop to hold the mitten portion back slips off often.  Otherwise they are very comfortable, warm and not overly bulky."
4.0,Good:  super cute.  My favorite print of all 15 bathing suits I own.  Flattens/conceals yourntummy really well!<br /><br />Bad: its a bit high cut for my taste.  But thats just me. I prefer a full bottom.<br /><br />Super cute.
4.0,These were what I was expecting from the reviews. Seem cheap but get the job done (keep my hands warm).
4.0,These are so much easier than carrying around extra tools.
4.0,I ordered this to try for a wedding in a couple of prints/patterns. I did notice that the blue/green floral is more of a polyester feeling fabric while the &#34;brown&#34; is more thin cotton. I liked these but they were a little too casual for my event and looked a little frumpy....
4.0,"Ordered a medium..I'm  5'4..166lbs. I needed a little more flow, so I reordered a large for a better fit and a little more off the shoulder action!!!üòú Material light and cool ..not too thick, but not a bad thing. They need more colors in this!!!"
4.0,It fit just like the picture.
4.0,Only problem I have with this Bracelet is that some of the silver strands are fraying
4.0,Very stretchy. Didn't like the shiny material but that's just my preference. Very fitted to show all your curves.
4.0,"So, for the most part I was pretty pleased with this costume. For the price and the fact that I didn't have to make any modifications to it. I am 5'7"" 140lb, and I ordered the small/medium. It was a little on the snug/short/revealing side, but that was part of the goal. The top was VERY SMALL... I was able to wear the flesh colored ""chicken cutlets"" to help boost up the girls. But I was constantly adjusting, and they showed a little.  The leg tie would not stay up at all, but I managed to get it on for the pic at least!"
4.0,So cute and comfortable for kids to wear.
4.0,Worked as advertised no problems
4.0,"The bracelet is very beautiful. The stone is bright, and the chain is small but strong. Fits perfectly. It would be great gift. It adds that extra to your outfit."
4.0,"I think I would rate these a 5, but only got to use them once so far & it was not a heavy work day. I think I'll be ordering more though, as they fit very well & seem to be good quality.<br />I'm happily surprised!"
4.0,"We used them during GNYEM ( NY DENTAL SHOW) Nov, 2021. They are cute looking and easy to use."
4.0,Nice fit sleek no thumb covering though. Just an opening. Not for really cold temps only for cool weather. Quality knit fabric. Not microfiber.
4.0,"I like the watch. It's durable, and the simple design is nice. My only complaint is that there weren't any instructions on how to change the settings."
4.0,"The item seems more like poncho with no sleeves. But it's great for cold weather and snow. Recommend wearing a jacket,a light coat or sweat shirt underneath it. But it keeps you warm and is rather stylish. Goes good with scarves."
4.0,"This was a birthday gift for my wife. We are ""young thinking"" and active seniors ... I have seen young people with bracelets like this one and my wife loved it as well. She has received several compliments on it at social functions in the short time she has owned it."
4.0,"I love this shirt. I ordered a medium thinking it ran small (I'm normally a small, 5 1' and weight 125 pounds) but the medium is a bit too baggy.  Definitely still wearable but I think going with my true size would have been better.  I did decide to order it again in a small just to see the difference and ordered the orange color too! The material is thin but it's a nice material, drapes nicely and it's comfortable. The shoulders are elastic but unlike some off the shoulder elastic tops that don't stay, these stay in place really well even when you move/lift your arms.  Check out the pics I posted.  I just took it out of the bag so it might look a little wrinkled in the pics."
4.0,Good product but sizing chart is not accurate.  Runs very large based on the measurements
4.0,"Good quality, just large."
4.0,Nice bra for the price.
4.0,I like it a lot. but doesn't fit right... so I will give to my niece.
4.0,If you have a tiny waist and a bigger chest the buttons pull.
4.0,This is a very pretty shirt it was a little big for me but it still looks good. It will match with a lot of things too.
4.0,"I love these sunglasses. Arms are thin but not an issue for me. My one complaint is that the blue mirrored ones seem to have a flaw in the lens. After 1 day out in the sun, the finish seems to be cracked which makes them (unfortunately) unwearable now because the ""cracks"" interrupt the vision. Overall a good pair though. I would just be weary of the mirrored lenses."
4.0,Nice casual bag.
4.0,FLATTERING SHAPE. GOOD COLOR AND TINT.
4.0,Very nice... cute skirt ... fits welll
4.0,Bought a medium - my size. Nice tank top but runs small and a bit on the short side.
4.0,I absolutely LOVE these boots! The only reason I gave it a four star was because they fit a little snug. That's usually the case with boots so I ordered a size up and they just barely fit.
4.0,"Love these, but sometimes the right lens will pop out. Happened on the first day, which isn‚Äôt great, but I am (so far) able to get it back in when it happens. Otherwise they‚Äôre durable and look and fit well, and have already withstood substantial use by a three year old."
4.0,"So cute. Got a lot of compliments on it.<br />My only request would be wider sleeves, they are a little tight. If a lady is ordering xl or xxl the sleeve should be a little wider."
4.0,Ears are great but no way could I squeeze my ears into the hole. It is way too small.<br />I pinned them to my hat and it looks great.
4.0,Got a few of these for fall/winter field work in desert. I like them. Also great for lounge or casual errand running. Good buy.
4.0,"Chic beautiful earrings. I love how big they are because I LOVE statement earrings. However, one of my earrings came with a small area of discoloring on it."
4.0,"The tank top and headband fit great, short are HUGE! They slide right off my daughter. Oh well, the tank top is cute"
4.0,The fit is great...I love how comfortable it is...but I wish the brim wasn't quite so wide.
4.0,Easy  to wear and comfortable.  Belt buckle is thicker than  it needs  to be as is the width  of the band.
4.0,Have to shorten quite a bit and haven't worn them yet.
4.0,"I like these shorts, they fit great but I wish they came up higher than they do. Not all women should wear mud waist shorts."
4.0,"This night gown is beautiful!  It's sexy in an elegant and demure way.  The fit is excellent along with the length that is about 5 inches below my knee (I am 5'4"").  The top portion sensually cradles the bosom and gives a peek of some cleavage.  The only reason I deducted a star is because the lace part of the top sort of got itchy after a while -- but it might just be me, I am quite sensitive to any lace or trim on my night gowns."
4.0,More of a stretchy material than a stiff one so sometimes rose up as I walk.  But pretty nice dress for what I needed it to be
4.0,Great! It‚Äôs like AirPods but cheaper!
4.0,These were nice .
4.0,"I love this bracelet. I received this as a gift from my husband, I wear it everyday and aside from the slight snagging I've had on my shirts( the material of the shirt didn't really help) I'm pretty pleased with this item. My only complaint is that it is advertised as stainless steel but really is just a steel overlay, I wouldn't typically complain about that but I have allergies to certain metals and also because the silver color is wearing off and it has a copper color showing through. Over all it's a really nice part of my everyday jewelry."
4.0,My daughter is 7 and she usually wears a size 11 so that's what I ordered. We tried it on her and it was way too small. We returned it and got a 12 and that was perfect! The strings are stretchy and we found those annoying. They are too long and come out too much after tucking them in which makes them hard to go outside and play in the snow with them. She tripped over them a lot.
4.0,"It runs a little small, but other than that quality is good and I loved the skull necklace gift :)"
4.0,IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.  JUST A BEAUTIFUL PENDANT.  I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE CHAIN AS IT CAME IN A SMALL PACKAGE AND I AM HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE CHAIN TO ALL LAY FLAT.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS KINKS IN IT.  HAD TO TAKE OFF A STAR FOR THAT.
4.0,I bought it to wear to Church on the Sunday before my birthday. It fit beautifully.... but I ordered 2 sizes up. I‚Äôm normally between a large and XL because I have a small upper body and big hips. I bought a XXL.... I received many compliments on the color and the fit.
4.0,"This blazer is perfect for warmer weather. The lace weave allowed great circulation without locking in the heat like traditional blazers.<br /><br />The lace is extremely striking and I get compliments every time I wear it!  My only complaint is that because the lace is sort of embroidery-like, the tears can snag on things easily and have a large, fuzzy pilling effect. Snip the fuzz off with a pair of scissors and it's good as new though.<br /><br />I wear this to work but you could easily pair it with a dress or skirt and wear to a wedding or am evening out.  Definitely worth the price!"
4.0,"It's cool just like the original 80s watch. But it's smaller than I remember, almost like a kids size. Maybe it's  just seems that way cause I'm bigger now. The light is dull just like I remember lol.  For $12 it's a fun nostalgic piece to own. Lightweight so feels like you're not even wearing it which I like cause I don't wear jewelry or watches much. Casio even put it in a nice box and holder which I didn't expect for the price."
4.0,"Overall, I would say these exceeded my expectations for how comfortable I thought they would be, and the only downside is that they have a limited number of uses before you need to replace them. This is probably fine if you are purchasing them for special occasions only but something to be aware of if you are looking for something to replace a bra or to wear for an entire season, etc.<br /><br />Firstly, they are very easy to put on and not at ALL noticeable under even just a t-shirt...which I found kind of mind-blowing. They are super comfortable and I forgot I was wearing them after ten minutes of them being on.  I find bras really uncomfortable and hate wearing them so for me I was testing these out as an alternative. They definitely meet my needs and expectations. I would say I got about about a weeks' worth of use from them (daily use, 8-10 hours each day) before the sticky had worn off on the back, especially around the edges--which is important to adhering fully and not falling off or hanging off, etc :) If you wanted to be safe they probably only have maximum stickyness for 2-3 days of use. But if you can afford it or just need it for a special occasion they are great!"
4.0,"very good , however it does not adjust very wide."
4.0,I love the back but the front comes up really high on the waist
4.0,"I've been wearing this for about a month so far, and haven't had any problems with it at all. It's a cute little hoop, real sterling silver too."
4.0,Wear it every day and haven't had issues.
4.0,Really nice would recommend.
4.0,Fun design. The lenses are on the dark side.
4.0,"Great price, comfortable and cute."
4.0,This is a great dress and the material is super nice however the pockets are really high and one was sew too small. The shoulders and chest area are little right as well but otherwise very nice.
4.0,"Beautifully sparkly. I bought this as a gift to child who recently had her ears pierced. She LOVED the earrings and has had no allergic reaction, after wearing them continuously. Nice product, good packaging and speedy delivery."
4.0,"I love the color, flexibility & idea of this band. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt fit the Apple Watch Series 7 snugly/correctly. There are large gaps above & below the watch band on the back side. It does cover up some of screen & it prevents the Digital Crown from turning. Hopefully they will make a newer version to fit the series 7 soon."
4.0,The necklace fine.
4.0,The color had a lot of orange in it.
4.0,I got beige? But I'm not mad because that's probably more useful with outfits
4.0,Looks good and fits ok. Good material so far. I'm satisfied with it.
4.0,"This is an amazing jacket, however there is no pocket on the front - deceiving!"
4.0,"This parka works great for leaving the pool without having to shower and get dressed at the facility. With all the new restrictions (due to the Coronavirus), the facility has requested a quick exit. I purchased this so my Son can just toss this on and go. It mostly works great. I have a little problem with the zipper. It works perfectly on the hanger, however; any kind of tension well trying to zip, will cause it to go askew. My suggestion is to leave it zipped at the bottom and pop it on. Otherwise, we love it!"
4.0,This came very fast and is super cute love it
4.0,I enjoy this product a bit. Has plenty of space inside.  I was able to fit all my gear in it plus 3 or 4 days worth of emergency food just incase.  It is very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time walking and hiking  I would tell anyone to invest in this.
4.0,Nice silky athletic material. Not see through at all. Ran a little big so they're not the yoga tight legging type thing I was going for.
4.0,This is a great quality top. It‚Äôs a little shorter than I‚Äôd like but overall it‚Äôs nice.
4.0,Great material. Flattering cut. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and it was perfect length and flow
4.0,"When I received this Hynes Victory Sweet Ladies Tote Handbag, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a nice size, and I love the off white color. It has a total of 6 compartments to put things in. It has 2 smaller pockets on the inside which are perfect for putting smaller things or a cellphone. There is a zipper pocket in the middle which opens up to a large pocket. I like to keep some bigger things in there that I want to keep separate like make up, or medicine. Then there is another zip pocket which when zipped up can be locked with a little lock. All you have to do it pull on the lock to open it. I keep my wallet and anything else that I want to keep out of a pick-pocketer's reach. There is no way they are going to be able to pull the lock down, take it off and unzip the purse without me knowing it. Nice little sense of security.<br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would have bought this item or a similar item no matter what. I do not get anything in return for leaving a 5 star review. I know a lot of people seem to get upset by these reviews because they think people who get items at a discount just leave 5 stars and don't care. That is not the case. These sellers are new businesses and need to get their products out there. They need to get people to try them so they can see what works and what doesn't. I have discovered a lot of great new companies and products because of these opportunities. I have left plenty 1 or 2 star reviews with my honest thoughts. I rely heavily on other people's opinions when purchasing items online, and I hope this review helps you. Please feel free to contact me to ask any questions you may have. I would be happy to help you."
4.0,"I got a large it‚Äôs alittle too big in the top and pretty good in the bottom, the top padding is one long piece so it‚Äôs easier to straighten out but if it‚Äôs big on you like it is on me the center can poke out a little bit<br /><br />It also took about a month and a half to show up"
4.0,"These are really fun for a birthday party.  My daughter had a birthday party at the Pump it Up (the glow party, where they turn the lights off), and we handed these to the kids.  It was a hit.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the rubber bands kept falling off or stretching, so that was annoying, but luckily, with 40 lights, we were replacing broken ones with the new ones."
4.0,"When I was purchasing those shorts, I thought they were made from elastic material that would sit nice and tight on your body. When the shorts came and I tried them on, they definitely were made from a nice material, but I didn‚Äôt get the right tightness that I wanted. I ordered size M and they were a little bit loose. I still love them though!"
4.0,He loves jewelry no complaints at all.
4.0,"It's a very sexy vintage accessory. The chain is adjustable, so it will fit any wrist. I bought one for my wife to wear with dresses and I love it."
4.0,"At Machu Picchu, it rained on and off the whole day. It was fairly easy to keep putting this on and packing it up. It was a little warm, wish it had more ventilation, but it did the job and packs away real small."
4.0,"So first let me say that this dress is super duper cute...and it's pretty spot on to the main picture.<br /><br />(There is another picture that has black ruffles on the bottom and it doesn't have that.)<br /><br />But my reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a bit small. Going by the Yucun Size Chart the 2XL should have fit perfectly. However, it's just a bit tight in the chest region and for whatever reason the arm holes are too small so it digs in under my armpit. In most everything else I'm a size 16 so that's slightly disappointing. However, if you're a slightly smaller girl or you don't have swimmer shoulders/arms you will probably be just fine. I have a friend who is just a tiny bit smaller then me and it fit her amazingly. The dress seems well made and hits perfectly at the knee.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend getting the dress, just be sure to double check sizing with the Yucun Size Chart which is one of the images.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Fit was way to small for me (hat size 7 1/2) but it fits my 5 year old great! He loves the hawks too so his gain I guess.
4.0,Looks nice but does wear down quickly my ex-wife wore it for about two days and it‚Äôs already rubbing off the paint.
4.0,I can't wait to wear it
4.0,The shoes look exactly like the picture and they fit as expected. The issue I have is that the bottom of the shoe is very slippery. I slid on hard wood flooring my first day several times. Also they tend to bend on the sides as well.
4.0,"I loved the color and feel of the fabric! I had ordered a long sleeve version of this top a few month ago that I love so I ordered the sleeveless one for summer, unfortunately the buttons seemed to pull in the chest area and going up a size would be too big so I returned it. Long sleeve version washed well."
4.0,I like it I only wore it one time for Halloween 2019. It was cold that night but my legs wasn‚Äôt cold at all. I do have thicker thighs and caves so it went over my knees but it rolled down.
4.0,Very comfortable and can coordinate with other tops.
4.0,"Very nice, very spacious and sleek looking."
4.0,"A solid 1 CTW moissanite for this price? unheard of. Yeah, the chain is a bit on the thin side....but, I got a tad thicker chain, and threaded it through several of the side holes, and it lays beautifully in the hollow of my throat without 'flipping' around. love it. it's everything I wanted."
4.0,Very cute but the olive is a bit on the yellow side and it does tend to burst open if you actually fill it up so not sure if I would reccomend for a wedding ceremony (what I used it for). Good for just some fancy evening thing and I like the chain that comes with ti
4.0,"I'm 5'8 so the socks barely go passed my knee, but they are still soo cute and comfy, they dont slip down and they arrived at a perfect time! I only gave 4 stars because they dont go to my mid thigh like I thought but I'm super happy with my item :)"
4.0,Elegant and it's exactly what I'm looking for.
4.0,"Baby loves these shoes. Easy to put on, light and stylish."
4.0,Its a hat and fits on your head.
4.0,Lots of little fur balls. It's to be expected. Very nice.
4.0,Love them except the elastic band has a tendency to roll.
4.0,Very cute top. TTS. Unfortunately got a wine stain that won‚Äôt come out on it so had to throw it away.
4.0,Love this dress because it has pockets. It is also super comfy. The only complaint that I have is the fact that there is no tag in the dress so I find difficulty figuring the front of the dress from the back. Please add a tag!
4.0,"I got a medium for my husband who is 5'9 and it fit him fine but wasn't as billowy. I think the large would have billowed more, so I suggest maybe sizing up.  I'm 5'1 and could wear the medium too but it ""billowed"" around me for a fuller effect.  I think the quality was awesome and it's velvety all around. My kid kept hugging it like a stuffed animal lol. I took a photo of it on the chair."
4.0,"At first I LOVED this bag and I truly wanted to love it but unfortunately I just can‚Äôt and it‚Äôs going back.  I really liked the simplicity of it and the smooth quilting, the iridescent dark silver hardware is beautiful and the shape and size are perfection.  However, it has no inside pockets and I find that necessary for my phone/lip gloss.  The main reason it‚Äôs going back though is because of the strap - it‚Äôs a one complete strap design so when the bag is filled and on the shoulder and I need to get in it I have to remove the bag completely.  If I just flip down one strap and open it the weight of the bag pulls it down to a crossbody length.  Unfortunately for me that was super inconvenient bc I need to be hands free sometimes.  If that doesn‚Äôt bother you I‚Äôd say go for it!  It‚Äôs cute."
4.0,"This shirt has a very soft feel, but I can see that it is starting to form tiny little pills after less than five washes."
4.0,I purchased this as a replacement for a money clip that never had cash. I like the layout and the clear window.<br /><br />I reallly hate the magnet though. I almost never have cash on me and the super strong magnets are obnoxious. The magnet constantly attaches to my keys and/or pocket knife. If I carry cash it'll be inside the pocket and not with the magnet.<br /><br />If they ever make one in a similar style sans magnet clip I would totally buy it.
4.0,"Charger works well, however the band is a bit tight / small side. Connection between the band and the fitbit is also a tad difficult to release compared to oem."
4.0,Not used to this concept so it took some getting used to wearing sunglasses at night.
4.0,"Fit fine, not too heavy."
4.0,Look as advertised but will not stay up on ear lobes as crawlers should.
4.0,"The fabric is quite itchy, especially around the armpit area. Had to return. I'm sure it's not bad if you're wearing a few times here and there for a special occasion."
4.0,"Not quite what I was expecting, but still like them."
4.0,"First off, lets be clear: this is not a mask. Several reviews have mentioned doubling it up for respiratory protection. No. The fabric is porous and cannot be used to stop particles from passing through. It might be okay as a barrier while riding a bike, but there is no significant breathing protection. It has, however, been a great bandana and gaiter. I've been using this while in kayaking class and as a hair wrap when I'm around the house. Very happy with this product for those reasons. I did receive two, one black and one white.<br /><br />The elastic band is the perfect tension to wear around my head. Tight enough that it doesn't move out of place, but not so tight that my head hurts. It goes over my head and can rest on my neck easily. It can either cover my hair from the front or I can pull it up from the back of my neck and use it as a gaiter or as a sort of balaclava-like covering.<br /><br />The smooth texture of the fabric does not pull on my textured hair, and I could probably use this to sleep in if I didn't already use a silk pillow case. This would be a good travel ""bonnet"" if you have need for such a thing. I'm happy with the purchase, and I hope that the seller changes the description to better represent what this is, and what it isn't."
4.0,"It ran a little small, bu will keep it."
4.0,great product  would buy again next time maybe one size bigger
4.0,"it's a mens sweater so it definitely fits big on a woman, I bought this because I feel a grey hoodie is a staple. it's comfortable, warm, and can be dressed up or down. good quality, but I wish I bought a size small"
4.0,Cute top! It‚Äôs a little short for those who are taller. Doesn‚Äôt look cheap!
4.0,These earrings were a little bigger than I expected but they were still beautiful and looked great.
4.0,I always have a hard time finding clothes online that actually got the way they were supposed to! This dress fit exactly how it was supposed to! I was so excited!
4.0,VERY pretty... it does tend to slip off the ear from time to time...
4.0,I don‚Äôt like the sun on my face. This product is for me when I‚Äôm exercising outside.
4.0,Super cute... A little big (but I have small wrists).
4.0,"Beautiful design but didn't flatter me because I'm only 5'2&#34;. If you're taller, I think this would be a stunning fall/winter jacket!"
4.0,This sweat shirt has a nice fit  and looks good too. this was a christmas present for someone else I am glad I purchased it.
4.0,Runs a little small. Shape-wear required.
4.0,Cute and bright print!the pants are a little snug and might be tight for someone with higher weight percentile
4.0,"I had bought this dress twice, because the first one although it fit it was a little tight even though I had ordered one size up than what I usually wear, so I returned it and went another size up. The dress is made very well, some real quality work and material, overall I was very pleased with it.  The blouse is okay, the material is a stiffer cotton, and has many wrinkles. The apron could have been sewed together a little better as it started to separate on one section, but not a big deal.  The only thing about the dress that could use improvement is the arm holes. Getting your arm in or out is a little hard with the dress being so fitted, and no stretch in the material, so while putting the dress on is okay, getting out of it is a bit hard without help, due to the small armholes. The embroidery on the dress though is very beautiful, so it is definitely worth getting, but if you are a larger size, the armholes may prove difficult when trying to get out of it."
4.0,"I bought this in white and it's a very cute top. However, I can tell from the fabric that this is NOT a workout top. I was really looking for some long sleeve tops for the gym, but this will definitely not wick away sweat like I hoped; I'm not even going to try to wear it to lift in because I'm a sweaty gal and I don't want to have giant pit stains. Still, it fits really nicely and looks great, although the material is quite thin. Makes a cute yoga/lounging top but I probably won't use it for much more than that."
4.0,"In many ways, this could have been the perfect Bible for me. The design is elegantly understated, the paragraph format is a pleasure to read (and makes it challenging to return to the cramped, dual-columned texts), the font size is perfect. But I just can't past the absence of verse numbers. Difficult to use when planning lessons or taking notes, impossible for following along in church. Even though I hate using two Bibles but I will have to until Crossway gives us a Readers Bible WITH verse numbers."
4.0,Definitely runs large. It was very open and loose in the bust area especially. This is not a wrap dress but a pull over. It does have a functional drawstring waist. I am 5 foot 3 and weigh 160 pounds. There is definitely more color in the flowers then I thought.
4.0,I honestly loved this dress until the zipper broke after wearing it twice. Will probably look into fixing it because it's very comfortable and has pockets
4.0,"The shoe is very cute; however, they are slightly too wide and run a half size too big."
4.0,"I love this dress, it fits well and is good quality for the price. Getting a few more!"
4.0,Love the design and quality of the hat.  My only issue is it was a tad big on me.  But it's a cute style that can work with various fashion styles.
4.0,Love the fit! The lens are quite dark but I love the frames
4.0,"Excellent fit, right size"
4.0,I liked it a lot. It was sturdy and tight. Only down side is that I wear suit slacks all day and it wears the pants because it is built so good.
4.0,"A good way to organize and show off a collection of nice sunglasses, well-made with a nice lining."
4.0,Fits my 33 month twins perfectly. They looked cute in it
4.0,it's a nice Frankenstein Leather bag but it has a strong smell that has yet to dissipate after 2 weeks.
4.0,Dress looks super cute itself but the bow on the back is a bit droopy. Going to try to super glue it to stay up and perky and we'll see how that goes.
4.0,it eh
4.0,"These are super soft and comfortable. I wear them to workout but would also wear them as athleisure if they weren't so long on me. I am a shorty so I roll them up! I am 4'10"" 177 lbs and an XXL fit as well as any other legging. They stay put through tough workouts. Absolutely no compression."
4.0,A sweet party bag addition.  Good for ages up  6.
4.0,"It's  a very nice jumpsuit, comfortable and stylish.<br />The material is pretty good quality, lightweight but not flimsy, perfect for the summer., wash and dry well.<br />Fits a little big so I would suggest if you are between  two size to buy the smallest<br />and<br />Very pleased of it"
4.0,It's great for lounging around! I thought it would be a more expensive material but it kinda felt a little bit cheap. It fit perfect though! Either way I'll be wearing it around the house and when it starts to get more warm out!
4.0,I love the color and the style.
4.0,One of the hour glasses wasn't nearly full enough
4.0,"My son loves it. There was just a weakness with a zipper once where it popped open. However, it‚Äôs still zippering."
4.0,One sock was a little longer than the other. And both weren‚Äôt as long as they were in the picture. They are thick material but they were also very tight.
4.0,"It's very cute, I thought it was a little bigger than expected, because i wanted it for a baby. However, for yourself it is worth it and it is very pretty. ALso it is ajustable in size, although it is a litte expensive, but nonetheless i was happy with this product"
4.0,"I bought this tie/hanky combination to wear with a new suit. The color match was perfect. The length was good, even for me (6'3&#34;), and I could tie a good knot without difficulty, sometimes seen in cheaper ties. Good buy"
4.0,"This is a nice sweater and the green is a great color for the fall/winter months. I personally don‚Äôt like how short it is, and had a feeling I‚Äôd struggle with this, so I sized up. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs still not long enough for me, so I will be gifting this sweater. It does seem to be pretty good quality, and it‚Äôs nice and cozy, so I know my less length-picky sister will love it!"
4.0,"I like the concept of these gloves and for what I want them for, they are fine.  I wear them when we go birding and I can easily slip my fingers out the mitten end to adjust my binoculars.  They could be a bit longer as there is a small gap between my coat sleeve and glove.  Could also be a bit thicker.  Fine if the temps are in the 30s or maybe 20s but not any lower than that"
4.0,"these are a great quality, but they were just too bulky for me"
4.0,Nice for a young girl
4.0,I love how stretchy they are. They fit perfectly!
4.0,"Beautifully made. If worried about the clasp coming off, put some tape around it to keep it securely on"
4.0,"Size seems to run on smaller size but quality was good. I returned them instead of exchanging them, only because I received them on Sunday and my daughter needed shoes for Monday."
4.0,They fit well and very nice material.
4.0,Dress is stretchy enough and has a nice pattern.
4.0,It is a little bit light and cheap feeling.
4.0,Fun jewelry
4.0,"Fit was a little small, but that is normal.  the surface or texture was a little rough so my daughter wanted to return it.<br />Great experience overall."
4.0,Buenos para el frio
4.0,Material could be a little softer. Cotton was a little scratchy after the first wash.
4.0,"Good quality.  Wish it would cover the corners just a bit more, in case I dropped my Note 9. Looks classy"
4.0,"they were as described and sturdy, love them with the glare blocking ."
4.0,Warm jacket only thing with mine is the hood part where holds together the Velcro is the same on both sides so dont work
4.0,Appears to be good quality and is nice and warm
4.0,"Bill is too sharply curved, makes for a stiff look.  Otherwise, a fine fit and mint condition cap."
4.0,"Like material. Gave for stars because the fit is snug,  I ordered xlrg because I have large hands. I decided to keep them  Arrived on time"
4.0,I really like this belt. It keeps my pants up
4.0,Cute leggings but man these things run so small. I swear this size large is really a small. Gave them to my niece who is a size 1 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0,The purse is nice but I tought it would be a little bigger...
4.0,This is a very pretty set but its heavier round my neck that is the only reason I am returning it. I have to do little explaining to the customer service to get a lablel wow I thought this was one of there rules.
4.0,Looks and feels very comfortable
4.0,"Beautiful in person, nice quality"
4.0,"I like the look on the fitbit device.  I found it a little difficult to adjust the size, but the second band was much easier to adjust."
4.0,Loved the fabric...it felt great...
4.0,This dress is beautiful and I‚Äôm enjoying it. The material is very sheer but the underlining is good.
4.0,Would love to see these with an option for faster shipping as they were a hit! Would also love to see bulk price options
4.0,"It was a good purchase. The tankini top comes off for getting a little extra sun, or leave it on to cover up the mid section. Wasn't sure about the three pieces, but it did come in handy sometimes. Well worth it."
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress, doesn't feel like it's made out of cheap material. It's very long  tough. I don't like the packaging, it was so wrinky. The safest way to handle it is to bring it to a dry cleaner."
4.0,Beautiful!!!  Great piece!!  You should get this necklace.
4.0,"If you're looking an inexpensive, every day watch this is a great buy. Easy set up and function, looks nice."
4.0,I like them but they slip off with a slight tug.
4.0,"Overall, the gloves are super warm, the fleece lining is heavenly, and they work great for living in the cold harsh winters of Michigan.  I do have super tiny hands, and the smallest size still leaves me with a little bit of room in the fingers.  I bought them specifically for the touch screen feature without all the pesky lines that most gloves have.<br />They do work on touch screens but it is slightly difficult to do any gestures, and I feel like I have to press a lot harder on my phone to get it to work.  It might be because of the small hands thing, or it might just be the gloves.  I no longer have blue tooth controls in my car, so I have to use my phone to change songs when driving.  So the fact that its difficult is the one down side.  Other than that, they definitely keep me warm!"
4.0,I love how I don‚Äôt have to worry about hitting my arm and it popping off. Can be adjusted.
4.0,"They fit amazing on the legs!! But the waist isn‚Äôt very tapered in so it‚Äôs pretty big around my waist, and I‚Äôm not sure if a XS would fit my legs. I would like to try an XS maybe."
4.0,I wish the buckle part did a better job of holding tight.  Maybe it will with some additional wear like my older one.  I have one from close to twenty years ago as well as this one so it has potential to past a long time.
4.0,It fits a little small. But very comfy.
4.0,"This tank is true to color. I got a size small and it fits as a regular small tank would fit. By the design, it‚Äôs not intended to be flowy. It‚Äôs long enough to tuck into jeans, though not long enough & too fitted to be worn with leggings. It is fitted but not tight. I find the material is actually thicker than average burnout tops. For reference I am 5‚Äô3, 120lbs, 34DD. I typically wear a size sm top and size 3 jeans."
4.0,"A bit cheap looking, but it was perfect for the woman's march! Now, I wear it to bed!"
4.0,Shoes are well made and fit perfectly!
4.0,I only bought another one do you lose of weight
4.0,thanks...<br />My daughter likes them very much..^*^.<br />have a nice day.~~
4.0,"These compression socks are comfortable and appear to be well made.<br />The claim that they are easy-on/easy-off is a bit overstated, in fact I find them harder to take off than other compression socks I've worn."
4.0,But the back-lighting feature is much weaker than in any of its predecessors ‚Äì and I've owned them all.
4.0,"The XXL shirt is too long to wear untucked. .  I am 5 10&#34;, and it is knee-length. The shirt seems well made, but the &#34;Furies&#34;  patch is thick and wrinkled.  The only reviews were out of date, and said that the &#34;Furies&#34; name was silk screened, not a patch.  Due to the movie franchise fee, it is overpriced."
4.0,I live in the North and commute to work. This hat is lined and very stylish. I don't even feel the cold wind. I will be buying more colors.
4.0,"Hard to twist together with my nails, but a great necklace."
4.0,non
4.0,going to wear it to the capital ball on the cruise next month the dress is pretty a little itchy due to the sequel
4.0,I enjoyed the product fit perfect very  comfortable
4.0,"Brought the medium, and it was a little large, which was surprising.  The colors are lovely.  I paired it with a red belt and shoes.  Beautiful!"
4.0,"Fit as expected, color as pictured. I like it"
4.0,Belt is great but the chain broke on the second day of use
4.0,"I love it, It is a lot smaller then I expected I purchase an 4 XL, because I wanted it to really big but it fits like a US XL."
4.0,gift for a friend. He likes them.
4.0,"I‚Äôve never bought a shirt quite like this one. It‚Äôs very pretty and unique, and fits well even though it‚Äôs a bit tight. I got a size small and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 175. It has a zipper along the side underneath the left arm, however it doesn‚Äôt go all the way to the end of the shirt. It is a bit tight around my rib cage just under my bra, but the material does have a little give to it so it wasn‚Äôt too hard to zip up. The material is thicker and feels nice on the skin and is made well. I would‚Äôve like it to be a bit longer on my torso, but even with the few things that gave me a slight pause, I still love it and would buy it again!"
4.0,"ya get what ya pay for and this is exactly what I wanted.  quantity since I loose them easily.  happy with quality and price and speed of delivery.  I was surprised since they come from china, but delivery was fairly quick.  happy with purchase and I would buy these again."
4.0,"The arms were a little tight, and it's kind of itchy but not too bad I'll order more"
4.0,Small fit but okay .  Warm and can be worn underneath Beanies
4.0,A little bigger than I imagined but great gift
4.0,I use them when driving at night to cut down on glare.
4.0,"These are great socks, nice and warm. For some reason I just thought they would be softer. Love the colors though and they wash well."
4.0,"They are adequate for the price.  I miss the original nylon frames and excellent optics, these are probably fakes."
4.0,Cute but I wish I would have gotten a size bigger
4.0,Fits great and likes the material. Wore on a hot day and it was very comfortable.
4.0,"The sweater looks nice , well made, good attention to details (neck, cuffs and bottom).  As other reviewers indicated, the fabric is very soft on the skin.  I only gave it four stars because it is heavier than expected (at 50% viscose, and viscose is very heavy), and much warmer than I expected (the thread/knit is quite thick), not sure I can be comfortable in it during the summer."
4.0,I love this poncho.  I bought it to replace another one that I had and was pleasantly surprised that it was made even thicker than the one I had.  Which means it should be even more durable.  There's plenty of room inside if I wanted to pull my arms inside during heavy rains and the long length is great for protecting your whole body.  My only complaint is that the opening for the head is somewhat small.
4.0,Usually I have trouble with eye goggles not fitting my eyes and sealing around my eye sockets.  These 'uni'-goggle style are a great compromise for workout swimming.  I am looking forward to snorkeling with them soon.
4.0,"Beautiful and long enough to cover both front and back. The all poly is too hot for summer wear, so will save it for Fall."
4.0,"I really like them, my only complain is when I wear them just above my eyes and rest them on my ears, the ends really pinch in above my ears and I have to adjust them."
4.0,Fit well and was cute for my where‚Äôs Waldo costume. Stripes aren‚Äôt normally flattering but the alone cut made it look nice. Might where for Christmas
4.0,"Overall I liked the bathing suit. I wish the torso was a little taller because I found it to be not as full coverage up top as I would like. Overall, cute bathing suite."
4.0,Product was good quality.
4.0,"This Cap was purchased for my youngest son, who enjoys collecting all kinds of cap, and he appreciated receiving this cap, and I was glad it met his approval. The cap has a rich navy blue color that I personally like, because many times when purchasing navy blue, it tends to have a greenish tint."
4.0,Beautiful but not as shiny as expected üëç
4.0,Stone damaged
4.0,"These hoops are a bit smaller than I like and pretty delicate. However, they are elegant enough to wear with a multiple piercing style that doesn't look overwhelming. I LOVE Wostu! Fast shipping, velvet storage bag is awesome!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b3f47b510c80a2278209a17a7388e609]] These elephant pieces are GORGEOUS! üòç Looks very high quality and very detailed.  I love these.  I used my hand as a reference for size
4.0,It was a good present for my friend bday but it didn‚Äôt fit. I didn‚Äôt know the sizing was base on Asia size charts. Turns out it was 2 size smaller for him. Try to return it for refund but seller recommended i shouldn‚Äôt because returning it would cost me as much as buying it. So they had me keep the hoodie and refunded me a portion of my money. Overall very quick and wonderful customer service.
4.0,Overall not bad. They are a little on cheap side and as a result the edges are a bit rough.
4.0,Decent shaded lenses for the price. They are a lot thinner than regular ones but they fit the frame.
4.0,"I really liked the shorts, and they fit as expected around my waist, but they were a bit shorter than I was expecting. I think I'll replace this pair with Hurley's 21&#34; shorts instead."
4.0,I liked the pants. They were a little less baggy than I thought they would be but I will still wear them!
4.0,"I recently got into square neck tank tops been trying different brands.<br /><br /> These fit a little snug but will stretch out. Quality of cotton in a bit less smooth than other brands but the take away is the material feels a littler thicker . Shape fits right for me size medium 5'10 "" 175 lbs.<br /><br />Made in CHINA.<br /><br />I am purchasing more.<br /><br />Don't put these or any cotton underwear in the dryer. They will last much longer."
4.0,Love the socks just a bit small.
4.0,"These sunglasses fit great! However, I just wished they were a little bigger and showed a better fade transition."
4.0,Just as beautiful in person. I haven't worn it yet.
4.0,"I was surprised at how nice this dress is for the cost. Very pretty, fit perfect, a bit snug at chest, but still happy with it"
4.0,"Sooo cute!  I love these reverse naval rings, very stylish. Mine was a little bent when I got it in the mail, but considering how cheap it was I just bent it back into place and put it right in because I was so excited!"
4.0,make sure you read the specifics on the type of material.
4.0,Felt like it was made from an old bathing suit.  But the craftsmanship is good and its pretty.
4.0,Great fit very comfortable doesn't lose its shape. Going to order more.
4.0,I use this on all my pinstriping and sign brushes to keep them in good condition. the oil comes off easy and preserves my brushes very well.
4.0,Agree with other reviews that the case is ridiculous
4.0,Needs to be ironed and can't be put in dryer or dry cleaned.  May not have purchased if realized that it was not made of wrinkle free material.
4.0,"Good quality, looked like the picture. Will be using soon, so cannot comment on the quality yet."
4.0,The dress is stunning.  Some adjustments to the waist and the length and it was perfect.  The material is of good quality.
4.0,"Easy transaction, very please with product."
4.0,"Fits great, just a little tight in the bust area"
4.0,Good value but could be a bit larger
4.0,"Only disappointment was the slippers came in a remastered box, not the one showcased on TV-made me wonder if they were &#34;real&#34; Stompees or knockoffs.Product itself was fine."
4.0,I ordered this for my son who says it was just what he needed until his prescription glasses came in.
4.0,"Set of Baseball hats, very good quality and sturdy, very colorfull.<br /> They are made up of a thick fabric l which makes them durable.<br />These caps have an adjustable velcro strap that makes it easier to wear them on the head. They do run a little small. Like they are not ‚Äúdeep‚Äù enough. But we have them in the cars in case they are needed or if the kids forget the other ones.<br />Easy to wash. They hold up good.<br />Good very basic pack of hats!"
4.0,"Very nice, was a bit bigger than I expected"
4.0,I like these! They‚Äôre comfortable - the eyelets do fall off but other than that 10/10
4.0,"For reference I am 5'6"".  The blouse fits great in the shoulders, bust, and waist.  However the sleeves are very short, reaching about four inches above my wrist bones.  It is fairly short as well, not reaching my hip bones, but as it is worn tucked in, that's fine.<br /><br />I usually find shirt sleeves a bit too long so it is a very weird problem for me too have<br /><br />I received a lot of compliments on the blouse! It is pretty and priced well."
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute outfit. Not the best quality but good for the price!
4.0,Cute dress! The fit is almost perfect. Material is not the best but for the price def can be a great cheap party dress.
4.0,"I like this ring, but SAMCRO doesn't show up as well as the picture lets on, so l was a little disappointed. Also, the box it came in looks nice, but when I opened it, it was thin cardboard holding the ring instead if something soft and more protective."
4.0,This bag is cute but not too durable for the strap popped too quick.  Now I need another bag.
4.0,"I ordered this for my 1-year-old who won‚Äôt keep hats on his head. But it‚Äôs huge! It fits my 3-year-old and can even fit me. That said, it‚Äôs super soft and my 3-year-old loves it. And it‚Äôs adorable."
4.0,"My son let me know he was a furry awhile back and wanted something he could wear to Pride. I got this set as an affordable, quick option while he saves up for something a little higher quality. He loves them. The only complaint is the weird ties on it, but overall good."
4.0,I deducted a star because I had more than a few that arrived dead.  Specifically 6 of my 8 green lights were dead but for the price I really can't complain to much.  Bought these as stocking stuffers for the kids in my family and still had plenty of working ones to give out to friends for their kids.
4.0,They look exactly like the picture. Very cute. I love them.. If you have a broad neck you probably shouldn't order unless you have extenders.
4.0,Don't care for the texture of the number.
4.0,"The product arrived in perfect condition.<br />It looks like the pictures shown.<br />I‚Äôm a UK 10 in all my tops and a Small fit me.<br />The fabric does get stained easily so should anything get on it, wash it out immediately or be prepared to have it as part of the out outfit if you choose to wash it later."
4.0,Really short. It's a sweater not a dress.
4.0,They are very comfortable and fit as expected. The lace looks great but it tears very quickly.
4.0,"Like many croc style shoes, they can be hard to fit, especially for a narrow foot.  These work, but are effeminately loose on my size 4 narrow footed child.  She will probably be able to wear them for 2 years."
4.0,These are beautiful and I‚Äôd give five stars but I think my swordfish costas must be one version older than these - I had to use a dremel to finesse the edges before I could get them to fit. I don‚Äôt blame Fuse but still seems like I shouldn‚Äôt give it 5 stars?
4.0,"I haven,t worn them yet---tried them on feels comfortable"
4.0,love the softness of the dress fit well and was not see through
4.0,Very nice.  Easy to iron and fits fine.
4.0,"My dad has always been a fisherman, so this was a perfect gift!  It came in a nice cushioned box and the hooks had a protective cover over them.  I only gave it a 4, because I wish it were bigger and had some sort of cord or chain to hang it on something, as I'm sure he is not going to use it as a real lure even though he probably could!"
4.0,"The pink in the shoes did not match the same pink shade in the outfit.  Otherwise, I loved it."
4.0,"It fits well, I just didn't like the bust area. I got the floral and tan version, and thought the tan bust material would be silkier, but it's kind of an unflattering texture and goes up really high so it seems like the bust was meant for someone much larger. Other than that, I still like it."
4.0,Cute and received quickly. comes in a nice velvet bag.  Worth the money.
4.0,Very elegant but you need to order a bigger size
4.0,Really cute - I'm ready for October! It fit really well and was easily adjustable. The collar itself is more sheer than I expected but still cute.
4.0,"Love this top, very cute, 131lbs ordered a medium, a little big, not noticeable, other than that no complains!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,"These earrings are exactly as described: smooth, long, simple, ...  I think they are quite nice. A nice dark green jade."
4.0,"The Only reason im giving 4 stars, is because the dress its self was VERY see through. Thank god i was on Vacation and it really didnt matter. However if you want to go with No bra.. Good luck! But overall iot ws cute.. used it for a All white photo shoot with my friends. I bought a large, 179, 5'6."
4.0,Lil small...but still  cute!!!!
4.0,I usually size up in all my clothes because of my chest but it looks like this would‚Äôve ran big so I just ordered a large in stead of XL. I was right. The large is slightly a little bit too big but I don‚Äôt mind that. I have all my clothes baggy. I have a cardigan another shirt from this brand that also run big so I think it‚Äôs just the brand that runs big.<br />The dress itself is nice and the material isn‚Äôt itchy. It‚Äôs a nice material.<br />It‚Äôs a very twirly dress.<br />I love it isn‚Äôt short at all. It‚Äôs little bit up my knees. And it doesn‚Äôt really show that much cleavage for me so that‚Äôs a win.<br />I will be ordering mediums from this brand for now on if I ever order more clothes. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äù7 145ish lb size 38 dd in chest.<br />Hope this helps.
4.0,"I was disappointed with my purchase of the red stone necklace but see that they have put more clear photographs with that product.  However, I really like this product.  It is colorful yet understated.  I can wear it as a torsade or as a cascade of color.  The grey has a hint of purple when next to the soft blue, orange, and tan.  The catch does not have an extension and the leather/wood design may result in a shorter time for use but I will enjoy this product."
4.0,"Model looks great in it. Me not so much,  but I like it.  Cannot wear as dress,  side slits come up to hips,  more boat neck then off shoulder,  soft material,  not cotton,  very loose fitting.  But for bathing suit it will be great AND..I plan on using it as tunic.  I take large safety pin and on underside of front will gather material to make folds and use pin to hold folds in places.  Viola hourglass figure."
4.0,"love the dress, it is just a bit larger than what I wanted. Order a size down"
4.0,This outfit is adorable. However the 'new' onesie was actually blue writing instead of black like I thought. Not the end of the world but it doesnt necessarily match the outfit now. The hat is cute as well. Arrived quickly.
4.0,Love the product but when I receive the glasses they did have a scratch on them. I was just too lazy to return. I've gotten lots of compliments on them definitely a good buy!
4.0,I love the print but the dress was too big. It did not ‚Äúhug‚Äù correctly around the bust where the skirt pleats. May try a smaller size but I needed it for an event this weekend.
4.0,"The outfit is cute, but you can see throught the top and bottoms"
4.0,"Love this top great with jeans, pants or shorts"
4.0,"I was surprised at the feel of the material, but there wasn't a detailed description, so I took a chance. There is no stretch to it, and it is a thin like blouse material. I have a 41&#34; bust and ordered the XL, and it fit well. It wasn't too tight at the top and it had some movement at the bottom, but I would have liked it more had it been cotton and had stretch. I am going to return though, because I feel like I will just get annoyed at the fact that there is no stretch."
4.0,"Just a basic digital watch -- time, date, stop-watch, basic light-function (no indiglo). The time displays the seconds and the band is comfortable. I just wish it had a timer as it would have been useful for my workouts, but all-in-all, very decent."
4.0,It fit just as expected. And it also washed well!
4.0,"Bracelet was nice enough, just not what I was looking for. Solid, but with enough give to slide over my wrist. It was true to the image and description."
4.0,Very nice purse for the money.  Very practical and smart looking without a lot of glitz!  Room for all my junk but not a bulky purse.  The only negative thing is the shoulder strap - it's a little too light weight and gets twisted easily.  Other than that I love this purse.
4.0,Cute and sassy just the way I like it!
4.0,Fine piece of jewelry. Look really cheek especially with the matching earrings.
4.0,"Purchased this bag for showers at the gym, and it's a good size for that and will hang on a hook or curtain rod to keep toiletries within reach.  Two side pockets provide extra storage space.  Clean looking and efficient, we'll see if it endures."
4.0,A nice simple howlite necklace that matches other howlite jewelry nicely.
4.0,fits smaller than expected. My kid is in 6 month clothes and this just fits her comfortably.  Overall super cute though.
4.0,"Four stars only because, if you look at my photos, I'm a touch worried about durability. Those photos are after two days of use and I'm seeing a bit more wear than I'd like where the band is laminated together at the holes.<br /><br />That said, this is a very nice band. I LOVE the two metal loops stitched into the clasp side of the band, that is just great in daily functionality and something I'll be looking for in future bands (or to buy more from this manufacturer).<br /><br />I have a small wrist for a guy, and this leaves a lot of holes for even smaller wrists. If you have a large wrist, I'd suggest this will be a problem for you because I barely go through the two metal loops (as I said - I love those but partially because they're perfectly placed for my small wrist).<br /><br />Also, the 22mm wide band I ordered, is 22mm wide for the entire band - another unique aspect of this band. While I like that - I've gotten used to at least a slight taper in most bands, so it looks just a little wide overall, but not something I think is bad, just something to take note of as you shop around.<br /><br />Color seems to be solid through the strap and does not look like it'll fade on me. I do sweat a lot in the wrist and noticed a small amount of ""blue"" on my wrist the first day, but not the second.<br /><br />This is a very attractive band with rich coloring and very nice stitching!"
4.0,Nice quality hat little disappointed
4.0,"Although  the dress was not white and navy as pictured, it is a beautiful dress. I ordered according to size chart but it was sort of small and tight on me. Wished I ordered 1 size up but I would be risking it being too big."
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 135lbs with 32f boobs. Usually wear medium/size 8 but I ordered an XL to be safe and it fit a little loose. A Large would've been ideal. Besides that, the suit is perfection. Offered support in the boob area which is what I was hoping for.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!<br /><br />So I ordered a large and it's PERFECT! Love this suit. I'll get the green one adjusted so I can wear them both!"
4.0,"It just not heavy enough for me, but great jacket"
4.0,"A la vista se ve que es duradero y de calidad, pero los ganchos se ven de una calidad media"
4.0,decent quality for the price
4.0,Sleeves are finished with a wide band of fabric and the fabric is natural to the touch
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, vividly colored, and adorable. Would definitely order again."
4.0,She was just starting college and wondering if she was going to be able to handle it.  I sent this to her and she called feeling SO happy and encouraged.  she loves it.
4.0,A nice low price watch. Very easy to set up. Do not like the buckle wristband Would prefer expandable wristband
4.0,There was no belt with it. The dress looks lovely though
4.0,"I like it, will probably buy again.  I use it for owb cc."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a cute swim suit. However, you must MUST get a larger size. I don‚Äôt know how much larger I would‚Äôve had to go...I got a large and I usually wear medium. These run super small!"
4.0,"I wore this too yesterDay. It‚Äôs long enough I could just wear it as a dress, but it‚Äôs November in new England. I love the top except for the lace up string it came with. I couldn‚Äôt get them through the loops on the shirt. Seemed like a lot of work so I used them as cat toys instead."
4.0,Nice ring for an economy purchase.
4.0,Wonderful tight fit and it is nice to have a skirt with a higher waist. I also like the length of the skirt. It is obviously imitation leather but at this price one would expect that. Good value when one wants a nice form fitting pencil skirt.
4.0,"Cute dress but a bit too small.  I gave the dress to my small granddaughter and bought the medium for myself.  I am 5' and weigh 112#.  The dress is comfortable and very good quality for the price.  The cotton skirt wrinkles easily, but it does not show on the print skirt."
4.0,love the delicate lines.  color is hard to see in the stones.
4.0,"This would have been a 5 star rating but my ears are a little funky and don't quite stand up well. Other than that -- people mistake this for an actual &#34;Spirit Hood&#34; all the time. The quality of the faux fur, other materials and the construction (other than one ear) is very good. It is also toasty warm -- in fact every time I wear it I end up taking it off because I get too hot."
4.0,The watch bands fit great and seem to be of good quality. the screen protectors however trap water under them when you wash your hands or do anything with wate.
4.0,"Very comfy!  The material was a little thinner than I expected, but at my age that could be a good thing!"
4.0,great for a costume
4.0,Material great but took a long time to come
4.0,I got the 0-6 month size for my 5 month old and they are HUGE. They seem more like 6-12 month. But at least they will fit all summer. They are really adorable for the price though.
4.0,These are cute accessories for a baby girl's outfit. After a few wears and after washing the braid detail looks funny and needs adjusting.
4.0,"They are very pretty, but just kind of tight across the toes."
4.0,used it as a bag charm
4.0,"Great selection of plugs, very impressed with the set as a whole. There are some stones that have more interesting veins and colors, but that is the nature of the beast. A smidge smaller in diameter than the last brand of stone plugs I ordered, not by a whole size, just noticed when I had them next to each other."
4.0,works well. Good quality.
4.0,"I like them but they are really really warm,  so if you're feet run hot or if you aren't looking for warmth these are not the slippers for you.  But perfect for cold Minnesota winters!"
4.0,Love üíï it
4.0,"This dress was super cute, and the A-line is perfect for those of us who have &#34;a little extra&#34;."
4.0,a little snug for a healthy 6yr old
4.0,It does run small. I ordered an XL and I'm normally a medium. Light weight which is perfect for summer and the color blue is serene. Buttons are a little loose.
4.0,Tshirt material.  I usually wear a lg or xl. Got the xl. Fits good. Hides the lil belly. Could be tighter on the hip for the slouch look. Wearing it to bartend right now.
4.0,"A little to small.  If you purchase, be sure to measure your calf first to get correct size."
4.0,"I purchased four hats to compare because I could not decide ‚Äì Lanzom Wide Brim Straw, Pineapple&Star Sun Straw Fedora, Catrin Faldon Palm Straw Panama, and Meximart Mexican Palm Leaf Straw Indiana. The Lanzom and P&S are both soft paper panama hats. The Catrin and Meximart are rigid palm leaf hats.<br />The Lanzom was the ‚Äúfloppiest‚Äù of them all. The brim was not rigid enough for me and had ‚Äúwaves‚Äù in it. It also sat very high on the head due to a deep crown. I didn‚Äôt care for the way it felt; like it was too small even though it wasn‚Äôt. It was the least formal-looking of all the hats because of the lack of form to it. The plus is that this is the only one that might survive in a suitcase. There have been reviews about it being crushed on arrival. Mine was not. It was packed in a box and arrived in good shape. It could‚Äôve been that I ordered other items, so it was packed in a box instead of an envelope. That may be the key to ensuring that the hat comes unsquashed.<br />The Pineapple&Star was the best packaged of all the hats with a cardboard frame for the brim. It looks more formal than the Lanzom because the brim is sturdier and flat without any waves. It‚Äôs not floppy at all. It also has a deep crown so it sits high on the head like the Lanzom. Other than that, the only problem with the P&S is that it‚Äôs very round. It did not fit well, with big gaps on each side of my oval head. It did come with foam spacers, but all the other hats fit much better without any modifications.<br />The Catrin fit very well and is a very nice hat. The only issue I had with it is a personal preference. I did not like the brim turned up in the back. If you like that, this would be a good choice. It‚Äôs heavier and much more rigid than the two paper straw hats, but it‚Äôs not uncomfortable. The upside is that it won‚Äôt have any problems in heavy rain.<br />My personal favorite was the Meximart. It‚Äôs comfortable, fits very well, and has a wider brim than the others. That‚Äôs also the downside, however, if you‚Äôre looking for a more formal appearance. The brim is much wider than the others and will keep the sun off better than the others, but it looks more like a beach or yard hat, not formal enough for what I was looking for. I liked the style of it better than the others, though. This would be my choice for a sun hat in more casual situations."
4.0,Led to believe it had snap closure which would have been nicer for my needs but kept because of comfort and style
4.0,"Good quality, slim style and slits for cards. Great find."
4.0,"it is cheap, but made perfect for the couple bucks I paid for I. It's only gonna fit a Chinese guy or a small child, it fits my 11 year old nicely."
4.0,The material is super thin!
4.0,Pretty and nicely made but to small for a plus size women donated them.
4.0,"Most reviews said they run small, so I went up a size from my normal size....big mistake. They actually run larger and now I have LOTS of extra room in the front belly section.  I like the looseness of the legs (mine are thick and always a concern when buying off the internet), but I don't like how much extra material and height are in the waist and hip area.  They sit very high on my stomach and I have to fold them down.  I am just going to use them as pajama pants instead of a nice lounge pant.  The design is nice and fabric is light, I live in West Texas and heat is always a problem.  They are airy and comfortable....next time I will order the 'right size'."
4.0,"Pretty good fit.  Read reviews about fit, and bought a size larger than I usually wear."
4.0,I loved that my iPhone 6 Plus can fit inside and I love the color! Sadly it arrived with what looked like several pen markings on it and they won't wash off. The company was wonderful and sent me a free replacement!
4.0,They are good quality and a great deal for this price. My daughter loves these!
4.0,I love this shirt. Mine had a flaw in the fabric which was repaired with stitching that didn‚Äôt match the white fabric. But the fit and quality was spot on.
4.0,"I got this cap for my wife to keep her head warm on cool winter nights. She said that she likes it, but with her short hair style it's a bit too large for her."
4.0,The only thing that would make this better is ties instead of bte loops.
4.0,"Cute and very good product for the price. Order a size up, which is usual for bathing suits."
4.0,"Tired of giving out the same party favor bags with the same junk that no one wants? We were too until we got these!<br /><br />These finger lights were a big hit as party favors for our 4 yo birthday party. Every single kid ripped open the package and immediately had fun with them. We also had numerous adults ask if we had extra for their other kids or for themselves. We even had a, ahem, family member ""take"" one when we said we wanted to make sure all the kids got them first.<br /><br />-FUN FACTOR-<br />I remember having fun with a laser pen when they were the craze 20 years ago. Four different colored lights that strap to fingers? You could keep me, I mean, a kid busy for hours!<br /><br />-DURABILITY-<br />Well, the bands break somewhat easily on some of these. After heavy use for an 30-60 minutes, some of the stitching will fall apart. You can still use the lights but they will no longer stay on your fingers. The lights, on the other hand, stay lit for many hours. Haven't even seen one run out of batteries yet.<br /><br />-SAFETY-<br />Maybe I'm wrong and stupid but I have no concern with kids aiming these at their eyes. If you are afraid of light beams shooting into eyeballs, I suggest you find another toy since kids will undoubtedly point these things at their own eyes, the kids' eyes near them, your dog's eyes, and even &lt;gasp> your eyes. Personally, I wouldn't give these to any kid under 3 since I'd be afraid of them swallowing them (along with the dangerous battery).<br /><br />-VALUE-<br />You get 40 lights but keep in mind that you're really getting 10 packages with 4 lights in each. Still comes out to about 80 cents a package. Not sure what could be more entertaining for under $1."
4.0,Ring fits tighter than the size.  Great ring very pretty
4.0,Some of these are amazing! A few clasps broke but worth the purchase!
4.0,Liked that they worked but the sliding connectors not so happy with. They work for the most part but come apart now and again!
4.0,"Fits nicely. I'm 5'9"" 185 lbs small chest but curvy. Very comfortable.  Needed a faja but looked good. Snap on back very fragile, dont expect it to hold up but still a good deal all in all."
4.0,"I loved them ! I'm a D cup . they were easy to use and comfortable , except if you sweat (like I did at a summer country music festival) they begin to slip off ):<br />the nipple pasties are the absolute best . also comfortablenlike you're not wearing anything , and they don't show through your shirt like other ones I've used !!!! I'll definitely buy these all over again when my current ones wear our .<br /><br />***the first picture is with the nipple pasties to show what it'd look like without a bra . the second picture is with the bra , third picture is with the bra ."
4.0,"These are close fitting on my rather large head, and warm,  I am not sure they are the most comfortable I've found as they are quite snug, enough so that I'm wondering if my commute is going to leave me with a headache.  They also are hair squashers.  They are quite lightweight and warm."
4.0,"One of the prettiest things I've ever bought. But runs small, so a little tight. Been losing weight, so may fit better soon. If larger size were available, would buy a couple more, it's that pretty and soft."
4.0,I needed this for a chucks and tux fundraising event. It looked great with the chuck taylors. This dress was great! It showed my curves at the top but had enough wiggle room at the waist/hips without looking old fashioned. I would wear it out again!
4.0,Almost impossible to get the liquid in the whole tube is small but I'm using them as samples so it didn't matter as much but they are hard to work with.
4.0,Very nice bag well made manly style.  Unfortunately the side and top compartment does not fit an iPhone 6s Plus and I would like a Velcro cushioning for a camera.  But it is very functional good for a water bottle but just ok to hold a spill proof mug.
4.0,"I bought this top to go with a pair of black and white stripped cropped wide legs pants and returned it because you could see the strips of the pants through the top.  It is very soft and feels really good on.  It is true to size and seems to be very good quality.  It came packaged really nicely with tissue paper and in a ziplock bag.  It is part cashmere and is good quality.  If you don't mind able to see your bottoms through the top, I would buy it."
4.0,"I have had these underwear for several months now, and wear them almost exclusively. These underwear are soft, comfortable, and do not ride up in my experience. I love the colors, which were absolutely true to the product pictures.<br /><br />However, I feel that the longevity of these underwear compared to typical cotton underwear (e.g. Jockey cotton underwear) is lacking. These underwear do not pill, but the edges/seams of the underwear by the leg holes show broken elastic threads. I use the washer and dryer on the lowest heat settings, but maybe this could be prevented by not using the dryer at all.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase due to the comfort level of these underwear. I just wish that they were more robust to wash/dry cycles."
4.0,"Adorable shoe! The listing said they run small so I bought a size bigger than usual, but they're still too small"
4.0,Not as loose as I expected
4.0,"Cute tank, not moisture wicking, but I still wear to hot yoga."
4.0,"Simple tool that does the job more than satisfactory. Recommended highly. Met expectations, and more. Sometimes retro things are better."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 180 lbs. large fits well, perhaps a little roomier than needed. Very very cute. Only issue is the top fabric is a little thin so my bra<br />Shows through."
4.0,"Doesn't look as depicted, however it is a nice looking item I wear when dressing up."
4.0,"Great price/service. Easy to wear, comfortable f doing things around the house/yard while keeping ur hands dry and scrape free"
4.0,Nice quality. A little heavy to wear. Still cute.
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter who is a CNA and needed some ankle support and was unhappy with calf-length compression socks because they were too hot. So far, so good. We washed them up right away and she‚Äôs been wearing them for 10-12 hour shifts and feels her ankles are better off than they were with regular socks. She likes the colors and the fit is good. We ordered the S/M for her as she wears anywhere from an 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 depending on brand of shoe. The L/XL would have been too big. I should add she has narrow, flat feet."
4.0,"These are really cute pajamas.  I love the pattern and design.  Unfortunately the shirt was made with really tight arms and did not fit, nor did the mask.  The pants did fit, however, and my daughter loved them so much that we kept the set.  The pants are cute on their own with a t-shirt, but I wish she could have worn the whole set together.  The pants are made of very stretchy forgiving material, while the shirt's material, although incredibly soft, was not very stretchy."
4.0,"I love this bathing suit! I got the large because I have wide hips/big butt and the bottoms fit perfect! I'm a  36 B also, and the large top fit me perfectly too! I'm kind of nervous to wear it out though, because the bottoms are like a thong, but I'll suck it up and wear it out! Lol"
4.0,"This is a one piece, zippered back skeleton suit. Colors are vibrant and print is on both sides of the outfit. The size was smaller than I expected, but it worked out. Really expected it to be larger, daughter could not wear anything but leggings and bodysuit underneath."
4.0,I rate this 4.5 out of 5. It was a gift to a friend. She loves it and it came in a timely manner. It is the color that is displayed in the image.
4.0,"They fit fairly well and have a nice stretch to them. I just wish they would have been able to go up to my thighs without rolling back down to my knees, but I bought them expecting this to possibly happen; so I don't mind it lol. Nice product overall!"
4.0,Loved the set.  Exactly as described.
4.0,"Material isn't super soft and actually a bit scratchy and rough, though it does look exactly as pictured, and feels quite warm."
4.0,Freakin' awesome band! It was easy to install and now i can wear one of my favorite wristwatches again. The clasp is a bit hard to work with though
4.0,"It's litle huge, but is a beatifull blouse, i received a large one fits like a X-Large"
4.0,Thanks !!!!
4.0,Love this shirt‚Äîwish it were washable.  Dry clean only.
4.0,"Very nice. Light material that's perfect for cosplay or dance. Zipper is sturdy. Also has nice long sleeves that cover the entire arm, even on my long-armed daughter."
4.0,"Like the fabric, but it was too large. Also it wasn't skinny fit as advertised, very baggy around the hips."
4.0,The costume is exactly what it looks like. Did not wear the headpiece but took off the bow and it was much cuter. I also altered the neck straps to make it look more like Betty's neck straps. Overall happy with it.
4.0,These were a gift for my grandson. My daughter says that he likes them a lot. They are bright enough to see during the day too.
4.0,Adorable !  My daughter is 13 and wore this for Halloween and many times after.  Was a little big on her but that shows it is true to size ( she is more of a kids XL and I bought the adult Small).<br />Would have been 5 stars but the tail came off after washing it..
4.0,Cute dress but it was too small and too short. I could maybe pass it off as a shirt or pass it along to my daughter who is a size 12. I ordered a 3X. I typically wear dress size 20 or 22.
4.0,"Jewelry is very cute, but it‚Äôs not real so it did leave a mark for me."
4.0,The earring is beautiful but the one of the clip on was loose.
4.0,"Nice belt- beware- it's quite small in circumference- for my size 12, it fit rib cage for an empire waist dress (returned because it didn't work well w style of dress- competed w the plunging neckline)"
4.0,"Pretty solid glasses overall. The frames look great, the lenses are tinted really dark. The biggest problem is the hinges feel like they could break at some point. Not sure how long this will last.<br /><br />Roll update after a month of testing by my wife."
4.0,"I love it. I dont use the earrings but everything else is great. The only thing I dont like is that the kimono doesn't have the enclosed sleeves that others have. Other that that the fit is good, the fabric is smooth and not irritating."
4.0,It was a Christmas present...they loved it.
4.0,Arrived on time.....nice ....its great on my small wrist......lightweight......stone is beautiful...looks real !!!
4.0,Arrived a day early and it‚Äôs exactly as pictured ! I will order again from this company.
4.0,Bag is very pretty and stylish and cute! I use it regularly as a small bag to carry books and accessories. The zipper isn't that great especially for the small one however if used carefully and lightly it works. I love it!
4.0,It was a Birthday gift and she loved it.
4.0,"Very nice dress, light comfortable and pretty. The only thing it's very small. I've bought size XL for my mother who generally wears M/L and it still is too small. Unfortunately they don't sell XXL, I definitely would exchange for a bigger size. Otherwise it's a great dress."
4.0,"Cute dress, comfortable. Fabric feels nice. Print isn‚Äôt quite as vibrant as I was expecting"
4.0,"Although this is a heavy T-shirt fabric, it is surprisingly warm. The color is not as shown. Instead of a wine color, it is red. A darker red, but still red. I can live with that. Very comfortable."
4.0,The good:<br />1) bag material is good quality.<br />2) Fits perfectly under seat -even a little overstuffed.<br />3) handle seems sturdy and good height options<br />4) a hell of a lot cheaper than a B&S of the same size<br /><br />Minor design issues could be improved:<br />1) wheels are good on smooth surfaces but struggle on rough areas (ie don't feel sturdy midtown Manhattan).<br />2) side pocket is kinda useless except for a water bottle.  And then only zips from one side so bottle falls out (Contigo 16oz Autoseal)
4.0,I love the design and the color beige design is as seen in the picture!! The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the little nose of the rabbit came with a defect the good thing is that I was able to fix it.  Other than that is very cute!
4.0,It is a cute dress is smaller than expected.
4.0,"Luce bien, solo que de noche no se ven las manecillas"
4.0,"Being a Sega fan, I really like it. I just wish they made one of the US genesis model, but love it nonetheless."
4.0,I think they're worth it. Im wearing them for my wedding. They are bigger than I expected for the flower but not bad in my opinion. The Rhine stones for the flower petals are kinda dull and not too shiny but maybe I can polish it up a bit. Even if not they'll work just fine for what I need them for. Im a 5/8th
4.0,It's as good as any for a short time
4.0,"To play devils advocate to my claim. However the package system works, whether it was amazon or the seller itself, the package was faulty. Upon arrival, it was just a thin plastic sleeve along with two other hard items in a somewhat malleable recyclable thick paper parcel. Since it is acrylic, the packaging did not bode well. It arrived with small pieces chipped off the bigger petals, and the chain was loose on the first segment (only on one earring) so the whole bottom part fell off upon putting them on. I fixed it, and will be smoothing and disguising the chips. Overall, I'd say these are a solid purchase. It's just a lottery on if you get a bubble wrapped parcel or not. It's nice quality otherwise.<br /><br />But like one last thing. The ""real shoot"" claim is doubtful on the images. The images share the same sheen on the models as they do on the main image. I'm not saying it's bad. Just a weird thing to add if it's false to begin with."
4.0,"Arrived just as pictured and a very soft, fuzzy material.  My 9 year old daughter loves it but the 10-12 barely fits her and is above her ankles. Had we known it ran so small we would have ordered a size up."
4.0,Optics for driving - not too bad.
4.0,This is a very fitted dress and need to size up for a better fit
4.0,Perfect for my purpose -- nighttime moisturising of my arms!  Lightweight and good price.
4.0,"Loved it, but I wasn't expecting a little metal circle connecting the rhinestones to the belly ring. It's beautiful and perfect for short cut shirts. The length is great aswell."
4.0,"Just received and installed this strap. I needed it to replace broken one on my timex expedition watch. The tools provided worked great and was pretty much needed in my case, one of the reasons I went with this band. The band itself seems comfortable enough, very easy to install once you remove old band.<br />The constructions quality seems not bad. The band is actually flexible and not stiff as I had originally thought.<br />I purchased the 20mm length and it seems to be perfect, the clasp rests around the outside of my wrist and isn't intrusive when I place my wrist on a table.<br /><br />I literally just put it on so I will edit this review accordingly in a month or so on exfended comfort, durability and over all feel(if I remember to do so)."
4.0,"I love the fabric design of these slippers, a red tartan, green, white, black and gray tartan.  The lining is soft cushion and cozy.  The only problem is the size.  I ordered small and they are way too big for me.  They are slip on so it doesn't totally matter but the height of the toe box is also too large so they slip off.  If they fit, I think they would be perfect!  I also love that they can be worn outside as they have a nice solid waterproof sole!"
4.0,"Good watch that does everything I need out of a watch. It is a bit on the small side, even for a Casio. It‚Äôs probably the right size for a ladies watch. Good watch overall though."
4.0,Great price and looks very nice.  Roomy and dressy
4.0,I gave it four stars cause it fogged up in the shower. I love it though. Sturdy and rugged. Has a great illuminating light and hourly chime. Solar power means no replacing batteries. It charges while I wear it just fine. I recommend this item.
4.0,My wife loves the ring. But it.is either a bit small or she is now a larger finger size. Still fits.just a little snug.
4.0,This is such a cute top! The only complaint I have is it had quite a few strings hanging from it.
4.0,"Cute shirt, but a little thin and tight in the chest area, and really long in the back....but overall super cute!"
4.0,Wore this outfit to Miami Carnival 2017. I absolutely loved it.
4.0,"I ordered XL as per the chart recommendation.  It's mighty tight, which I guess is the whole idea.  Putting it on you have hook closures at the bottom--good thing or you'd never get the zipper to go up.  The hooks provide just enough closure to get the zipper connected.  Then you have to suck it up, and work the zipper to the top.  Again, tight for sure.  It's more or less a gut girdle, which presumably gives back support.  So far, I've never found one of these ""posture correctors"" or back supports very helpful, so I keep trying.  Time will tell....we'll see."
4.0,"Love this shirt, fits just about perfect but for one of the sleeves is a little off somehow. However, it's comfy and it's one of my favorite tops."
4.0,Not Bad  but  RUN SMALL  and  THIN  -  Tight Fit
4.0,This dress is form fitting and runs small. I would size up 1 or 2 if you want a more flowing fit. Material is soft and loved the webbing attachment to the sleeves. Very cute.
4.0,Fits as expected the fur looks real
4.0,"Great gloves, both for working & cool weather. Not too thick that they prevent finger movement. Great size for men without massive hands, teen boys, or women with larger hands. They have a bit of a stretch to them so they may fit bigger hands too. Nice hand grip & adjustable wrist straps. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the sport logo on one of the gloves arrived with a black smudge that I cannot get off."
4.0,Even after numerous washes the black bleeds . But over all I like them . I got a small little snug but doable
4.0,"I know this says mens but I bought it for me to use when we went to Disney.  I hate wearing hats (I really don't look good in them) but with the heat that I knew I was going to be experiencing, I was willing to get over that.  I wanted a running hat because I figured that the moisture wicking aspect would help me feel cooler in addition to the open mesh.  The hat was comfortable to wear and nice and airy.  It dried quickly after going on water rides and did not trap my sweat in, instead allowing it to evaporate as promised.  My husband will wear it for running now that we are back from the trip but the one thing I don't like about it is that the sweat band area is not an absorbent material so it does not stop sweat from running down your face (the hat minimizes the amount of sweat that you produce but it doesn't block what does form from falling).  That is one thing that is better about my husband's running hats from other brands.  Overall though this hat definitely served its purpose."
4.0,very soft and comfortable but the medium was way too big; gave them to my daughter in law.
4.0,Just a little bigger
4.0,I like it it good on my arm
4.0,As described.  Receiver was happy with shirt.
4.0,It's a good fit everywhere except the arm holes. Those were a little small which makes it uncomfortable.
4.0,They are a little heavy and didn't come Wilton a rubber backing.
4.0,The softness.
4.0,Very comfortable . I had to have back surgery that's y I got it . works out very well.
4.0,"Very pretty, well-made statement necklace.  Colors are as shown in picture but it is a lot more sparkly than in pic. Due to all the bling it doesn‚Äôt look very bohemian, but still pretty.  It‚Äôs too dressy for what I needed it for, unfortunately, which was to wear with my black bathing suit.  But would be great to dress up a black Tshirt and jeans or a little black dress. Needs earrings to match!"
4.0,"These are mostly comfortable shoes and look great, but sizes run a bit too small. I wear 8 1/2 and I would swear these are size 8."
4.0,it‚Äôs very comfortable and the material is nice. it can be used for both hot days and colder days. It‚Äôs not too long or too short. i love it!! although it came scrunched up but it‚Äôs  easy to straighten out.
4.0,I like The product because they are light.  I want to come home and take off my shoes and slip into something comfortable .  I think they show have in this model one for women a little narrower on the strap.
4.0,Very cute. This hats brim is very large so it's great if you want a lot of coverage in the sun. The only downfall to this hat is the way it is shipped. It comes folded in half twice so has a few creases to get out before you wear. I figured it wasn't too much of a problem as I had to fold it to pack it anyways. The creases didn't bother me and didn't make it look bad due to the way it fell once I had it on. I think maybe if you were to get it wet and let it dry flat it would help get them out.
4.0,venden lo que muestran
4.0,It bigger than I expected but it's very pretty.
4.0,These look nice but also wash up well & do not shrink when i accidentally had a couple go in the dryer. We use the insert pocket for filters they show you should get for added protection. I recommend. Price nice. Washes well. Looks good. 4 stars :)
4.0,I am 5.6 and weigh about 155 and I ordered the large.  I don‚Äôt feel I have a very long torso however this felt too short in the torso causing it to stretch and made me ‚Äúlose‚Äù my waist since it didn‚Äôt form to my curves.  It wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker so I put on a belt to cinch it in and looked much better.  Got lots of compliments.
4.0,I had to return my first ones to order a size bigger than my normal shoe size. Now they fit fine. A good buy for the money.
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress, and the fabric is good quality. However, it is far too big, I am between a 14 and 16 and ordered an XL which will have to be altered. Size down when ordering!"
4.0,"Sleeves run a bit short. My son is 6'3 and never had a problem with sleeve length with a large, this shirt was about an inch and a half too short."
4.0,Ask for medium it was way to small
4.0,Cute ID holders and can fit money and 5 cards highly recommend it
4.0,I am very pleased with this purchase. I can't wait to wear it.
4.0,This product is just okay.  It does not last long and I have to reapply it 24/48 hours later.  I‚Äôve follow the instructions but it still dogs in the nose area of my lens.  A small and a expensive item to constantly have to replace so often.
4.0,I love this top but Amazon told me ‚ÄúXL will fit you best‚Äù and I should have gotten a large at most? I‚Äôm a small person with big boobs so it‚Äôs hard to gauge sizes online. I wasn‚Äôt able to return for a smaller size so I actually just cut the sides of the top and sewed it in slimmer. The quality of the fabric and the lace is amazing I didn‚Äôt have any type of tearing or running when I altered anything and it was worth the effort.
4.0,"Bought it for my mom, and she loves it. Perfect size"
4.0,"The torso portion was too small for me, which made the underoos portion too tight and just unpleasant. Super cute otherwise. I'd just want the torso portion longer, not necessarily a larger size"
4.0,Best bet for the collecto
4.0,"These earrings are heavy, so be prepared if you plan on wearing them to work."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but nice."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt know what I was going to get when I ordered due to the confusing listing. The colors in the drop down said tan but pictured the black bra and the black writing had a photo of the tan bra. It was a gamble because I didn‚Äôt know if I was getting the photo or the written color. I ended up getting the black one shipped to me. Shipping did take almost a month. The sizing in the drop down selection range from xsmall to large but the description said cup size A-D. It looks like the color part has been updated and fixed. The photo makes it look like there is an area that is not sticky. It came with a round white patch that can be moved where it is needed. It is adjustable like the photo but the fit is different than normal cup shaped bras. The adhesive is better than other strapless bras I have used in the past because the entire back of the bra is adhesive. I only use these types of bras on a rare occasion when I wear a backless dress so I didn‚Äôt have it on for more than a few hours. I don‚Äôt know how well it would hold up for longer periods of time or how it would hold for dancing/moving around and sweating. I used this with a dress that had some shape to it so I didn‚Äôt notice it moving. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,The only thing I don't care about these is the plastic piece you use to velcro them. It can turn on it's side. Besides that I love these. Do expect water to retain in them.
4.0,Held up to being dropped but star hasn't held up as well.
4.0,"These are really cute in person. The fit was good. The buckles and footbed seem great, similar to Birks. Only issues are the chemical smell is really strong and the bottom of the sandals are uneven."
4.0,If you don't use a ton of credit cards and don't carry a ton of money on you this will be just fine
4.0,"Also  the chain was pretty short. Once it is safely secured, it is fine. It is heavy for a necklace. It is my birthstone, so my husband loves to see it on me."
4.0,"I ordered black but received blue, notice after a week.  Like it,  but  too heavy then my other bags."
4.0,"This is shirt is pretty great. It fits well and looks exactly like that photo. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars is because it‚Äôs kinda thin, I was expecting it to be a lot thicker. It‚Äôs stretchy which is great. I would definitely buy this again."
4.0,It was okay for the price. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. It‚Äôs thin and not very warm. I did like that it fits into a compact bag for transport.
4.0,"I like the extra zippered sections. I keep one zipped at all times with more personal items, leaving the other two sections open for quick grab items like sunglasses and keys. The bag is fairly small, making it a good choice for date night or work. Its not a bag I would grab for a longer trip out with the kids when I need to fit a million water bottles and all their other ""necessities."" Seems sturdy and good quality so far. The high contrast gold with the black is eye-catching. Overall, a great simple bag!"
4.0,Nice quility slipper
4.0,"Very comfortable. Too soon to tell about durability, but seems to be holding up very well."
4.0,Belt buckle broke after just about one year of daily use. I guess that's not bad for a $10 belt. It's not very stylish at all but it did the job. I'm buying another one today.<br /><br />Edit: Couldn't order another one as it appears it is no longer available on Amazon.
4.0,This gave me good coverage; would love to have it in other colors.
4.0,"Many loose threads and very big even after I followed the sizing. If I had the time and it wasn't a hassle, I would've returned this; however, it did work for the occasion. If you're a bigger guy you'll enjoy the purchase, as the quality of the pieces is still good. Would only recommend to someone not so slim or lean"
4.0,Great dress for $30!! Same quality you'd find at Macy's for 3x that. I thought it ran a tad small. Recommended to friends.
4.0,"Came quick , I liked what it looked like when I wore it. Stays on well. Hate to say it gets pushed to the side now, I lost interest in it after a week. Your ear will get a little sore if you wear it for 10 hours + all day"
4.0,"The product is perfect, Its a watch with lots of posseblitiesso the manaal is extended bbut at the end you have a watch  with fulfill your wishes. One super inportant thing is that  the nightlights special on this watch is perfect  Bert Geuze"
4.0,Woul be 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt adjustable
4.0,"These are so so so SO cute!!! I love owls and these are just the perfect addition to my collection of owl earrings!!! They are very heavy, which is the only reason these aren't getting a 5 star review, but I'd prefer them to be heavy rather than cheap, that's for sure!!!!!! They are definitely well made - that's for sure!!!!!"
4.0,A great purchase!
4.0,"I read the reviews on here before purchasing so i had pretty low expectations but I was happily surprised when i tried it on! It fits really well - i am 5'7 / 26"" waist / 130lb /  32C  and a small fit great. The bottoms are a little loose around the waist but i think thats so you can wear them pulled up high. I have a smallish chest but the top fit great. The only thing i dont like is that the underwire is lined with white, so i may just try and dye it cus I want the color to be a richer brown.<br /><br />For 20 bucks I am very pleased. Excited to wear this for hot girl summer woo!"
4.0,"Like the colors, haven‚Äôt tried it on yet but looks comfortable"
4.0,The pullover was very well made and I love it.
4.0,"Looks really nice, but very hard to put on with one hand, so changed the clasp.  Seems reasonably well made. Be advised that returning anything to China is really expensive, so if one of these arrives broken you'll have to fix it or throw it away."
4.0,I am giving these boots 4 out if 5 stars be cause of the calve size. I gave 21 inch diameter calves and these are snugger than I was expecting from the reviews here. I'm going to have to gradually stretch them myself or take them to be professionally done. Other than that they are great!!
4.0,"I got what I was expecting, so I am very please. This purse can be used for any occasion"
4.0,I really didn't think that this would work on me but it turned out to be pretty versatile.
4.0,"I like the fabric and color.  Bottoms a bit too long, but that's OK.<br /><br />The second pair, in purple, do not fit.  Different packaging and fabric feels different.  I am returning them."
4.0,"Based on they reviews I read, I was not sure what to expect upon receiving this product and I was honestly a little apprehensive about this dress but I decided to order anyways. I am glad that I did! the dress is very colorful and lively and it really looked beautiful on. I love the huge pick flower at the bottom. I paired this dress with a hot pink camisole because I am busty and they looked really nice together. I wore this dress to work and it was super comfortable and I felt like I was reall stylish.<br /><br />As far as why I reduced a star, it was due to this weird gathering of extra fabric in the bosom area. It was just a little too much fabric so it looked a little weird to me. This problem was easily solved with a safety pin. I simply stretched out the extra fabric and pinned it to the inside of the other side giving it a more taunt look. Overall, it was nice and it fit really well plus it is very comfotable and it isn't hot. I would recommend this product. My only issue was the extra fabric. I didn't have any holes or anything else wrong with my dress. I did receive this dress at a discount in evangelical for my honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and completely truthful. I hope you have found this review helpful."
4.0,Very nice ... fits perfectly.  Good quality material.....Will buy again from the company....a different style!
4.0,Product exactly as described.  Love the look and feel
4.0,"it took a LONG time but made it before  Halloween! And even came  w suspenders!  The only downfall is I read the previous reviews that stated theirs did not come w suspenders and order a pair m, but Overall happy w the order."
4.0,Great hat at a great price. The one thing worth mentioning is that the white portion is foam.
4.0,Collar is too small but otherwise nice.
4.0,I like the material very much.  A little big but can have that fixed.  Am very happy with this jumpsuit.
4.0,Wife put it on right away and got unsolicited compliments on it.  Winner!
4.0,"Loved the purse! Perfect size and completely adjustable. Only thing is it becomes very slick when you do over the shoulder, very annoying to have it slide all around my body"
4.0,Love it. It's beautiful on the ear. I would have given it 5 stars but the ear post arrived bent.
4.0,This is NOT cotton I don't care what it is advertised as. It is very feminine and pretty. I've received many complements on it. It is at least one size smaller than stated.
4.0,I haven't worn it yet but it is very beautiful and high quality.
4.0,"This was a gift for my adult niece and she liked it.  It was larger than expected, but pretty stones."
4.0,I order large.. but it's medium
4.0,Good fitting lenses . And lens easily leave any kind of smudge on lenses.  Good customer service though.
4.0,Cute and well-made.
4.0,"We used these to create necklaces for my daughter‚Äôs craft fair. Lots of multiple designs, but that‚Äôs ok since we could do alternating mixed metal designs of the same charm. The casting isn‚Äôt sloppy, nice edges."
4.0,"I like the quality. They are soft and warm, and look like pants. But the sizing is off. I‚Äôm in between size 8 and 10, usually buy med/large. These pants are tight even in XL size."
4.0,My grandson liked his sweater.
4.0,This is my second pair
4.0,"Great shirt. Be careful, as this shirt runs a bit small. Might want to go a size up."
4.0,fit's good
4.0,They were a little long for my liking
4.0,Its worth the price but one side is unfinished and the back are tiny and almost clear so if u drop em good luck lol
4.0,"This is the second time we bought this item.  The first one, the edges wore exposing the silver/gray metal underneath.  On the second item, we spray painted with a gloss clear coat.  It looks beautiful and hopefully it will last."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b7e41652e9a54658c8575d88fe96c4a5]] I really do love these watch bands. But I wish the quality control was a little better. I mostly wanted to try this pack because the standard rubber bands tend to irritate my wrists. I needed something that was easy to slip on and off, but would keep my wrist from getting red and itchy.<br /><br />These bands are beautifully, braided and extremely stretchy. They do tend to get dirty quickly, but you can throw them in the wash and they clean up very nicely.<br /><br />The biggest issue that I had with these bands is the one green band was coming apart at the scene before I was able to even use it. This is pretty disappointing as green is my favorite color! Since then I‚Äôve been using the tan one daily, taking it on and off a couple times throughout the day, and have had no issues with breaking! So, my guess is the damaged green band was just a fluke.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good value for money and if you‚Äôre someone with a sensitive wrist like me, you‚Äôll be very happy at the comfortability of these bands."
4.0,The glasses work great as far as sun glasses go but seem a little heavy on my nose. They may be pressing harder on my regular glasses on my nose causing the heaviness.  They do look nice and stylish.
4.0,The colors are bright but not gaudy!  This cover-up runs bigger than I thought!  I purchased an XL but could‚Äôve purchased a M or L.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 148 pounds.  I‚Äôve had 2 hip surgeries and it overs the scars beautifully!  I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars because the material is a little heavy for a bathing suit cover-up .... however makes a nice belted dress!
4.0,Great gift for my little Llama loving girl.  The shipping was actually faster than expected.  The shoes are a little bigger in the width than I was expecting but they still work just fine.
4.0,I bought these as a giveaway for a writers' conference because I always wear fascinators to conferences. They were a big hit and everyone clipped them in their hair and posed for pictures. The quality is good for the price. I would order them again for another giveaway.
4.0,"I loved the burnt orange color of the fabric, which is really on trend right now. Overall the style of the dress of cute and the fabric felt comfortable. The halter style alleviates straps slipping off shoulders, again adding to the overall comfort. The slits in the front landed a couple inches above my knee.<br /><br />There is a tiny button where the two pieces that cross the bust line intersect, which helps to prevent gaping and ""exposure."" I unbuttoned it to try it out, but the button was obvious and looks weird, so leaving it open isn't much of an option.<br /><br />Most importantly, please know this dress runs large. I really looked at the sizing chart, and it put me in the large category. I can fall into either a medium or large, depending on the dress and style, but this was gaping all around the top portion of the dress. I am 5'6"", 145lbs, approx 40C, so unless you are really busty, you may want to order a size down."
4.0,"Me encanto, muy ligeras"
4.0,The product is the same as shown in the picture
4.0,"Nice shades for 10$ The Green lens makes everyone look like grey zombies.  Fun, cool and good quality."
4.0,This swimsuit is much better then the last one I reviewed. This one still has some side boob showing but at least it holds the boobs in place.<br />Pros:<br />Straps are very cute and make the back really flattering.<br />Good color combination who doesn't like black and white<br />Made really well and feels durable<br />Fits well on the legs and butt<br />Cons:<br />Not made for the ample breasted women<br />It cuts out on the side of the breast exposing a decent amount of side boob<br />One of the straps on each sites feels like it's pulling your shoulder forward.<br />At 5'3&#34; and 132 lbs I though from the chart that the medium would be the correct size for me but I should have ordered a large.<br />I ordered this for my daughter- in-law and we had ordered several other suits. This suit fit the best other then the side of the suit by the breast toward the armpit it cuts a little deep for anyone with more then a little breast size.<br />I received this product for a discounted price or free in exchange for an unbiased review of said product. This is a really nice suit except as noted.
4.0,Kinda large. Material super stretchy. Super long
4.0,"I love this bag...would have given it 5 stars but I feel like the opening could be a bit bigger.  Otherwise, the many pouches are wonderful and it's taken a beating and still looks great!  I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a tote, but for an everyday purse, it's great!"
4.0,"LOVED it ..<br />it was short, but I am tall (6'1)<br />So I could not tie it like in the picture but looked great on !"
4.0,"First of all, I love this dress and wear it with some frequency. It works great as a professional dress (I wear it to work and wore it to a fundraiser - a brown blazer goes great with it) as well as a cocktail dress (just add bling!) or a more casual dress (cute sandals ftw). A couple of notes, it was more burnt orange than I expected (maybe a computer screen issue) at the time of purchase but I love it even more for being the color it is. Also, as I move around in it, the seams twist so that one side seam is a little more forward than it should be. This might be bad design or (more likely) might be because it is a little tight (I usually wear a M/8) in the hips. The rest of it fits great."
4.0,"So I can't speak too much on how the durability of the were, as they were all given as gifts.  These were smaller than I thought they would be, but to attach these to luggage or bags, the size is just fine."
4.0,"a bit more 'peach colored' than I wanted... photo is off a bit.  I was looking to get a 'hot pink'...<br /><br />nevertheless, the bag is pretty"
4.0,A little on the tight side as far as the shirt. But veeeeerrrrry cute. Loooots of compliments! I bought 3x which is my size. And it was tight. Pants fit good.
4.0,"These are very secure.  I can finally stop worrying about losing my diamond earrings.  Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars, is they are larger than I would like them to be, and I can see them from certain angles.  Could just be me though."
4.0,"They were a little small...if you have a rounder, larger face, I would suggest..."
4.0,Its a cute dress. Thankfully I upsized though or it would not have fit.
4.0,"Like the style, but it's a bit snug"
4.0,Lovely looking bag. Nice size and price was excellent.
4.0,"I liked everything about the product.  I tend to have a swelling problem with my ankles, so these helped a lot with that."
4.0,"Fit to loose I order a M, i think the small would of been perfect"
4.0,"So I am 5'4"" and about 220 lbs. I ordered the XXL according to the size chart because the XXL was the highest they went on the size chart and I did want true compression leggings for after my surgery, however, they are really tight in the leg part and it was difficult for me to put on without straining after my surgery. I had gallbladder surgery and the doctors restrict your weight limit to 5 lbs with no strenuous stretching so I was concerned to try and put these on cause it required me to move, wiggle and bounce around in order to get them on. Also, the stomach isnt quite as tight feeling but with this particular surgery, I was reluctant to put too much strain on my stomach to avoid soreness so I guess it will all just depend on the type of surgery you are getting on whether or not these will be good for you. They are also a bit long and I had around 5"" left on the bottom which I just rolled up. As far as opaqueness, they are not as bad as some leggings but I would still recommend wearing it with longer shirts or underneath something because there is a little see through since they are pulled so tight. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I should have probably gone with the XXXL for more comfort and ease but I wonder if they wouldn't be a true compression legging if it wasn't this tight."
4.0,"Good price and cute style -- fun to keep around as an extra pair -- however, they are not super durable so you should definitely keep them in a safe place!! That being said, with this disclaimer, I would feel comfortable recommending these glasses to friends and would probably purchase again if given the choice.<br /><br />*I received a promo code for this product but it did not affect the integrity of my review."
4.0,"The bag is excellent. I would have given 5 stars, but the bag came with a warning about materials that cause cancer. After checking. I was advised to wipe down the bag and It should be fine."
4.0,HAPPY WITH IT
4.0,"Going by the size chart, I ordered one size larger than I normally wear.  The suit was still a bit small,  especially in the top part.<br />I can wear the suit - it's just more snug than I prefer."
4.0,"Cute dress, runs small I'm 5'5 130 pounds and the medium was very tiny.<br /><br />The material is very light/thin but not see through, almost like a dry-fit material. Great for a trip as it doesn't take up much space and wont wrinkle."
4.0,"The quality of these compared to others I purchased at the same time from a different manufacturer is just not as great.<br /><br />One sock already has a hole in it from one wearing and a wash.  More importantly, they just don't feel quite as comfortable versus other brand.  They fit a little tight and are a little too thin - as I'd prefer slightly thicker material.<br /><br />However, overall they do work well to provide a sock that doesn't show so in that sense they do the job.<br /><br />I'm just comparing with others that are almost ideal so that's the downside.<br /><br />These did fit me, although barely (size 10).  Worth the price, given they are not expensive!"
4.0,Looks nice and it‚Äôs soft material
4.0,"Cute BoHo style dress. I had ordered a simlar dress from a different manufacture which fit perfectly. The stress was very tight in the chest. The color seemed a little different than what is shown online But not tremendously off. Maybe the color just didn‚Äôt look good on me and because it was far too tight, I just wasn‚Äôt happy with it."
4.0,"the inside is fuzzy which can make you hot fast in the summer , its really soft though. I would have picked a different fabric, but I didn't return it because it will be nice in Cali winter :)"
4.0,This dress is very comfortable
4.0,"Not for big people, very unique, I ordered it for me and gave it to my wife, she is happy, I ordered a different one"
4.0,"Not the best quality, but cute and perfect for a snow day.. (:"
4.0,"I get tons of compliments on this hat! However, it gets lots of fabric balls all over after a while."
4.0,"I already own one of these, but the place where I first purchased it, was out. Decided to check out Amazon and found these. Bought a size up for a looser fit as I want them for bed. Perfect! Nice, soft and very light. Packaging was great and delivered on time. Only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the price. I feel it's a &#34;bit&#34; high - I paid $3.99 for the one I already had.  Even though, due to the comfort level, I would def. buy again if my regular place is out."
4.0,"Comfortable, fit as I expected .Perfect for workouts!<br />Material is thinner material compared to other sports bras - but still comfortable"
4.0,Great quality but runs really small. I‚Äôm a curvy 10 and the extra large was too small.
4.0,Got it for my fiance. He got a  little potbelly and wide neck for a 5'6&#34; guy so i got a size 16 Neck/33 Sleeve. He looks heavy and it doesnt compliment his shape. Its somewhat straight shape. If the waist is a little slim (just a little because that'll be a slim fit if we want a very defined waist) it could look a little better.
4.0,"Bought for my husband to carry his stuff in for a trip and when it arrived it was much smaller than expected. My fault for not reading carefully enough. I thought it was like the full size bag but with one strap instead of 2. It is too small for his 11"" tabelt in it's case."
4.0,"Got it in a timely matter! I got these for a gift for my husband, their was some glasses that was small and 3 fit perfectly on him. I wish it was bigger these are like the John Lennon or ozzy Osborne glasses! Very stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4.0,Was very happy with the way it fit only thing was the arm holes could have fit a little tighter...but nothing to complain about. Colors were beautiful
4.0,"Christmas gift, winner!"
4.0,"Have not had a chance to install these yet but given that they are of the same brand and stock as the 20mm that I bought a couple of months ago, they are bound to be good, strong and durable with tight tolerances.<br />I've enough trust in these to have installed a set onto my Hamilton khaki."
4.0,"I got these for dermatitis and psoriasis flareups my feet have from time to time. If your feet are suffering, these are more gentle putting on and taking off than normal socks. There is less stickage to the broken skin, etc.<br /><br />In my case, flareups are exacerbated by sweat and contact dermatitis. These socks are better for both, first by wicking sweat better than cotton socks, and second by being hypo-allergenic.<br /><br />I'm lucky that I don't have to wear these all the time, but just when my feet are getting iffy. But if you did have to wear them ever day, you're good. These look and wear like regular socks, but they really are a relief on bad days."
4.0,Wish strap was a little longer but I love it!
4.0,My girlfriend loves how it fits and says is really confortable. The only down of it is a small hole in the glute part. Other than that great
4.0,"I ordered these glasses thinking they were the same as a previous pair, but there were slightly different and for the better. They were of better construction and fit nicely. Thanks."
4.0,Very cute and very small.
4.0,"My husband loves the watch band, but he had to create more holes, it was pretty large for him. I will add he has small wrists, so for a normal or meaty wrist it will be great."
4.0,Simple yet stylish design.. the only thing that i dont like about this watch is the leather strap
4.0,These pieces are absolutely beautiful. The only thing to pay attention to is the size of the necklace pendant as this may be too large depending on your preference. A great buy nevertheless.
4.0,"The hat looks good but the sticker of FI Collection doesn't have good quality, so it's better if you remove it.<br />I appreciate that the hat came in a box."
4.0,Pretty.  Arrived on time
4.0,Pockets! Feel of the dress. I usually get a M dress and this dress was a tad loose. I wish I got a small. There is a zipper on the side to use but I didn‚Äôt need it since it‚Äôs loose.
4.0,Happy with purchase. Very pretty and product has held up after many wears. Has not faded or broken and I have worn many times. Really like the extender chain to adjust the length.
4.0,very pleased with the product. it was what I thought and expected.  the recipient of the gift was happy too.
4.0,"For a casual and affordable belt, you can't beat it."
4.0,Fits smaller but good quality
4.0,Okay but not as comfortable as I expected...
4.0,Right fit and looks Awesome!
4.0,"I've previously owned a pair of these bought in a reef outlet.  I got them in expecting them to fit exactly like my others. It took a couple days to break in and get use to the feel of wearing them again.  The arch is something to get use to, but it's not a factor anymore. Love them!"
4.0,Not great but good with price. Flexible.
4.0,Break really easy.
4.0,"this shirt is big on me , this is not for skinny people"
4.0,My daughter loved this necklace. It is the color of her birthstone. Excellent!! Will order again in the future. thanks
4.0,"The elastic strings that fit over the ears are a little short, even at full extension.  Until I everstretched them, they would bend my ears, making them look like cauliflower ears. Otherwise,  they are quite good."
4.0,Nicely made.  I just ordered too large a size.
4.0,Good tint & decent graphics for the price.
4.0,I got these as almost a joke for me and my husband and put them in his Christmas stocking as a funny.  I do like them through and they are cute and easy to put on and wear.
4.0,"Not the sturdiest, but cool nevertheless."
4.0,"This is an all-season funeral dress for me.  I have tried on a lot of other dresses for this very purpose, and they don't work. They are either too skin-tight, too low cut, too short, too long,  too 'night on the town' or too casual.<br /><br />The downsides of the dress: I wish the sleeve was a bit longer; however, I knew this when I bought it. The material is a bit on the heavy side; I knew this as well. Finally, the bodice is a bit loose. The sizing is weird too, because of ""China."" I wear an XL or a 0X if I shop somewhere like Macy's; for things like a cotton t-shirt that will shrink, I'll get an XXL or a 1X. I don't shop at any of the specialty stores for plus sizes. That being said, I got a 2XL and it fits. Go figure.<br /><br />Now, the upsides: very classy and pretty. It seems well made, is modest and isn't too casual. I expect that the material will be a bit heavy if I wear it on a humid 85+ degree day. Since it's a tiny bit large on top for me that means it's not super tight-fitting across the back, which I like. You can wear it with a more casual belt to dress it down, or a nicer belt to dress it up, or with a cardigan.  It's a good length, and I don't plan on getting any kind of crinoline to wear with it; the dress is fine without it. It's also forgiving in terms of any kind of figure flaws you have in your midsection.<br /><br />I am VERY hard to please in terms of dresses, and this one is definitely a keeper. This does hit all the marks, and if I could give it a 4.5, I would. The only real downsides are the heavier material, the sleeve length and the fact a that Chinese sizes are so different from typical American sizes. I would advise sizing according to your waist size; that's what I did, and it fits fine."
4.0,I received this a while ago and just now reviewing it. It is made very well with non-stretch material and fits as it should depending on your personal style and size. I like it!
4.0,Really nice set to dress up or wear casual - great price!
4.0,I like the shirt.  Just got it for wearing around the house or out camping.  If I order again I‚Äôll order a size larger (a 2X)I usually wear an XL. This one ran on the small side.
4.0,Fits great except in the bust area. It's a little tight there.
4.0,"Nice beanie for my husband,  warm too!"
4.0,"Great color, fabric and patterns just a little tight in the cuff. I would definitely order them again."
4.0,The quality looks good and soft
4.0,I like the soft material but it is. Little big for me and tough to stay up. I‚Äôm thinking it would fit a guy better
4.0,like the material fit is alittle tite
4.0,looks very good thank u
4.0,"Cute pleated skirt with the obligatory 'Japan schoolgirl' white block stripes. Material and stitching are consistent and sturdy; the material is a fairly standard cotton, not too soft but not too scratchy. It feels like it costs a bit more, but only because it costs so little!<br /><br />Got it for the wife with measurements<br />Height: 158cm // 5' 2&#34;<br />Weight: ~61kg // 135lb<br />Bust:  86cm // 34&#34;<br />Waist: 74cm // 29&#34;<br />Hip:  96cm // 38&#34;<br /><br />And it fits well along the hips and ends several inches above the knee, but below fingertips when arms are to the side."
4.0,"I saw one of these in a cab. Since I hate pulling down the visor--it makes me feel like I'm looking through a gunslit--I wanted to try this.<br /><br />It works. It barely fit on the visor of my Sienna, which is relatively wide; might want to check measurements before buying.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is shiny, so there's some glare off it when it's not deployed. And because it's flexible, it vibrates with the road, so that glare is moving. This hasn't been a big problem, but if I were on a long trip on a bright day, I might wind up taking it off until I needed it, not sure."
4.0,This hat fits my 2.5 year old toddler perfectly and I like that it is cotton.
4.0,It's a cute bracelet and I like it.  I have to keep tightening it on my wrist but it's ok.
4.0,"This is a nice, well made bracelet.  It fit well (has the adjustable string), and felt good on my wrist."
4.0,The fit is larger than expected. It is not as warm as I had hope for but will be fine.
4.0,"like them as they are thin and really good summer socks, these are a mix between a regular cotton sock and a pantyhose."
4.0,Liked the shirt and sending back for a larger size.  Nice quality and fast shipping.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute. They replied fast with sizing. Minus one star because the first picture is NOT the same as the others. And the first pic is NOT what you get. The bow you get looks like the 2,3,4 picture."
4.0,"This is a pretty dress and it is very cute if you are looking for a sleeveless conservative option. It was perfect for a cocktail wedding, where you want to look nice, but not draw any attention away from the the bride! I have a long torso, and the waistline sat closer to my ribs. I think this is a very flattering dress if you are shorter and curvy. Not the best choice for tall and thin. Great price, good quality, pretty pattern."
4.0,Order 1 size big than tou are kind fit like dickies
4.0,Fit great wife loves them
4.0,They fall very easy and they get lost fast
4.0,not an expensive look at all
4.0,"This is a great lightweight vest for biking, visible, pockets....  It runs about 1 size too small however.  If you wear a Large, order a XL, XL, order a 2XL...  Bummed about the sizing but great vest for the money."
4.0,I ENJOY THE RING IT IS COMFORTABLE TO WEAR --JUST WISH IT WAS A LITTLE SMALLER IT TWISTS ON MY FINGER. THE VALUE WAS GREAT.
4.0,"I like big sweatshirts to layer, this one isn't that big (smaller than other brands in same size). It's comfortable and washes well. Good value."
4.0,Cute earrings and nice quality. Look like the picture
4.0,"Great for cool, windy rides. Great ease of movement. Super for US southern winters. They run very small. At 5' 8&#34; 155 lbs. I wear XL in this brand with gel cushioned shorts underneath. The medium was way too small."
4.0,"I really like it. The sinching mechanism on the back holds fine, but it would be better if it held tighter."
4.0,"It is small and cute, like I wanted. But the points are a bit pointy. Especially at night because I dont take it off when I sleep. I didn't even think about it when I saw the picture. Over all I like it though and I am very happy to continue to wear it."
4.0,Fits good and very comfortable
4.0,"Very nice dress. I bought the Small and the fit was perfect. I'm 5' 7"" and 140lbs and usually run between small and medium. Material is not too light and you can either dress this up or down. Will most likely be purchasing another colour soon."
4.0,Lovely necklace!  It matches practically all clothes that I have.
4.0,"Cure bracelets, the packet comes with one brown and one black. The only small complaint I have is that it does not smell very good but I think this will go away with time. both bracelets are nice with a functional buckle made out of a magnet which makes it easy to  hook and unhook the bracelet by your own. this is kind of a smart choice to use magnets as it is always hard to wear these kinds of bracelets on your own.<br />I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,This dress was just a tad too small but over all I love it. The colors are so bright and the material is also amazing. I would suggest that if you are kind of top heave ( BIG BOOBS) then just go a size up.
4.0,Bought these for my newborn. Cute but very big
4.0,Looks great!!  look forward to combining it with my other bracelets!
4.0,"I give these earrings three stars only because they are very cute ,but I wasn't expecting the orange color on the ones I purchased to be such a bright color. Overall a was pleased."
4.0,"better quality than I expected.  I had to return and reorder because I originally got a L after reading reviews that say it ran very small.  I wear a size 4 and normally wear a small in clothes but a M in swim suits so I went up a size from swim suit size.  It was way too big.  I reordered in a M and it fits but I probably could have gone with a S.  My advice, if you get free returns order more than one size and return what does not work :)"
4.0,"This dress is super cute! I received several compliments on it!  It is quite versatile and can be worn to work with a blazer or for a night out. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 125lb and ordered a medium."
4.0,"The dress is great for the price. The material is on the thinner side. It wrinkles very easily. The color is a bit more army/olive green than I expected. It came across just a bit brighter in my display, but still pretty and flattering."
4.0,Isn't as sturdy as I hoped. As long as you are gentle it should last a while. May end up having to add glue. Good product for the price
4.0,I really like these lightweight fingerless gloves!  They are perfect for protecting my hands from blisters when I bike. I also use them when I hike with poles. They are absorbent so if my palms sweat I‚Äôm still comfortable. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give them 5 stars is because I find the little loops on the middle two fingers to be useless in helping to remove the gloves. The half fingers still turn inside out. I haven‚Äôt tried washing them yet but I‚Äôm sure if I hand wash them they‚Äôll do fine.
4.0,Ordered for my daughter. Super cute dress. Runs small though. She‚Äôs an 8-10 and I had to order a 10-12 so it wasn‚Äôt so tight on her torso and armpits.
4.0,They do a good job of covering my face.  I do have to take off my glasses and put them back on though.
4.0,Love the dress good material
4.0,"Nice pants but elastic around waste isn't not very good, so always have to keep pulling it up its not fitted well"
4.0,"I like the colors and the horizontal stripes.  I did get an XS but the only reason it works for me is that I have narrow shoulders.  If you don't have narrow shoulders I could see needing to size up to accommodate that.<br />It's a stretchy poly material.  Cute and what I wanted.<br />I""m updating my reviews and I added a star.  This striped tee is so cute.  I like it a lot and it matches so many things because of the varied colors in the shirt.  I wore it with a pair of wide legged denim-colored capris and a pair of khaki shorts and I can't decide which of the two looks/colors was my favorite, but definitely like boht.<br />Again, I have a  narrow upper body and the xs small fits as I wanted it to which is a fitted look - no bagginess.  If you want bagginess definitely order bigger than your regular size."
4.0,Everything is as mentioned except the fog and the rubber is a little bit easy to unattached.
4.0,"Beautiful, I bought the white one in Small and it fits perfect ; the white is see-through though.  The only think I don't like is the buttons, although they look nice, they make the shirt very hard to button up if you are in a hurry or if you have long nails."
4.0,"Very pretty, maybe a little big."
4.0,I bought these shoes for my grandbaby so all of those questions are really based on what I thought. The fit was good. He has very fat feet and these shoes open up wide to fit him perfect. I bought the size shoe that he is in now and it fit just fine.
4.0,"fits well, looks good east to buy."
4.0,"Not quite as good as OEM, but a good substitute for sure. I followed a YouTube video to remove my old wrist straps and to use rubber cement adhesive to install the new straps. I should get another couple of years out of my Fitbit Surge."
4.0,"I'm about 5ft 7in, 140lbs and I believe I bought this in a medium, Amazon even said that it would be the best size for me given my order history. It's a bit too large to really squish down and smooth out my tummy though. It really just adds another layer, which does smooth a bit but I wanted something tighter. No idea if a small would fit or be too tight.<br /><br />I do really love the boning in this, it's super comfortable! The material is really thick and well made too. I'll probably go back and try a smaller size in the future because I do really like it quality wise."
4.0,Satisfying gift.
4.0,"I fit perfectly but when I got it the zipper was stuck, but after a few uses, the zipper fixed itself"
4.0,Very good quality knitted hat. Fits a bit small.
4.0,Decent sock but it was too large for anyone in my household to use. I passed it on to a relative and he likes them. Says they don't show but wick just fine and they wash well.
4.0,Leg holes are a little tight and the waist band was loose. I could see this being good as a maternity suit. Wish the top and bottom came separate for sizing reasons.
4.0,"I bought a pair similar to this one last year; it was very durable which is why I went for it again this year.  However, I did not give it Five Stars because it is extremely heavy; my daughter has not worn it yet this year I am certain because of said reason.  I would suggest that the manufacturer considers using lighter material with the same durability."
4.0,Nice top but it was way too big for me ...
4.0,Beautiful piece - a little larger than I expected.
4.0,A little long. Adding a Petite selection would be nice.
4.0,Great buy for anyone looking for an alternate to the more expensive &#34;Miraflex&#34; that runs well into 200+ just for the frame
4.0,"This is super cute but definitely size up 1-2 sizes. My daughter is a juniors medium so I purchased a large, it fit but wasn't very roomy. I feel like the XL would have been better. Good quality though, and it looked nice."
4.0,Nice comfy dress.  Casual and relaxing.
4.0,Fits nice and looks exactly like the photo. It does remind me of a chef's hat though when I wear it.
4.0,With me having a 40ddd bra I Ordered the 3xl. Very tight around chest. Material is itchy. But manageable. Material seems pretty sturdy. Wasn't sure if I would be able to get it off with it so tight but it wasn't too bad. Overall happy with hat I need it for. It is very short though.
4.0,Dress fit nice!
4.0,"Upon washing this product, I was dismayed at the terrible amount of wrinkling that occurred. I had a feeling when I first opened the packaged that that would be the case, but I thought I'd wash it and see. While the shirt itself fit okay, the ""wrinklability"" was a big no-no for me. I returned it the next day. If you don't mind a serious ironing job, though, this shirt is well-made and very professional in appearance. I also like the fact that it does not have anti-wrinkle chemicals; I just don't have the time right now to spend on ironing shirts for work every day."
4.0,"This was a gift, but the recipient wears them quite often. Not a bad deal for the price/quality."
4.0,"I ordered this a little larger thinking I needed it to fit like it does on the model (which I have had to do before when ordering online) but it wasn't necessary. It's a little too big, but its okay. Order the size that you would normally get and know that it will still fit like the model. The fabric is nice and soft. Looks cute with tight jeans and jean shorts!"
4.0,Awesome shorts but smaller than expected otherwise it would be 5 stars
4.0,"This dress is large, I ordered a medium and it's still kinda big, but I'm hoping a few washes with fix that. The only real down size is how RIDICIOUSLY long this dress is. I will have to hem it, or there is no way to wear it, it's just crazy."
4.0,I like the shoes in my son also liked them but they just ran bigger than normal. So we had to return them for another shoe but in all happy with the purchase and return.
4.0,"I was expectjng a blue watch face and got pink. That's alright tho. My daughter just loves wearing a watch and the variety of charms is perfect for a 5yo with changing interests. I also love how easy it is to set the time.<br /><br />4 stars because the back of the watch isn't very secure. It's easy enough to put back on, but I almost lost it when changing out a link because it wasn't secure. I'm not sure if it was a bumpy shipping process or what, but I just hope it doesn't pop off during regular wear."
4.0,"has stretchy fabric, not cotton."
4.0,"Great wrist band... The only issue was that there are no instructions. Maybe easy for most people but it took me some time to figure it out. If anyone needs help or instructions, just ask."
4.0,"With some exceptions, reviewing a Quartz watch is all about aesthetics. Even the cheapest quartz movement will outperform most mechanical movements in terms of timekeeping accuracy. The cost and value in a simple, analog, quartz watch come from its dial, case, and band.<br /><br />With this Relic Aldridge watch, you get what you see, but maybe a little less. The style of the case is meant to emulate the rotating bezel of a diver's watch, but in fact is just a fixed design meant to make the watch look tougher than it is. Rated at only 50m of water resistance, this is certainly no diving watch, and the faux diver's bezel makes the watch look a little cheap.<br /><br />The thick case and metal band are solid, with a good heft. The band latches cleanly, and looks great, and the large watch face matches the current trend toward larger watches. The face looks as pictured, with minimal lume that I wouldn't rely on at night or in the dark.<br /><br />Ultimately, the aesthetics of the watch are a personal choice, and this one looks pretty much exactly as pictured, with a solid weight that will give the illusion that its pricier than it is. Nonetheless, I can't get past the fake bezel, which sufficiently cheapens the look of the watch that I can't give it five stars."
4.0,"I love the signature comfort of Saucony.  However,I found that this particular type runs shorter than their others.  I always wear an 8 in Saucony, but with the Grid Phantom I should have ordered a size 8.5.<br />I'll keep them because I use them for work and not workouts."
4.0,"The shoes run small so size up a half size, I normally wear 7 but got 7.5 and it's a good size. The sole is comfortable but the black part is a little stiff so i would suggest wearing them around with socks to break them in so they stretch out a little, I got a blister on the top of my foot. Now that they're stretched out they seem like they're gonna be good though."
4.0,Just received them today. They are super cute however the purple circle things that are on them fell right off as soon as I took them out of the package. My daughter doesn‚Äôt seem to mind and says they are comfortable.
4.0,"Great glasses, very stylish. However they are very reflective when taking pictures."
4.0,"Had to purchase new luggage and had a limited budget so I bought these. Very pleased with them. Now they may not be as sturdy as a high end set would be but for a short fix these are worth the purchase. I would imagine these will last me a couple more trips and had turned out to be better quality than I expected. I was worried about the wheels not being very strong but they all worked, although I need to add that I didn't overload any of the suitcases.! Not a bad purchase!!"
4.0,"I cant wait to wear this on an upcoming vacation. The other reviewers were right it does run smaller, but I adjusted before I ordered so mine came in perfect! I went up one full size and I am very happy with the product. The red is definitly a dark coral, but I liked so its ok, but if your looking for actual red, this is not it. Thicker fabric than expected.  All in all a good buy!"
4.0,they are perfects for small piercings
4.0,I was very impressed by the quality of these hats.  They were sturdy and comfortable for the kids to wear.  They sat a little crooked at times but did not effect the looks of the outfit.  Recommend if needed for a costume or dress-up.
4.0,My package arrived as you can see my pictures but nothing broken inside the box. That's the reason why you lose my 1 star.
4.0,"I've been wearing my bracelet for a few weeks now and it is holding up great.<br />It looks really well made.<br />I wish the little charm was of heavier construction, but like I said it is holding up well.<br />I gave one to my friend with cancer and she hasn't taken it off since I gave it to her.<br />I think this was a nice way to support my friend."
4.0,Honestly this has easily become my new favorite.<br />That being said be mindful the price is indicative of quality.<br />For what I paid though im honestly in love. üòª<br />Feel is super comfy ! Soft inside and sleek exterior. Hood is slightly oversized which was a bonus for me!<br />Color is stunning! I live in a warm all most desert climate and this is perfect for cooler evenings! So many compliments. üíï<br /><br />Few minor drawbacks ive noticed.<br />Theres only 3 buttons. Somehow i overlooked that. üòÇ<br />So like... My whole tum is sticking out. üòÖüòÖ<br />When the material is stretched it has a weird inner layer that shows very apparently. I tried to get a pic but its not a great one. Since this fits me well it doesnt stretch much to show that but i did notice it was a thing.<br />Lastly being that 3 buttons is dumb to me i hardly button it yet the too one looks about to rip through. Not sure on durability of buttons if theyre used more than Im using them which isnt much.
4.0,"It is heavier than I expected. Wouldn't stay up with just putting it over my ears, I had to tie the strings together behind my head. I also painted some more detail on it, came pretty plain. Otherwise I really liked how it looked and wore it comfortably for a few hours."
4.0,"Fits to size, could use more arch support. But I was looking more for white tennis shoes than anything else."
4.0,I like and is also Comfortable nice
4.0,Very soft and confy!
4.0,I liked the earrings but gave them to my granddaughter because they were very small.  I like small earring but this was too small.  Great quality.  My only reason for giving 4 starts is because of the size.  Should show on a person.
4.0,"Nice band with strong magnetic attachments. Still getting used to how the band fits best and will see how it holds up over time, but starting out it's great!"
4.0,Didn't realize it wasn't fitted.  Just a large scarf.
4.0,"I really like this dress. It is extremely comfortable. It is that dress you can throw on and wear to a picnic or BBQ with flat shoes and still have a sexy look. You can also dress it up with accessories and heels. It is a very versatile piece.<br /><br />The one downside is that it is designed to fit sizes M-2XL. Honestly, that is a huge range of sizes for one dress to accommodate. In my opinion, it may be appropriate for sizes Medium-Large. Even though the string does pull and allow it to draw for various sizes it looks best when the drawstring is not extended out to the max.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good piece. Just be mindful of the (sort of) one size fits all model they are using when sizing.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my review. With that being said, that did not in any way influence my opinion of the product. This review is my honest opinion of the product. I rely on reviews to make most of my online purchases and value them tremendously."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely stunning in person. I ordered an XL, but it fit more like a Large. I gave this dress to my daughter, because, let's face it- it was going to end up in her closet anyways. It did come with a snag right in front- right below the tank part, at the top of the skirt. I was unable to exchange this during the return period because this print and size were not available. I really wish I had been able to exchange it when the dress was in stock. My daughter doesn't like wearing belted dresses, but she is going to have to wear a dress with this one, since there is a hole right in the front center. Really pretty dress, otherwise."
4.0,These are nice socklettes.  A little small but stretchy.  I like them for smaller shoes.
4.0,"I lost a pin off my backpack using the rubber backing mount that came with it so I bought these to not make the same mistake twice. So far they've held up really well. I've walked around and rode my electric scooter around campus with multiple pins on my backpack and they've all held up. My only suggestions are to not lose the included allen wrench, and make sure if you unscrew these backs to not unscrew too far or you'll lose one of the parts and you'll be down one pin back. But you get several per purchase so don't worry too much about it."
4.0,In the images it looks like a peach and aqua green or blue. I didn‚Äôt mind because I‚Äôm using the dress for a gender reveal party. But it came In Perfect Baby Blue And Pink! I Love It. Dress looks fluffy in images but it‚Äôs not fluffy so I had to buy a petticoat or you may know of it as a line ruffle it made it look much more beautiful. Also I attached extra clips on the back bow because it comes with a small one but the bow is to heavy so I kinda fixed it the way I liked it. Overall Beautiful Dress You Get what you pay for (:
4.0,Just got dress today. Color is off a bit. Kind of drabby blue not Royal like in picture A bit on the large size also. There was a smell upon opening the package hoping it will go away and shrink just a little when I wash it because I really like the dress.
4.0,Cheep box for a gift. No description. Junk chain. Must been from China ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4.0,"This lace waist shaper is amazing!<br /><br />Very thick quality material. Bonus is the lace that makes it appear and also feel sexy. The hooks are well secured and this item doesn't feel cheap at all.<br /><br />It covers from my lower hips to right under my bra so there thankfully aren't any awkward gaps or bulges visible when wearing this item under my clothing. It ticks all the jiggly bits in and makes me look shapely and amazing.<br /><br />My only complaint is I measures my waist and ordered the correct size but it seems to run a tiny bit big. I was hoping to start on the largest hook and work my way in but instead I can wear this on the tightest hook already. I'll definitely keep this around to wear for posture (I had back surgery 3 years ago and this helps immensely). Also for if going out and am wearing something tight and want to be tucked in.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount for an honest review. I would purchase again, just in one size smaller than it states."
4.0,"Nice shorts, a bit small/short"
4.0,I am an adult but have a pretty small head compared to most and these look pretty dumb on me. BUT they do the job of blocking the blue light and you can definitely tell they work
4.0,"(review by 15 year old daughter) This shirt is so cute and comfortable! I loved the fit of it. The only thing that I dislike about it is that the material is pretty thin, but it works really well with a tank top underneath."
4.0,better than the cheap ones
4.0,I really love this shirt but it is waaaaayy too small and I ordered a medium like I always do so it should have fit.
4.0,Fun key chain for cat lovers. Decent details of the cat for the price.
4.0,Nice bag for kids.
4.0,"UPDATE:  I just received the bag in pink.  I AM DISGUSTED.  Idk if I got lucky with the gray bag or if this is a fluke that it's so wrong?  But this handbag has clearly been used before I received it!  It has blue from an ink pen in several places on the bag.  Also, there is a beautiful, long, brunette strand of hair stuck in the seaming along the side of the bag.  ITS GOING BACK ASAP.  Of course Amazon won't simply send a replacement bag b/c they only &#34;fulfill&#34; it.  Now I get to go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a refund.  There was no benefit in this particular instance, to being a Prime member.  If I want it replaced I need to reorder and put another $40 on my credit card.  Lesson learned.  Next time, no review until all purchases made and received.<br /><br />Great bag.  The only negative is that I wish all the pockets were deeper.  The inside pockets should always be extra deep (long) as we ladies have things to take along like phones, mani utensils and rollerball perfumes (typically long and skinny) etc. It's very frustrating to attempt to stand an item on end only to have it be too tall for the pocket and have it fall out! That said, this handbag is excellent.  I got the gray and the pink.  I do wish the pink was also offered in a softer, even pastel, shade and also that you offered other light colors.  Beige, yellow or summer white would be great.  I wanted a summer color and this is the closest thing you offer. I do like the variety and number of pockets.  This is essential, especially outside pockets.  The more the better as far as I'm concerned!  But what I really appreciate are the convertible straps.  Although this bag is described as being every kind of strap (messenger, shoulder strap, backpack) except a sling, this is mostly how I carry it.  I am 5' tall and pretty small and it does not overwhelm me.  I find the 12&#34; x 12&#34; size is just about perfect for my stature.  I spent a considerable amount of time on Amazon looking for the perfect bag (size, color, shape, convertibility and of course pockets), made from this material.  Although I usually prefer a leather bag the rest of the year, I do like to switch it up (and save $)  in the Spring and Summer and try other materials.  The quality of this man made leather is very good.  It truly looks like the real thing.  Oh and the zippers and especially the pulls are very nice.  The darker almost hematite color is a nice change from typical silvertone hardware."
4.0,love it but runs small
4.0,Not bad if your planning on using them in your ears. Definitely advise against using them in your septum. the saddles were too steep and sliced open the inside of my nostril. Ended up trimming them down a bit.
4.0,Very flattering fit. The fabric is very thick so it does take awhile to dry
4.0,Gorgeous earrings but they were too big :(
4.0,Really liked it. I use it as a night wear. It‚Äôs very comfortable and not thin
4.0,"Exceeded my expectations at this price.  More importantly, my wife is happy too  :)  clasp is fine, ring is attaches to is OK but nothing special."
4.0,"This is a very beautiful bracelet, high quality...nothing to complain except, at 8.5 length is very large."
4.0,Cumple con lo expuesto por el fabricante
4.0,"Good mask. but stinky and needed surgery for breathability.  Order enough ahead so that you can let it air out. If you do not cut open the mouth and expand the air holes in the nose, you may faint. Looked fine when I did that. Smells like petrochemicals not curing latex, not sure why."
4.0,"The window is a little low for me. Im 6'3"""
4.0,Cute earrings. They are light and look really pretty on.
4.0,It's very comfortable and good for the price.
4.0,Love the colors. Material is not strong. Has no grip(doesn't hug my feet or toes).
4.0,"A beautiful, unique design. Fits as expected. A bit long for me so I will have to have it hemmed. Still love it. No elastic."
4.0,I'm using these for safety glasses in my backpack. They fit the glasses perfectly and 3 different colors for the price is a real value. These are not very sturdy so I wouldn't trust them with expensive glasses.
4.0,"They're nice shorts, very vibrant in color just not fond of the material."
4.0,Great material. It is not sheer so your bra will not show. Has a good bit of stretch.  It is not as baggy as the picture shows.
4.0,"Good quality. They bunch a little at the ankles, even after I tried to pull up higher. I am petite though but I chose the correct height, weight range."
4.0,looks and feels real silver
4.0,The pearls are worth the buy. It's lovely but if your hands are fat don't buy the bracelet.  But I love them and I know when I wear them there will be lots of compliments.
4.0,"form the 3 colors, 2of them were right except for the gray color I did not get it. I got black stayed.  I need the gray color, I will get black in a different order. I just order another set."
4.0,The quality is great except for the fact that the size is a little off. Nothing my  seamstress can't correct though.
4.0,If it had pockets it would be perfect.  Otherwise I love it.
4.0,Didnt realize how WHITE it was but that's probably on me. Overall good bag and it has so many pockets which make organization nice and easy!
4.0,Very impressed with my boots the fit was perfect.<br />And also with the material of the boots!<br />Highly recommend üëç<br />Will order again  looking for the Grey Boots!
4.0,"Lovely hoodie. Silky thick stuff, very cozy and beautiful vivid colors. But do buy a size up! I definitely should have bought 13-14 for my tall 9 year old (normally buy size 10)."
4.0,"Nice.  Would like a little more sparkle, and thought it would be a little bigger - like the murano glass ones. Still love it.  My special bead for rewarding myself - yeah to me for my successful weight loss goal!"
4.0,"These are well-made and attractive sunglasses that I will probably keep in a vehicle to wear on short drives when the sun is in my eyes. A debatable feature, for me, is the tightness of the temples, which curve inward on their hinges - on my big head, this is a tight fit and distinctly uncomfortable after more than ~15 minutes or so of wearing. They won't slip off as easy as some, but I certainly don't want to wear these for an extended period of time!"
4.0,"I am a 32C and usually wear a size M for sports bras. Based on the reviews, I got a large. Glad I did because this does run small."
4.0,Giftable. It would had been excellent if it had a zipper.
4.0,I ordered a size up but the waist was too big while the legs fit perfect. Don‚Äôt think my body was made for these. But they are hella nice quality!!! Wish they worked for me!!
4.0,This is a very nice dress! It looks great on however the top is a little small so I had to wear something underneath so everything stays in.
4.0,Was a gift for my hair stylist and she loved it
4.0,"I like the bands. Very comfortable. Sturdy, but I thought it would be thicker"
4.0,"Purchased 4 more after using a pair for my Olympic Triathlon, Very comfortable, fits around my eyes without having to adjust once I start to swim, easier to see, did not leak, my only concern is I would like to see the back clip be made with something other then a plastic clip."
4.0,Super cute but unfortunately did not fit my piercing. It is a true 10mm.
4.0,I love the coat but after only a few months the zipper broke on it and now I have to pay to get that fixed
4.0,These are pretty big . Truly aviator size glasses size . Now hopefully the contact points where they clamp to your glasses wont get marred like  my last pair  of these type did to my glasses .  But the marred spots are not within your normal field of view  unless your looking to the  very extreme  left or right.  But I do find these flip up styles to be very handy for my application.
4.0,The watch is beautiful. It looks just like the picture. It's a little too big and I have to remove a few links. I've also had to reset the time a few times as well.
4.0,Needs more chest and stomach room for the larger sizes
4.0,"Nice band, sturdy and beautiful. Can snag or damage your clothes"
4.0,I was really excited to get the chance to review this headband. My honest option is this is great head band it very warm. It holds your hair In place. It's very nice specially if you want to go outside and it's cold out. I even decided to wear it where working out but it was too warm for that.
4.0,"We were meant to be a family of hippies and this outfit was supposed to be a part of daughters Halloween costume. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to dress up this year so I didn‚Äôt even try it on but it looked exactly like the picture, pretty Cute!"
4.0,"Love this dress.  Can't beat the price for the look.  So unique, stylish and edgy. I received many compliments on this dress<br /><br />Its a pretty rose gold color.  It is very short in the front but luckily i had boy shorts to wear and was able to pull it down to keep it looking decent. It needs at least 2 more inches in the front to have better coverage. If you are curvy and have thick thighs and butt i would suggest to get a large.  I'm 5'5"" 145lbs and got a medium.  It just fit me.  Sleeves came to my wrists. Not short on me like other people commented<br /><br />Train was slightly long but not unmanageable.  I had 3.5"" heels that helped with the train a little. Also glad it was fully lined so it wasn't itchy"
4.0,"I really like the style of clothes this company's making... I've ordered three dresses now. The product is sometimes quirky. For instance on this one, two of the button holes were too small, and were left unbuttoned. I fixed them myself. I like the uniqueness of it. So I'll keep buying from them."
4.0,The shorts are shorter than they used to be. I preferred the slightly longer style.
4.0,"The zipper didn‚Äôt last long, BUT the dress is comfortable and beautiful! I will still order another one because it‚Äôs affordable."
4.0,"Works great. Warning: If you have small wrists, the excess will stick out a bit. Not a big deal, but for some people, this might be an issue."
4.0,I loved this. My kids wore it too when they couldn't find their hats on vacation
4.0,"Whish I could buy one same designs for 3 to 4 pairs. It works great. My boy tried this on on last snowy day instead of wearing snow boots. He wore this socks, covered it with another cotton leg warmers around his feet and tried raind boots. His feet was etayed warm for 2 hours and nothing wet. He felt warm enough. Just wish it was little more cheaper and more choice for the one same design between 6 different looks(since we lost kid's socks very often.)"
4.0,"I have no complaints about the quality of this belt. However, I‚Äôve got a size 34 waist and can only put the belt on comfortably in the first notch.<br /><br />I would only buy this if you are truly size 32.  A good choice for those fortunate enough to have a leaner body."
4.0,V neck rather than tunic neckline - so different to that advertised.
4.0,I liked the product was what I expected and it arrived when I expected to arrive.  Perfect on both issues.  Thank you.
4.0,You can't beat these sunglasses for the price. I usually never wear anything like this but I really like how different they are. Get compliments everywhere I go. Plus the bayonet sides are so comfortable. All sunglasses are starting to look the same
4.0,"I will re order these but need to ship back the ones I got, they sizing I think is way off.."
4.0,The chain broke very very easily
4.0,"These are very soft and very sweet. Well made for baby feet with plenty of flexibility, yet a little traction for early walkers. These shoes are very wide on my little one, so if your baby needs that for pudgy feet then these are ideal."
4.0,My daughter almost knocked over the tree when she opened these!!!
4.0,"Wanted tanks a bit higher in the bust for better coverage, these are exactly what I wanted! A bit thinner then I‚Äôd like. Colours are great - I wish there were more colour choices, I would definitely buy again!"
4.0,"I really like this product. Gators are the only types of masks I can work in for hours without having shortness of breath. I also work for an auto manufacturer, so I have some processes that are EXTREMELY hot. These gators keep me from overheating, although, I'm not sure if they are dry fit. More importantly, they have two layers where the insert goes. After the CDC changed the guidelines, my company said we had to comply. The two layers gave me a little bit of a loophole because it was rumored they were going to ban the gators. My only problem, which I recently realized, is that I ordered the Dark Gray, but was sent the Light Gray, I was showing one of my coworkers where to go on Amazon to get her some when I realized the mistake. At this point, I have worn them MANY times, so I didn't bother to do a return."
4.0,Top half fits great but the bottom half is made for someone with huge hips and thighs. Way too long almost touches my knees. I will say the material is nice. Going to see if I can get the lower. Half altered.
4.0,"The purse is not large but I didnt want a large one. The center section has a couple of pockets on the walls and one ""document pocket"" inside.<br />The color is great (purple) and the straps dont slip.<br />My one complaint is that the lining material is noisy. Its goes crackle, crackle, crackle when you use it. I almost returned it because of this but kept it. If it had a less noisy lining, I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,Bought this dress for a semi formal wedding in October. I was a little apprehensive with sizing so I ordered a size up. Wrong!  I should have stayed with normal size. As it was the dress is just a little large in the bust. That almost never happens!  The black will be great dressed up with sparkly jewelry!!!
4.0,"Size did run a bit smaller than expected, but not enough to bother me, i generally like my t-shirts tighter rather than looser. Good quality shirt and design, washes well."
4.0,Colorful and well made
4.0,I bought a large thinking it would be too small and it was big. I could have fit in a medium. It is comfortable though.
4.0,"Haven't used them yet, just did a test run and they seem to work. Planning to wear them for my wedding which will be on the grass."
4.0,"I purchased these for Vegas trip. I read the other reviews and ordered what I thought would be my size (I wear a 10-2 but I got an XXL because they ran small as the other reviews stated). Well, I should've gone with my gut, and just gotten the XL (Which would've fit like an average L). The minute I got in the pool, my swimsuit stretched, and it looked like I was wearing period panties . Im glad they now offer to sell just the bottoms because I just had them replaced,and now I can say I'm in LOVE."
4.0,sleeves too tight for the size of the shirt....other than that I love it
4.0,"When I first saw this purse I thought it was the cutest thing ever.  It is small (11&#34; x 8&#34;) based on what I am used to, but so stylish I wanted to give it a shot.  Until I read the label:  &#34;Humidity may cause permanent wear and tear, avoid getting it wet and avoid direct exposure to direct light and heat.  Avoid contact with oily substances, cosmetics or solvents.  Care should be taken when wearing light coloured garments, and when storing product with different colours, as the colours may transfer onto each other.  Avoid excessive friction and over exposure to direct light as colour fading may occur.&#34;  So when I am supposed to use this purse?  I decided to give it  a test.  First I wiped it with a dry cloth; no color transfer.  Then I wiped the bottom with a damp cloth; no color transfer; then I got really brave and wiped it with an all purpose cleaner; no color came off. Then I wiped it with a kitchen grease cleaner, and no transfer.  I rubbed both purses all over my bathrobe and they still looked good.  So now I figure I am safe  The purse is very pretty, so I'm going to use it tomorrow at church and then shopping with a friend and see what happens.  The warning label is scary, but I think I exposed it to some fairly harsh treatment and it held up well.  Maybe the label is just for their protection, but it made me uneasy.  At the end of the day, it is a very nice, small (to me, I usually wear huge purses), simple but elegant and does not look cheap.  My other purses are Coach, Brahman, Michael Kors and this purse looks great, let's just see how it holds up.  I'm thinking it will, after what I just did to it. So I think it's a safe bet these colors won't transfer, but I will have to wait and see."
4.0,The product first well but I have a problem connecting the hook at the top of it.
4.0,"My little girl likes the dress. She was the one who picked it among all others. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the fabric is polyester which I don't like. Also, it's a bit on a short side. I ordered size 4 ( my daughter is 3) and it is the way above her knees. Other than that, it is a nice dress, especially for the price."
4.0,"Love the board, strong and very presentable wood, wish it was a tad larger."
4.0,"Good, quality, fiberglass mask. It is a little wide, so if you have a narrow or short face, it will not fit you well.<br />The straps are well fitted with an excellent system and a padded plate at the back.<br />Two minor issues to be aware of:<br />It touches my nose in front, depending on how it is put on<br />The padding is glued in and when it will be a pain to clean and replace when it is necessary."
4.0,Very nice ! Dresses up the simplest outfit ! Nice quality !!
4.0,"Actual size is quite small. If you‚Äôre looking for a smaller, more delicate earring, these would be good for you. I have somewhat short hair and they can barely be seen on me."
4.0,"It is not as structured as it looks. If you have items in the main compartment, getting my shoes in and out of the shoe compartment becomes difficult. However, I do enjoy the amount of space and the convenient pockets of the bag especially considering how small and portable the bag is."
4.0,The colors are great; goes with several solid colored blouses.  It's lightweight so good for TX weather.  The one change that would have made it 5 stars is if the sleeves were cuffed.
4.0,I‚Äôm not sure why it took me this many years to find something for a plus size shorts that were past the knee.  I‚Äôm very happy with this product. I have no yet used them in water but I will this weekend at our hotel.  I‚Äôm very self conscious about the back of my knees and  I hate that I normally can‚Äôt find a pair of swimming trunks to cover them.  Usually I‚Äôd purchase a men‚Äôs pink trunks.  But I wanna look girly.  Very happy with these.
4.0,"These glasses are great. The frames are durable and strong as I have accidentally dropped at least each pair once and they haven't suffered frame stress and cracked apart. The screws are a slight problem as I have found I have had to re-tighten them numerous times but what pair of sunglasses doesn't have this problem?<br />Alongside the top of my set though I had a strange realization that the glasses seem to have a sort of plastic deformation that is nearly identical across all 3 pairs so I don't know if it was a malfunctioning error that lead to this or not but it overall did not impact the glasses.<br />The lenses are sturdy and resistant to polishing and cleaning so they don't lose their mirror finish. However thought, the actual color all 3 sets had was blue, which was strange as I expected it to match up to some form of orange, purple and green as that was the set I had received. This is however an aesthetic grievance and overall I was not too disappointed with them considering the price and availability.<br />I have recommended these glasses to others and received a few compliments for how they reflect light.<br />Overall, very satisfied aside cosmetic issues."
4.0,"This dress is adorable but add 1 or 2 sizes up. Otherwise, I love this dress."
4.0,To big for my small hands
4.0,bought this zip up for my husband  fits good and he likes it win win :)
4.0,My daughter needed these for a hip-hop dance concert. She wears them all the time. So comfortable!
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable dress. I ordered the XL, which it fit fine for me.  It‚Äôs what I usually wear. However,  being a bit larger in the bust area, the dress did not have good coverage there for me. I kept hiking it up to cover the bra showing. Other than that I really like it. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and on the slightly large size and this was pretty much true to size. The hem came to just above the knee.  The material is stretchy, light and flowy. Cute with a pair of red Chuckies."
4.0,small but plenty room for storage...Would be better if it could stand on its own.
4.0,IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT I HAVE USED FOR A LONG TIME AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION ARE DURABLE AND GOOD ...
4.0,"I really like it, but the fabric is thin, but i am going to reorder it. The color was beautiful. It also runs on the small side.  So order a larger size."
4.0,"The glasses are nice but they did pinch the ears a alot, maybe because he has a bigger size head.  Other than the ear pinching they are some nice glasses and protect your eyes from the sun."
4.0,Its good but u guys need to improve your speakers
4.0,I just recently received this item and I like it very much. Plan to give as a gift. I do have a question about the product. I received the ear rings and the piece for the necklace but no chain. Was it to come with a chain is my only question.
4.0,An excellent price on bicycle shorts. Very light and comfortable if there loose. Has padding where it's needed. I wear a 2x but ordered the 4x and am glad I did. These shorts come very small. Order at least 2 sizes bigger.
4.0,"Love it. Very pretty on. Waist band is tight and flipped down on occasion.  I'm not as skinny as the model.  I wish it would've been longer, but really pretty. May order another color"
4.0,Cute blouse but when I lift my arms the whole blouse pulls up and my midriff gets exposed. I still wear it tucked into high-waisted pants.
4.0,Do not loose it's color
4.0,Nice looking visor. The only thing is the buckle that allows you to adjust the size I fear will break if you put in  the washing machine. It is very cheap.
4.0,Comgottsble
4.0,I just got this in black today. I was expecting a scrunchie shirt but it is more like a short dress. Regardless I love it! Perfect for the transition from summer into fall. Light weight and breezy yet log sleeved. Will look great with leggings! As for the size follow the size chart listed and if you are in between sizes order the smaller size.
4.0,beautiful for little girls!
4.0,"When I first got the watch I was pretty disappointed. The strap is stiff, too thick, and overly long. This ensures that it will always slide around on your wrist. I didn't wear it for months after I bought it. Eventually I bought an inexpensive black leather strap for 12 bucks and now its a great watch. One small gripe I have is that the glass they use for the crystal scratches easily, I wish they would use hard mineral or sapphire. I also wish the case was a little smaller, 37mm would be perfect.<br />Overall its a decent watch and one of the cheapest second hand sweeping quartz time pieces on the market."
4.0,This dress runs a bit large I wish I would have ordered it in a size down but I made it work for me with a cute belt around it. The dress is very comfortable and I want to order all the colors!
4.0,"love this bra, but I felt like it fits a little small.  I'm a 34B and bought a small, I wish I would have bought a Medium."
4.0,"I ordered the larger size because the lenses were bigger and would have worked better with my glasses, but they were too big overall and would not stay put, so I returned them and ordered the smaller size.  These seem to be good quality, and I really wish they had fit."
4.0,"It's beautiful but impossibly long! I'm 5'5&#34;, 130 lbs, but a medium was 8 inches too long."
4.0,It was a little snug when it was supposed to be a 3XXX.  Looks like I need to take off a few pounds.
4.0,"This design is compact due to the thin water-repelling fabric, so it‚Äôs easy to keep in your car. It covers most of your body, which is great if you get caught in the rain, plus it has two reflective bands to help with visibility, though their small size and strange placement make them only somewhat useful. (If you‚Äôre trying to fix a tire or do something with your arms, they will likely block the strips. It would have made more sense in the center back and upper front areas."
4.0,"I do like this bag, but just wish it was just a little bigger.  If you have a small laptop, def recommend this bag. Super cute!"
4.0,"Chain's too short. Had to buy a new and longer one. Otherwise, I love how it looks! Makes my outfit look more fun and less boring."
4.0,i really love this shirt  it fits well i ordered a size up im glad i did its a little smaller at the top then the bottom ..i4 stars because i wish the sleeve was a little longer..other then  fits well i love it..i want another color..lol
4.0,A little small but work on adults and children.
4.0,Good band at a good price for the Pebble Steel. It was a little short for me but it worked.
4.0,Updated review: comfy but only good to sleep in. Largest party lines ever.
4.0,These gloves are nice. They fit good are warm and I can use my phone wearing them.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful. Bought for my bridesmaids. Very elegant.
4.0,"I really like it, just wish it was a little larger"
4.0,"Love this watch! Super cute, comfy on my wrist-and I have kinda small wrists. Very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Fits great and is very cute. The belt is held in place with two side loops which I love since her she plays hard and things always come untied. The fabric is lightweight and good for hot weather. It is a bit see through so I would recommend shorts underneath it or a slip.
4.0,"This is a solid product, well-made with good access.  The only complaint is that it does not dry quickly after washing."
4.0,"Got these to be worn for a group that has been nicknamed &#34;the fire brigade&#34;.  They are flimsy, but at least they fit an average adult."
4.0,This is nice.  Quality material and craftsmanship.  Thank you.
4.0,Great shoe. Good quality and fits true to size.
4.0,These gloves are nice and warm. My only issue is fitting them into my jacket pockets. Otherwise I'm happy with this purchase.
4.0,"price was good, but zipper keeps coming apart"
4.0,"The top is a keeper. The V neck is a bit low for my modest taste, but the suit is cute on. That being said, I didn't like the shorts... The are low waste and very short. They also felt too snug.<br />For the cost, I'll wear the top and purchase different shorts."
4.0,Very pretty color and affordable price.  Great value and quality for the money spent.
4.0,"4 stars for design, but not enough compression."
4.0,This thing will make the sweat pour off you.  Wear a t shirt under.<br />I did not like the size of the pants or the cuffs..... but I can live with it for the result.<br />Turn it inside out and gentle cycle wash air dry (very low heat) and good to go.
4.0,The outside is soft but the inside is scratchy<br />Fits well and the sleeves went down to my wrist and not a inch more. It fits perfectly.<br />The material felt very soft on the outside but was scratchy on the inside. The buttons are huge and are loose so I recommend resewing them once you get it.
4.0,My grandson is into Five Nights At Freddy's and loves this hat. My only issue is that the left eye only lights up whenever it feels like it
4.0,Will use them anyways. But bummed how dirty they were
4.0,"Great braided keychain. A little longer than I'd personally like, but it does match the description. So far, the quality seems great. I would buy again. Reasonable value for money spent."
4.0,"This is super cute and fits well but the material looks and feels cheap. I wouldn't expect much more from such an affordable dress, but the kind of shiny material reminds me more of a costume than a piece of clothing that can stand up to everyday wear. I've worn and washed it a few times and there are a couple of spots where something caught the fabric and it shows. Still, not bad for the price!"
4.0,IT WAS A SMALL FITTING 1X It was fitting let a meduim I do not have a chest at all.  I wear a 1x.  the quality was good
4.0,Love the feel.  Used the sizes they said and are kinda big on me.  I'm a 10 1/2 should have ordered small.
4.0,It's comfortable and feminine
4.0,I normally wear 8 1/2 and thanks to reviews I didn't buy 9 I bought 8 and fits perfect . I was worried 8 would be snug but it's not it's perfect
4.0,"The dress is amazing, I have it in blue and black! I'm having to return the black because the neck tie broke while I was out and it left me exposed! But I rigged it with knots to get through the night.. And I got so many compliments!! It's a head turner!!"
4.0,Sexy on my woman but tight
4.0,On time and quality product. Don't like that you cannot make a purchase as a guest anymore. Too time consuming and intrusive.
4.0,"It's good to use less leather and this belt is a good alternative. It's nylong, but doesn't look like it, appears tightly woven.  It's convenient to have ethe three vp;ptd--black, gray and beige. The buckle is flat and a bit shiny, just like the picture.  The buckle was initially difficult to figure out. (After it's on and you understand how it works, it's very easy to adjust, better than leather with holes.) You can completely release the non-buckling side, which is confusing. (It will anchor when you stick it back in--and holds).  The end that goes into the buckle slides in and automatically locks in place.  But...when you want to adjust it, it is hard to figure out.  Eventually we realized the little lever on the side of the buckle releases the belt so it can move.  But you have to pull it upward, toward the sky, not push it in or down.  After figuring that out, it was a good, belt."
4.0,"After purchasing 2-3 mask packs online, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt recommend purchasing some online. I purchased these for my brother and I after reading the reviews. They don't fit as well as I‚Äôd like them to. The elastics aren‚Äôt very helpful. The mask keeps slipping if you talk with it on. Material is nice tho"
4.0,Cute &#34;over top&#34;. Appears to be as advertised....fits....not worn yet.
4.0,It looked great and was comfortable
4.0,Adorable.  Definitely exceeded the quality I expected for the price. I think I'll order some of the other colors of this one.  Super comfy and always getting compliments
4.0,"The white is thin &  a little  bit sheer.  But the black is rich & opaque.  These are good as sleep tops for very very light support.  If your really big breasted,  these are not usable without a bra."
4.0,It came with a tiny hole in it so I exchanged it and that went smooth. I like the top
4.0,easy on off for around the house. will order again
4.0,"Must admit, these slippers are not the most attractive shoes on the planet, but they're fairly comfortable and get the job done."
4.0,this is a good product lasted me all of middle school!
4.0,"The pin looked and felt of quality. Used it on my bag, but then one day it fell off and lost it. Enjoyed it while I had it."
4.0,"The Revo sunglasses do the job. They are nice and look very good. The inner frame is great for people line me who need glasses due to myopia. The only problem is that you have to be careful not to drop then, because the frame will surely break (it happened already). I had to buy a new one to replace the broken one. It‚Äôs still much cheaper than buying brand sunglasses that cost at least $200."
4.0,5'7 150lbs. Runs a little small. But it works. Love the material.
4.0,"I love the bag but, was suppose to be gray and is more brown.  Love it though, especially for price."
4.0,"Very pretty, love the different sizes. Not the best quality. Gems falling out and stems breaking off. Would recommend as long as people are aware they may not last very long."
4.0,Good for the casual use.  Reportedly comfortable to wear.
4.0,this is a gift for my girlfriend. it fit here correctly to her frame.
4.0,Love the look and style of the belt and buckle.  My husband is ill and has lost a tremendous amount of weight so this belt will shrink and grow with him.  The release clasp is a little hard for him to undo but he is getting better at it. Thank you.
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, 148lbs, athletic build, 34D and wear a size 6. I purchased a medium. The front gaps open a tiny bit but I'm not worried about anything spilling out. I opt for pasties with this one as a bra would not work well."
4.0,Beautiful product. Online photos give good representation. Well made. Love the interior colors. Very beachy. Clasp magnet is a little weak but functional. Would definitely buy again or recommend.
4.0,"This is the 2nd pair I've ordered for by husband.  He puts them on as soon as he gets home and wears them all the time inside and outside the house.  He loves the comfort, but when I told him price he wasn't too happy.  He wore the others out in the lining, so this time I purchased some clear heel liners to help with that."
4.0,The scrubs fit good but the white coat was big. Easy to wash and didn‚Äôt fall apart.
4.0,The material is nice and it fits perfectly
4.0,"I purchased an xl. The fit is more so light a large. If available, I would purchase a size up moving forward."
4.0,These are really cute and in style and definitely worth it for the price but whenever they arrived one had a scuff mark on it and they‚Äôre very stiff it‚Äôs hard to walk down stairs in them without creasing them.
4.0,"ITs a beautiful dress, just a darker color than expected. Also the volume isn‚Äôt the same as the picture."
4.0,These are well made. The only issue I have it‚Äôs that my wrists are so tiny these don‚Äôt want to stay cinched down small enough to not slide around
4.0,Love the lenses. Theyre jus kinda big. Great for driving at dusk/dawn.
4.0,"I return dress as it was too big. I am 5\4 and weigh 164. I ordered a medium and it was perfect. If u are big busted be careful of the top. As far as the bottom it flares so it fits s, m, l."
4.0,"Great boots, they were just a little snug for a 9. My son usually wears an 8 but we wanted room for socks and growth. We had a hard time getting them on & he did wear them for a few hours."
4.0,Very soft and fit well.  The insides seem to be shreading/falling apart already so I am not sure how long they will last.
4.0,"Largest stone a little dull or cloudy, but still sparkle, tiny eye stone really sparkle. Twenty inch necklace including extension.  Took 33 days to come. Worth price and wait."
4.0,"It‚Äôs not the best quality, but its cute and fits alright. The material is thicker and super soft on the inside. It‚Äôs for sure short AF, so leggings or tights are needed. It‚Äôs a bit tight on my stomach, but that‚Äôs my issue, not the dress :)"
4.0,Not as bright as in the image but still very pretty! My roommate loved them.
4.0,"Just got this shirt yesterday and I love it!! I got a medium and it fits comfortably..the only thing is that the sleeves seem a little tight, but the material and overall fit is great!"
4.0,The cuffs were a bit tight but the shirt fit great.
4.0,Nice every day watch.
4.0,"Ok. I‚Äôm pretty small (XS) and I usually order smaller items online because in my experience, things online are actually bigger than when I buy in the store. But, these are true to size. They still fit but I‚Äôd probably have gotten a S if I‚Äôd tried them in in store."
4.0,"Just a tad thinner than I wanted, but they work as casual T's."
4.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these leggings. Seriously. I don't know how I didn't find them sooner. I have them in blue also. This particular pair was slightly looser around the waist which leaves a lot of pulling up and adjusting (hence the 4 stars), but otherwise they're fantastic. I've not got 4 pairs in both long and Capri :)"
4.0,"Cute shirt. It does run a bit large and long. Also, the material is fairly thin. Looks best with a layering shirt under it."
4.0,"Quality is great, but I ordered a 12 for my son-in-law as 11 1/2 was not available.  They are too large and have to send them back"
4.0,Very small but cute.I had them for my 50th birthday party.
4.0,"I bought this dress for a cruise and it‚Äôs super cute but it‚Äôs way too long. I‚Äôm 5,4 and as you can see by the picture there is a bunch of fabric gathered on the ground."
4.0,A good everyday brand of hosiery. They look and feel great.
4.0,"Nice earrings but hard to put on.  They are tight and I probably won't be able to wear them long periods of time but for an hour or two, they will work for me."
4.0,I've had great sunglasses and I've had crappy sunglasses I would write these glasses on a scale of four out of five you sure do get your money's worth with these and I wouldn't mind wearing them to any event.
4.0,"Cute little fan, works well for the purpose I got it, which was to have a fan for a Las Vegas showgirl costume. The feathers come out easily, but I was expecting that with any feather product."
4.0,I was looking for a very small pair of white gold black studs and these fit what I wanted perfectly. I use them for my cartilage but they would probably be a good size for a second hole also.
4.0,I like the shirt . I wear it when I go to the gym but it is  a little flimsy otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,Shirt fits well. Nothing else to say.
4.0,Works great for my ID Badge and keys for work.  I‚Äôm constantly opening between 20 to 40 gates at a time and this helps a lot by not having to reach in my pocket every time.
4.0,"It's not that long, how it seems in the picture.  I'm 5'3 and it fits little higher.<br />Fabric awesome!<br />Good Delivery time"
4.0,"I got this to wear around the house during pregnancy. It lasted about a month and a half before it got a huge rip in the back, not even on a seam where I could have fixed it. I did order it again because it looked nice, covered my big belly and my booty, and with just a month to go this pregnancy, it‚Äôs the cheapest comfiest shirt in this style. I didn‚Äôt shrink in the wash either."
4.0,But it does look great.
4.0,Cute fairly small wrist about a 7 I think.  Leather a little thick and somewhat stiff.
4.0,"This is a nice quality item with no loose stiches and seams are well made. The material for white is 75% cotton and 25% nylon. It is not heavy nor is it see through at all and if falls nicely.  I am normally a size 6 but trending closer to an 8 with a little pudge after COVID so I have been looking for looser fitting, flowy top to hide the belly. I'm 5'3"", 141lbs for reference. The medium fits a bit looser than necessary but it still works so I will keep it. It may shrink a little after washing although I always wash items like this on delicate and hang to dry so we'll see. After washing, I'll decide whether or not to purchase a small or another medium in another color!"
4.0,Material is very nice. Fits well. Great dress. Not the best quality
4.0,"Sun protection while kitesurfing. Durable enough to take the abuse. Fit is exactly as advertised. 5'10"" 175. Athletic. Good color/graphical match to pics. As advertised."
4.0,"Decent but paper thin material.  Does stretch nicely to stay on.  Plain black.  Good enough for me, but definitely the thinnest I have seen."
4.0,"Too cute to refuse, and at a great price!"
4.0,I was wearing the watch and it just fell off my wrist. But I put it back together and have had no problem since.
4.0,"We did not realize that the shoes would have a squeaky thing in their soles, so it took us by surprise. It is way too loud for the shoes to be used even for just 15min in a row. However the shoes are really nice. So we put some nail polish on the air exit outside the sole, and the shoes don't squeak anymore."
4.0,This was a beautifully made bathing suit( as it should be for the price!) but it just didn't fit me and had to be returned. The pattern is slimming and the Miracle suits do hug you tight in all of the necessary places..
4.0,The yellow is more green but other than that exactly like the picture
4.0,"My husband really likes these socks. He has pretty much reduced his sock wardrobe down to whatever variations of these he can get his hands on. They're pricey, but to him, they're worth it. The compression feels great to him because of his diabetic nerualgia. The pressure provides a little bit of relief, to the point that he wears them to bed even. I don't know that the copper in any truth has anything to do with this, other than perhaps a gimmick, who knows. But I do know, is that he likes them, he can wear them with his dress shoes and no one really knows them apart from any other dress socks and they've held up fairly well in the washing machine without loosing any of their elasticity. I'll keep buying them."
4.0,Fit as expected ?
4.0,The part that snaps is a little long. The material is soft and comfy for baby.
4.0,"These are great for tables.  The only issue is if the table is too thick, it doesn't work."
4.0,Yeah Disney bound Alice.
4.0,"These glasses did not fit me well, and I will be returning them. However I believe they are good quality.<br /><br />I recently bought UV and Blue Light meters by Tenmars and Solarmeter, respectively, to test light sources in my house and decided to test my new glasses purchases too. Be advised that these glasses are each for slightly different applications and my results here compare only their light emission quality, which was my primary interest in buying them.<br /><br />These were tested using a CFL at 6&#34;. UV is in uW/cm2 measured with Tenmars TM-213 UV-AB meter. Blue/HEV light is in uW/cm2 measured with Solarmeter Model 9.2, 422-499mm wavelength. Here is what I found out:<br /><br />The HD Vision X-Loop driving glasses UV reading went from 9 to 0.5, the BL reading from 82 to 13.<br />The Uvex S3200X safety glasses  went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 72.<br />The AV AirLunette computer glasses went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 53.<br />The J+S Active Plus athelete glasses went from 9 to 5, and 82 to 70.<br />Old uncoated clear plastic safety goggles went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 72.<br />The Gateway gas welding goggles went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 0.<br />The Jackson saftey goggles went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 73.<br />No Tears Onion Goggles went from 9 to 3, and 82 to 66.<br />Smith & Wesson safety glasses  went from 9 to 0, and 82 to 40.<br /><br />This leads me to conclude that what I had read on the subject of UV light was correct: UV light doesn't penetrate plastic well. The fact that some of these modern glasses performed worse than the old uncoated goggles makes me conclude that the thickness and matrix of plastic lenses is more significant than any coating that may be advertised. For glass lenses of course the coating is 100% responsible for UV protection. In either case, tint color is irrelevant.<br /><br />But tint color and darkness does seem to correlate with Blue/HEV light protection. The HD Vision were the darkest by far and out-performed everything but the welding goggles, which were obviously darker still. Surprisingly the S&W glasses did well despite being nearly clear - better than the AV computer glasses."
4.0,"I was worried the belt wouldnt fit since I didnt measure myself.  Ordered the XL and it actually will fit great.  Unfortunately the belt arrived really bent where the ""hook"" is (see pictures).  Hoping hubby can bend it back in the right position and it doesnt look bad because of how it was bent.  Event is thos weekend, will update.  I may have to return for a refund.<br /><br />Other than that I do love the belt."
4.0,"The nurses said ""That works"" so I guess it works."
4.0,I bought this to complete a costume- it fits great. Has quite a bit of stretch to it so it would work well with all shapes & sizes.
4.0,Dress fit me perfectly. Got lots of compliments at my office party.
4.0,"This case is cute and gets the job done. The inside shell isn't fitted well and it is coming unglued. Not a big deal as it can be reglued. For the price of you just want a basic eyeglass case that is cuter than average, this is it!"
4.0,"Strap went on fine (I had the proper tool to adjust the clasp and used the pins from my old band). Looks nice, feels sturdy. It's a bit less flexible than I'd like, but maybe that will happen with time."
4.0,"Great material and does hold after many washes so its a good product, but it does run a little big."
4.0,"Very cute, can be changed to be large or small. It did break on me, but it was fixable. Still wearing it. üëçüèº"
4.0,A very sweet butterfly pendant necklace.  Nice quality.
4.0,I bought the white and I just didn‚Äôt like how the print looked in person. The dress actually felt and looked good but the colors weren‚Äôt good on me. I may order again in black.
4.0,Fits nice with comfortable design.
4.0,I saw this on tiktok but was skeptical because I'm plus size & I breastfed so I don't have the perkiest DDD's lol. I tried it on and didn't love the fit..not alot of lift and lots of spillage on the sides BUT I then tried it on with the crisscross in the back and I am OBSESSED. Got compliments all night!!!
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, and a lot lighter in weight than I thought it would be. I'm 155 lbs @ 5'3"", measuring 36D-34-43, and I bought a Large. It fits true to size, except theres a little bit of extra room in the bust that sticks out near the armpits. Other than that I found the dress to be flattering, the dark green to be dark indeed, and just the right length. I could slip it over my head without unzipping it, though I did have to carefully wiggle it over my breasts. The dress had static cling out of the package, but that could be fixed. The belt/sash is not attached, but there are belt loops. I do not have the belt through the loops in the pictures. Overall a cute dress except for the wide breast area."
4.0,"It was a bit bigger but i still liked it, made me look like i lost weight...lol"
4.0,"These masks are so cute, and I get compliments on them everywhere I go. I've had them for a few months, and after the first few weeks I did notice I was losing a few sequins around the nose area of the masks. It's not a big deal, but it is something to be aware of, especially when washing the masks.<br />They are super comfortable though. The inner lining covers enough so the sequins don't poke me in the face, which is great. Overall, these are good masks at a really good price."
4.0,"This sweater dress is cute.  It is thinner material than I was expecting, so it's a little more clingy.  It does show a panty line, and any lumps or bulges, so you might need a slip or something underneath.  It took me a little while to figure out the best way to tie the wrap so that I'm not at risk of flashing people.  I love the color and the style!"
4.0,"Love it, but the strap could be more durable."
4.0,They seem more like water shoes than anything else. But great for those sudden bursts of energy throughout the day. Slips and falls are certainly avoided.
4.0,"I love the look and comfort.  Plus they are so lightweight, I don‚Äôt get indentations on the bridge of my nose.  I love that!! They are not quite as strong as my previous glasses though. I ordered 1.75 ( normal for me ), and they‚Äôre a little too weak.  Next time I‚Äôll order up.."
4.0,I love how it flows so naturally and I get compliments a lot. But it‚Äôs on the smaller side and I would have ordered one size bigger if I had known.
4.0,"The sizing is accurate and I really love how this pair fits. Probably one of the best pairs I've bought on Amazon. It feels really soft and comfortable. The pockets are pretty deep, having zippers on them is an added bonus. If you don't want it as a slim fit, getting a size up should suffice. I also really like the way its tapered so that its tighter around the calf. The package came in on time in good condition.<br /><br />Updating after 3rd purchase:<br />Okay the first and second time I bought these the lengths were consistent with the measurements listed, but my 3rd one seems to be waaay longer :I I'm really short (4 foot 9 :c) so the difference is pretty bad with the 3rd pair I bought. The waist size was the same and accurate (bought a size 30) but the length was different (its 39in instead of 36in) . What I noticed though was the material is a bit different and the tag is different, I'm assuming they made some changes including the lengths but didn't edit them in their product description."
4.0,These crop top tanks do not have a built in bra. They are made of an elastic type material that makes for a fitted look. They are very soft and comfortable. They are perfect alone or layered.
4.0,I believe my only complaint is that the compression shirt isn't very long and if wearing underclothes it does have a tendency to ride up. For the price though its something im willing to overlook
4.0,"This dress is a little big, but it's really cute!"
4.0,"I really, really love this dress! Its a wee bit tight in the bust, however the top does have plenty of stretch. I probably could have sized up, however then it might have been too large for me. I wish the waist was elastic to eliminate the side zipper, but it doesn't bother me too much. The skirt is light and a bit flowy for me, and I love the pockets! I highly recommend this dress for work, casual dress, or a night out! The print is great and crisp, this is probably my new favorite dress!<br />For size reference I ordered an X-Large, I'm 5'4&#34; 40D about 190lbs"
4.0,"So comfortable! Good for sleeping and working out, not as much for going out. Thumbs up!"
4.0,"Really pretty dress.  Shipping SO fast which helped for our wedding since we had to cancel our 2018 wedding and push it up to October this year.  Sequins are beautiful, shines and secure.  Dress looks like picture and is great champagne color.  First dress we bought didn't fit (was too large) but we did not measure.  Measurements taken it fits like a charm."
4.0,Got these as groomsmen gifts. They all loved them.
4.0,I would give this a 5 if you could order it at least in 2 sizes like small/med and large/XL. I really like this and it is nicely made but I wear a size 0-2 in womans jeans and it's a little big on me. I wish it was just a little smaller. If you are avarage size it should be great for you!
4.0,"The color in the picture is beautiful - this magenta-red ""wine"" color, but in real life the scarf is much more basic crayon-red. Nevertheless, it's soft, a great price, and I would say overall a good buy. However, just be aware that the color is vastly different from what is pictured."
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of slippers to wear at the hospital with my second pregnancy. I had a pair of Jane Bleeckers that looked the same style as these (different colors though) and they were such a blessing with my first. This manufacturer doesn‚Äôt do half sizes but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. I ordered the 7-8 (medium) and they fit like an 8.5 PERFECTLY. They are so comfortable!! Very fluffy inside but idk how durable they will be because the material is a bit thinner than my Jane bleeckers, perfect for my hospital bag with baby number 2 though because of the little ‚Äúbaby on board‚Äù on the bottom! For $13 and lasting for photos/cuddling they‚Äôre great. For longevity/durability, I would look for another pair of Jane Bleecker slipper socks with a bow."
4.0,Perfect fit for what I needed ..  strong strap and easily adjustable
4.0,These are great. I though it would more fake or cheesy looking but to my pleasant surprise bout them for my son he actually wants to purchase some more....good buy as I was going for a funny make u laugh gift but pleasantly surprised as before
4.0,A great gift item or to keep for your self.  Easy to read and a smart look
4.0,"These were perfect for my outfits. The yarn is comfortable and the front panels were the right size to fit my thin calves. They stayed up nice, only had to readjust once or twice due to the yarn stretching. Only downside is they start to look a bit frayed after the second use. For the price I would buy again. I also bought them in black was able to wear them at least 5 times; also went swimming in them twice. If you don‚Äôt like shoes or want to commit to a heavy sandal, these are perfect. Festival, beach and boat approved."
4.0,"The color matches the rose gold watch great, the rubber does get dirty very quickly though and will not clean. My wrist rubs on the counter alot and its stained. I still wear it everyday just something to be aware of."
4.0,I usually order a small but I got a medium and they still seem like a smaller size. So definitely size up on this product. Its a good quality for the price though.
4.0,I really love these leggings so my black ones fit perfect no sliding no nothing the other 2 I have to keep pulling them up if I went up a size they would be to be and down a size they would be to small! I love the feel of them and that they are not see through at all I have and Will order more the pockets are life
4.0,Small but eady to alter! Great look!
4.0,These beanies fits true to size very comfortable but stretches out of shape to easily. Nice to wear with your FedX uniform though.  Will buy again!
4.0,It's hard to find a tie-dye dashiki so I'm happy I bought it for my husband but it's turned into his favorite and it's so thin. We've had it for a year now and it's got 3 holes. Worth the buy if you can take care of it
4.0,Seem like a well made liner but at least one size too small.  If you wear a 10 order a 12.
4.0,The bra I ordered fits because I ordered the size they recommended. The only issue is the bra squeaks when it moves. Hopefully that improves after washing
4.0,"Nice hat, just a little bulky on top though."
4.0,"This fabric is a little stiff, but I‚Äôm sure it will soften with time."
4.0,Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is they strink up a lot when washed
4.0,"These are super soft and stretchy. They run on the large size. I bought these because I work outside for part of the day. These are more functional, less fashionable."
4.0,The belly button rings were exactly as pictured and very pretty but one has already broke. I am not surprised though because of the price. Would buy again!
4.0,"The earrings are absolutely stunning and of nice quality. However, the piece that goes into the ear is too thick for me. I put them in and had to takes them out after a few minutes because my ears were hurting and turned red and hot."
4.0,Fits so well and love it
4.0,"Bought mostly for carrying toys so the sand could fall out, rinse them in the bag, and drain. See like it will work well. Little smaller than expected but still a good size. Not sure what the little scarf this is for. Supposedly some kind of towel. Not sure for what though."
4.0,Great product but too small for the piercing I needed it for
4.0,"I normally wear a 7 womens shoe and a 4 1/2 boys shoe. I ordered the 4 1/2, but on this shoe I could have used a size 5 boys, just to fit perfect.  I did return them, because the heel part inside the shoe felt hard, and was hurting my foot. I think if I was younger it would have been just wearable, but Im a senior , so needed some cushioning.  The seller was very easy to deal with, and I thought the shoes were really cute"
4.0,Very pretty! Got multiple compliments on it!
4.0,Fun but dont expect any support. I get a lot of compliments when i wear it
4.0,"For the money this cute little classic sundress is attractive, perfect and just what I needed and the choice of skirt patterns is almost unlimited.<br />I'm 5'3&#34; and 156 and am very glad I ordered the XL since the top is not as stretchy as I thought (maybe a good thing). I have not washed it yet so am hoping the skirt does not come out crumpled enough to require ironing! I would absolutely order this dress again"
4.0,These pants look and feel great but they are way smaller than the tag. I purchased the US size 29 (Tag size 30) but the waist was actually 27. Plan to switch out for a larger size. Good quality though.
4.0,The product was like it was described.  I wear a size 8 and I had plenty of room.
4.0,"We got the fire and bones, my son loves them! They're thick and the design is just what we needed for playing on playgrounds in the winter."
4.0,"Lovely watch does what you expect, chain could be longer though and the clip was more adjustable"
4.0,Did not realize that these needed to be hand washed and laid flat to dry when I bought them
4.0,This is a great casual pull-on dress and you will really enjoy the comfortable fit. It fits a little loose but may shrink during laudering over time.
4.0,"Very nice dress and comfortable, longer than expected, have to spend money to fix hem.  Overall is a pretty for the price."
4.0,"The costume itself is beautiful!  Unfortunately, I ordered a M/L based on their sizing chart and it was too small.  I'm sending it back and getting a L/XL instead.  Hoping this time won't be too big as I'm extremely excited about this costume!  Will update once I get the bigger size in...<br /><br />The bigger size fit much better and looked great.  I am a bit top-heavy so I may try to attach some clear straps to hold things in a bit better in the future.  Customer service was awesome and they did free expedited shipping so I got the replacement in 2 days."
4.0,"I bought this for my wife, she loved it. Fit as expected felt nice looked great. Down side, the zipper is really hard to move up and down. The dress did come with a snag in the fabric but other than that is was perfect. I would recommend it."
4.0,I got this hat for my daughters 7th birthday. She is in love with JOJO right now and stores don't have much. I ordered this for her birthday and she instantly wanted to wear it. It fits nicely but wish it would fit better. I think that it is more between a toddler and little girl fit.
4.0,It was a little larger than what I'd have wanted it to be. But it looks great and is soft.
4.0,It is hard to find + prescriptions without paying $200+. My kids love these. They say they can see when they walk around and across the pool/lake much better than with traditional goggles. My only complaint is that they are not very durable. After a few weeks of daily wear the gasket comes off. I can get it back on but it leaks. I have bought several pairs with similar results. For the price point I guess I shouldn't expect much more. This isn't a children specific product.
4.0,Great touch to my halloween costume! Large lens were perfit size.
4.0,Great hat. So stylish that someone stole it and now I must order another!
4.0,Ordered this for my 14yr old daughter. She loves it.
4.0,not bad but fit alittle small
4.0,"Nice for work, good weight and great length."
4.0,Bought this pendant for my son.  Don't care for the string bit and replaced it with a thicker one.  It does rub off on light colored clothing a bit. Not sure if it should do that or not.
4.0,Good Good
4.0,Got these for an 80s Halloween costume.  They were fine
4.0,Love this but the elastic around the hole in the top stretched out after a short time.
4.0,I would have liked a higher waisted jean but was not available. They fit very well and are certainly comfortable.
4.0,The sizing was fine. It fits my baby well. The quality was a bit on the low end. The material was a bit thin compared to other Carters onesies I've bought before.
4.0,Good look good fit
4.0,"I wear a 7 1/2 normally which is what I ordered and they fit great.  A little tight in the heel at first, but they stretch out fine.  I have a narrow foot.  I could see if someone has a fat foot they would be too tight.<br />I ordered black, the photo of the boot is black, the box says black and yet they are a dark green/gray color with black splotches.  I think I was sent the incorrect color, so still trying to decide if I am keeping them or sending back for actual black black.  The sole is nice and sturdy and will be good for walking."
4.0,"This glasses are good for the price, the only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they don't get  dark like it says on the description, they do get a little darker, but sun still very strong though it."
4.0,"This is a great blouse for work! The only downside is if you're under 5'4 and are smaller in size, even a small will still be a bit baggy on me. For reference, I am 5'4 and 130 lbs."
4.0,Hard to get the gloves to stay unless the Velcro is at the very end. This leaves a lot that can scratch baby and or get stuck on something and pull them off. Materials are great though. He can still grab things through them and play. So we still love them.
4.0,We will enjoy these when we travel...it will be nice to have everything you need in one case and the size is not huge.
4.0,"Nicely crafted and good looking shoe.  The size was wrong (ad said 4 to 4 1/2 and they were really a 4...my baby wears a 4 1/2 so I had to return them...they were too short. Returning them was no problem thanks to Amazon's excellent service.)  The shoes were too stiff ,anyway,for my toddling one year-old who is still perfecting her walking. If just for appearance,or for a baby who can't walk yet, they do look good however."
4.0,The fastest shipping I've ever seen and it was exactly as advertised!
4.0,"I really like wearing the 90 Degree brand of Capri. I wear them a lot for my cardio workout classes. They are very comfortable and I love the length, some other brands are too short for my 5'6&#34; frame. I bought a size in large which fits perfectly for me (5'6&#34;, 142 lbs. in my 60's, Florida heat)."
4.0,"Good color, fit, and material. I ended up returning it because I didn't need it."
4.0,"This is a nice shawl, it's got thick, quality material. I wish it were a bit larger. I absolutely love the hood, and the fringe is a cute touch. The fabric has a knitted texture.<br /><br />All in all, an ok piece."
4.0,"Bought this for my teen granddaughter,  she loves them, the look, the fit."
4.0,Tight stretch not flimsy
4.0,quality leather hard to see logo
4.0,Sadly I got this in the weather changed very quickly so he only got to use it a few times. The position of the zippers and how it works makes it easy to put a very squirmy child in
4.0,"Weird, square shoulders, but I otherwise like it."
4.0,My wife loves it and that is what matters. I was little disappointed about the material though at first.
4.0,The color was a little faded compared to photo but I still like it very much!
4.0,"Looks great - very thick, The only issue I have is mine had one edge that wasn't finished/sealed. Because of that it will wear out quicker. Still a nice looking strap for my Citizen eco-drive - especially since I changed the black buckle for a chrome one to match the watch case."
4.0,"Another cheap jewelry purchase. It is a nice, hefty, crystal pedant that hangs low and gives you something to play with when you are bored and fidget."
4.0,"Very nice style and design.  The sweater fits a little small for size.  When brought to the seller‚Äôs attention without hesitation they gave me a partial refund since I ordered the largest size.  I am happy to give it to an in law, who absolutely loved it."
4.0,"Decent shirt, knocked down one star because the front of the shirt where it's pleated sits funny on me - kind of makes it look like my tummy is bigger than it is. But overall this is a very comfy shirt"
4.0,The material has a great stretch.
4.0,"Not bad, not great."
4.0,Ottoman was just what I expected. Color and size are just what I needed to tuck under the coffee table when not needed as an ottoman.
4.0,These were exactly what I wanted. The hoops are tiny and hug my ears closely. I've had them in for a couple weeks straight and they must be real silver because they haven't discolored at all and I haven't had any irritation to me ears either. They are comfortable to sleep on too. I only took a star off because they are hard as **** to get in. I had to have my husband secure them for me. I know they could design them better to fix that issue.
4.0,I purchased it for myself and hoped it would cover my ears and keep them warm like the picture shows the ears covered. But it doesn't really stay over my ears and comes up. I like it but not for very cold.
4.0,Would be a 5 star product if design was on both sides
4.0,Good quality hat. It's not super comfortable on my head but it looks nice!
4.0,I bought several pair/packs. They are nice but a little pricey...
4.0,"Soft and has great material but it runs a little tight, recommend going one size up than your usual."
4.0,"Cute socks, my 5 year old likes them. They are a thinner sock, so not sure how well they'll hold up, but are good for sliding into shoes that fit snugly."
4.0,"Great jacket for a north face , of course. Order my wife a medium and she is 5‚Äô6 , average build. She has minimal movement in her arms and hip area. Had to return but still a great jacket!"
4.0,"very cute, but very large. had to return"
4.0,"pretty, shiny, arrived on time"
4.0,Used this for a pink out color day at school and it was great.
4.0,"Very comfortable and durable pants. I wear these for volunteering at a dog shelter. Love the multiple pockets. Not super fashionable, but perfect for what I need."
4.0,"Though I expected the torso/body to be loose, the arms are too baggy and long for my arms. Not a big deal.  I'm a very busty 5'4&#34; person and like the length (covers my butt so I can comfortably wear skinny jeans or leggings underneath). I wore it casually at home before adding some jewelry and going out with family for the evening.  The material is very comfortable, too."
4.0,Fit well. Gives a nice shape and the pattern is very cool.
4.0,Funny costume we are using for fantasy football loser of the week pics. Head is hard to put on roght.
4.0,Nice leggings. Good quality. Good package. Feels much more comfortable with high waist than the regular ones I purchased before. Good and reliable company .
4.0,Bought this for a wheelchair bound nursing home resident.  Its perfect for her!!!!
4.0,Love this top fits just like the picture
4.0,"Very cute. I have very small feet, almost always a 5.5 so that‚Äôs what I ordered. Today was the first day I wore them and they felt tight at first, but at the end of a work day without much walking they have stretched out ALOT width wise (see picture). I always put heel cushions in my flats but no blisters or areas that rub. They almost feel like slippers. They are very light with minimal structure or support so keep that in mind if it is something you are looking for. For the price, variety of colors and styles this brand comes in, I would totally order again and if they let 6 months to a year I will be fine with that."
4.0,A little smaller that expected. A little tight but very comfy and good quality.
4.0,I do like these strappy bottoms but the picture is a straight up lie. There are 2 pieces in the crotch/groin area that are not together. So you will have to sew them together or wear &#34;real&#34; panties with them. They look awesome though. Fit me just fine but I'm also 5'5 and 115 pounds.
4.0,My wife loves it. It bought it for her for a trip. The size and color were spot on.
4.0,Very nice and for a good price!
4.0,Lovely dress for the price. The material is slippery and not highly quality. I have washed and air dried with no issues. However the dress has tons of creases and wrinkles that I hope the steamer can remove. Dress seems to run true to size. I typically wear a size 4-6 in dresses and it fit spot on. The underarm at the bust is a little larger than necessary. The buttons are very cheap and loose I will most likely replace them.
4.0,It is beautiful and I look forward to buying more on Amazon.
4.0,Material seems thinner than other Miracle suit by Kirkland but still like. Like it has adjustable straps and it runs longer than lots of swim tops
4.0,"Cute but Dry Clean Only?? , who dry clean their 6 month old clothing?"
4.0,"The mask was as described , but a little loose on my face. It will work when I need a special mask."
4.0,I'm 5'11'' and the medium fits okay. It's a little short but with flats I think it will work!
4.0,Cute and made well.. only prob was i got 2 blacks and thwyre a lil short..but tohwr than that i like them and theyre slimming
4.0,"I love these pants I‚Äôve been looking for a cheap pair of yoga pants and these are right up my alley. They are very soft and stretchy, along with very dependable great fabric. They run a bit to big. Love these ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4.0,Size medium is huge more like large but fabric is so soft and thin & flowy  but not transparent
4.0,"You will need to go by their size chart. It runs smaller than US. But if it fits, it does a great job without rolling down. Unfortunately, it doesn't go above a US size 14."
4.0,"Both watches were awesome but the red one had a rip in the band, is there a way I can order the red band"
4.0,Not too to size. ordered my usual size and it was pretty tight. It‚Äôs still good quality and cute though
4.0,"I like this brand of glasses. You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a good looking pair of shades. IMO you really get more than what you pay for. (Side note: If you can find a wholesaler and purchase them in bulk, you will be saving a lot more money)"
4.0,I love this shirt. It's just a bit short for me.. but I still can't help but wear it I just wish it was a bit longer..
4.0,It look like an expensive watch but that is not the reason I bought this watch. It feel good on my wrist. Working correctly is all I wanted. Good watch for this price
4.0,I bought this tie to go with my burgundy belt and shoes and it matched perfectly. It gave my suit outfit the classic conservative look I was going for. The tie length is long enough for a Windsor knot. I'm very happy with this purchase. I have about 80 ties and this one is now in my weekly rotation.
4.0,I bougjt these conpression sleeves because they were cheap. I went into the purchase thinking that if they werent all that great id only be loosing ten bucks but i was actually suprised by the quality. They seem tk be really well made and for 10 bucks i see no need tk buy any of the other more expensive brands. Like im curious is to how the manufacturer even makes money off these. There a little tight but that is my only complaint so far. Im really impressed with these and will be buyong these again in the future when they start to wear down
4.0,"I went up 2 sizes and still was small for me.  My waist is a 33, but cute."
4.0,"Very pretty, but looks a bit cheap."
4.0,"Negative heel makes an awkward walking gait. Very lightweight and comfortable for running or sprinting, especially for those who run on their toes."
4.0,"The dress was really nice and made well.  However, once I put it on all bets were off.  It was a good maternity dress but I have a great granddaughter!  It really needs to shaped at the waist.  Sorry!"
4.0,This jacket is kind of heavy but very warm.
4.0,As long as it doesn't shrink when washed. It is a good length and fit all over. Very happy with the style!.
4.0,"I love the embroidery and the zipper on the side with the stretchy back. It‚Äôs such a fashionable skirt. The only problem is if you‚Äôre a bigger bottomed girl and wear tights/leggings underneath, the skirt slides up and exposes the backside so you just gotta be careful if you‚Äôre curvy"
4.0,"This is a beautiful garment and the workmanship is excellent.  My only complaint is that the straps are extremely short.  I'm not a tall woman, but even with the straps at full extension, this bra is uncomfortable for me.  I do have to admit that it is a little more padded than I expected, but it is not excessively padded.  If I can find a way to extend the straps, it will be a great bra.  And I do love the color!"
4.0,Love it! A little scratchy but I‚Äôm sure that will soften up after I wash it. Too cute for words and fits perfect!
4.0,Product is durable!
4.0,"The ad stated stainless steel but when I received the product it has imprint ""925"". they are heavy which is okay.They took a very long time to arrive."
4.0,Nice handbag.
4.0,"Great quality, but odd color. I was hoping it would seem more appealing in person, but it really is an odd color. If color isn't a concern, it is a well made style from North Face, and washes well"
4.0,"Flattering fit, must be hand washed ‚Ä¶.decent sweater, will keep."
4.0,Good workmanship for price. Would look too bulky on small hands.
4.0,"These are nice shorts. My husband is only 5'6 so the waist is a little long so he has to roll over the waist band so it hits him on the hip bone verses above the belly button. (since he has more of a &#34;dad bod&#34; verses the photo, lets just say he understands the term muffin top much better if not rolled over).  The length on the legs is fine and works great under his workout pants. I am assuming that they will preform great while he lifts, but since he can not recall the last time he lifted... ... Jan 1 is coming, maybe that is what he is waiting for.  He did use them running the other day and said they felt great, kept &#34;everything&#34; in place and kept the sweat away. Maybe they should make a compression bra for the ladies! I was given a discount to try these and give my honest review. Since he liked them, he wants more."
4.0,Very Nice purse. lots of pockets to organize. Not too deep or shallow. really nice
4.0,Nice color and quality but I need a smaller size.
4.0,"Overall nice dress. I am about 233 pounds, and 5 feet 3 inches tall and I ordered an extra large. It fit very close to expected but a tad looser around the waist than I thought it would be. The dress actually ends a bit higher than I thought, too - right at my knees. The sleeves are nice and fit perfectly. The lace feels nice and is not itchy. The only complaints I have are that the top lace on the dress is not scalloped as it is in the picture. Also, the slip was sewn inside out, which isn‚Äôt a big deal since you can‚Äôt tell when wearing the dress. Overall, a good buy."
4.0,Nice quality belt. Was wondering if it would stay tight as other belts of this type have a tendency to slip. This one slips just slightly from the tightened position I had the belt in when wearing it. We'll see how this works as I've had it longer. Nice package and presentation if you're giving it as a gift.
4.0,"This did break after 2 weeks because its got caught on my skirt button. But nothing I couldn't fix with my needle nose plyers. Honestly its probably just the fact that I'm a cluts, that it broke. This looks really cute on and I can match with a lot of outfits. It looks high quality and its a great deal for the price."
4.0,A little higher neckline than I thought and different fabric but it‚Äôs cute!
4.0,NICE  WRITING IS SMALL BUT ALOT TO SAY IN A LITTLE SPACE
4.0,Like all off the shoulders it always pops up off your arm and goes over your shoulders. Just gotta constantly pull it back down but it's soooooooo cute. Got tons of compliments
4.0,"These shoes come pretty much as advertised.  They're fun shoes to wear with a skirt and fairly comfortable, even with the tall heel.  They do run a tiny bit narrow.  The only thing to be aware of is that there is a clear acrylic insert between the front straps, so your feet get a little sweaty.  Other than that, I'm pretty happy with these shoes."
4.0,Nice pants wrong fit for my husband but on someone else might be fine
4.0,"Very comfortable boot, however they are not high quality and wont last long.  The materials are not great quality by t they look good.  Just don't expect to wear them for more than a couple months.  They serve the purpose I bought them for. Enjoying them while they last."
4.0,"Beautiful lace pattern, but little support as would be expected."
4.0,"Even though their is no breast support, they look great under some too low cut tops that I have. with built in bras."
4.0,"They are different sizes so some didn‚Äôt fit, some fit perfectly and others are too big"
4.0,Perfect for a Wednesday Adams costume. A little small but looked great on my daughter.
4.0,Love this outfit. Soo adorable on. Fits a little big buy has room to grow into.
4.0,Really great ski mask. I have other ones that I have been using and when I bought this one it was by far one of the best ones I've ever had on.
4.0,Good quality and cute Pokemon faces. Adjustable and good coverage.
4.0,"Used this at my son's wedding. It matched my gown so well people thought I had bought them together. Some beads were hanging by a thread (ha, ha) but I didn't care."
4.0,"Love this bracelet, only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the clasp is so hard to put on and take off. Took 20 min to get on.  Wish it was made with a magnet clasp!"
4.0,"It is a lovely skirt, but not nearly as long as the picture implies. Still pretty, though."
4.0,It was too long.
4.0,"Lightweight, easy to clean flips that I keep at the rec center for walking on the pool deck and in the shower."
4.0,"Bought these for my teenager. She loves them, but they are very big & bulky on the ear.  Very unique earring though!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs an easy summer dress it‚Äôs pretty I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 125 lbs, it lands at the right spot above the knees. I purchased small fits just right. Fabric is not sheer feels ok."
4.0,"Great product, only coin pocket not comfortable, because a little hard to take off coins (very narrow slot).<br />Instead that it has leather‚Äôs scent, I like it."
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it fits great and I'm happy with it overall. I'm happy I bought it, and any Stone Sour fan would like it too!!!"
4.0,"This is a beautiful pebbled leather purse. It's lightweight & stands, rather than a boho type. It has a large compartment, 2 slip pockets, a zippered compartment & then finally the compartment in the front with the turn key. It came packaged extremely well. I removed the dog tag so as not to scratch the nice chains. It could hang just a tad lower, but overall I'm completely satisfied with this purse. This red oxblood is more of a dark brown- so it's a year round color, rather than just a Fall color. On a sunny day you can see a burgundy undertone.<br />Update:  I'm sorry to say this purse couldn't handle 6 months of my daily abuse. Honestly, I'm careful & respectful with my purses. The two interior pockets separated when the middle unraveled. It's very easy to fix by myself. I will just go back to Dooney purses- they're made to last a lifetime. I have more than I care to admit."
4.0,"I'm not a ukelele guru, so this will just be my humble opinion. I do like the design and convenience of the strap. However, the clips do come off easily and fall off from the ukelele when I take off the strap from my shoulder. I also noticed buzzing sound from the clips vibrating while I'm playing the instrument. I sometimes prefer not to use the strap since the clips move around and the buzzing sound. However, it is a great value and a great option for those who do not want to drill a hole on their precious ukelele."
4.0,"I'm pretty new to the Allegra K line - I think this is my second purchase - and so far so good! The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the color...I find the black to be more of an off black (lite black, I guess) and I was looking for a truer black. I have several pairs of black pants and couldn't get the black to match...instead I wore jeans and it looked fine.<br />The material is a poly/spandex blend, but the fit is loose and flowy, so you probably won't need the stretch. I'm 5'5 size 18 and found the fit to be right on...maybe almost too big, but that is the look for this type of top.<br />Price is great for what you get.<br />Would buy again in different patterns/colors!"
4.0,"Super soft, very messy looses a lot of material and leaves a mess"
4.0,"The socks are very cute and comfortable.  I wish the images were a little clearer, but overall cute socks!"
4.0,"Nice, like it a lot the chain was twisted but it's an easy fix!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a cute top, true to size. I got a small like I do in all my shirts and it fit well."
4.0,Very light weight.  Not very durable!  Broke 1st time the boys played with them.
4.0,Heavy winter scarf- a little bulky for all day wear. Pretty though.
4.0,"Bought for an 80s party. I thought inwas getting lightening bolt earrings but received fishnet hoses. Not impressed with those, but everything else was great"
4.0,These boots are the only ones I've found that are truly slip resistant.  Love these boots.  Only problem is water proofing don't last the life of the boot.
4.0,It's ok.<br />Not bad and not the best quality outthere
4.0,"Initially, I was a little disappointed in this dress as it fit me a bit loose, but I quickly worked around it by using the belt it came with to get a nicer fit. This dress is a thin, flowy material that's perfect for summer. I like that the buttons in front actually work and aren't just decoration. Overall I'm happy with it. It's very cute and I can't wait to wear it out. I'm normally a size 4 (got the small) and as stated, it fit a bit loose in the waist area."
4.0,"It is more than my expectations, but it has only one default that the day and date is not easy to be seen"
4.0,"I was honestly so scared to order this but I'm happy I did. I'm 5'7 - 138 pounds and ordered a Medium. It didn't fit large but it wasn't super tight, it was comfortable. The boobs are not padded so you can kinda see your nipple but i don't mind. Im a 34C so my boobs aren't the biggest and it looks sexy ish, but I can totally see how someone with bigger boobs would look super hot. The material is decent, similar to basic Target bathing suits. The strings are a little too long but i'm guessing thats because they're adjustable and can just cut them. The only Con I can really find is the bottom. It has buttons to button up on the crotch like a onesie, other than that this bathing suit is comfy, sexy and girly.<br />UPDATE: I wore this suite on my vacation trip, and kept having to re adjust it in my boobs. I think it was a little too big. Also, I machine washed it and it all ripped.... so handwash !"
4.0,Love these jammies but size up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 about 145 lbs and ordered a large and they are tight
4.0,Very cute but small
4.0,These are fine.  I have small arms and they fit perfectly.
4.0,"I haven't tried to use my phone while having these on. The styling is super, they are really nice looking. I found them very stiff at first but they soften as worn. Comfortable and warm."
4.0,i thought they'd be more comfortable.  kind of restrictive - not as much stretch in material to really warrant a name that includes the word &#34;pajama&#34;.  i still prefer leggings.
4.0,Like them a lot! Color is not quite black - more a charcoal gray.
4.0,quit nice. Hard to tell colors on-line was more on blue side than I expected.  Fabric is great - smooth and soft
4.0,Good. My GF love them and she Haven using for a while. They still in a good shape and good quality.
4.0,"This is a cute top, however it runs very small. I even ordered a size larger and it still was too small. Im normally a small, based on the sizing I ordered the medium I should of ordered a large or xl. Cute top though."
4.0,I wish it shipped faster but it was worth the wait. Super adorable! The skirt is fuller than I expected which was a nice surprise
4.0,Nylon strap is very nice hardware feels very cheap
4.0,update 10-20-20 the little knob to turn the knob on the watch has broken off now I‚Äôm in able to press it or operate in any way. And I‚Äôm have problems contacting the seller
4.0,Bem leve
4.0,"I really like this dress - it looks just like it does in the pictures and fits well. The top is lovely. Consider this, though: I have very lean arms and it is tight on my arms, so may be hard to get into. Also, I usually wear dresses that are fitted through the hips, and this one is VERY &#34;flowy,&#34; making it much more conservative and less body-accentuating than I'm used to. I wish the pretty top were on a more flattering skirt! I'm 5'8&#34; 130 33/27/37 and the 4 fit well."
4.0,"They are exactly what I was looking for, except I think I had a different color in my head.  But as with all new shoes they need to be broken in before I can  wear them all day."
4.0,I absolutely love the top to this one. I‚Äôve worn it multiple times but with black bottoms. I am a little worry to wear it anywhere rough like the beach because it doesn‚Äôt seem like the best material... but it‚Äôs still super cute for the pool. I‚Äôm not a fan of the bottoms but mostly it‚Äôs cause I don‚Äôt like the Brazilian type bottoms where they pull up to over my hip bones.
4.0,Definitely a nice casual shirt. :)
4.0,Nice design<br />Easy to put in
4.0,Very comfy.  Would prefer it to be longer in length and have a higher neckline.
4.0,Belt worked well. Item as described.
4.0,Love this light weight jacket. Perfect length. Color is great.
4.0,"They don't perfectly relieve my discomfort, but it's definitely easier to get through the work day."
4.0,Love the sweater the sleeves are a little short for me!
4.0,"I love the dress itself, I just wish I had gotten a smaller size. I used to be a 14 and thought it would still fit but for it to look perfect I need a 12. I wanted it for a friends wedding but don't think I'll get it back on time if I return it. The dress itself is nice. I have pretty large natural breast and was worried about not wearing a bra. I was like heck no! But I'm sure fitting the right size it would be just fine. Even in the 14 they sit right but again, a smaller size would have just hugged all the right areas just right. Buts it's a nice dress. I got got black floral one but it kinda looks blue or navy blue in a weird way. Funny cause I was looking for the navy blue like in all the pictures."
4.0,"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. I didn't honestly have high expectations since I've received some not so nice items in the past, but this dress is seemingly fairly well made. The dress I received had no issues with fraying or loose stitches. The lace at the top in very cute and does not look cheap. Also, the tulle that makes up the skirt is not scratchy like some mesh, but rather a soft, smooth material that lays nicely.<br />My daughter is still too young to wear this dress, but in comparison to other outfits I own of the same size, this seems comparable. There is a button up near the neck with an elastic loop closure which worked well. The only part I was not crazy about was how the bow was attached. It is sewn right in the middle, which does look a bit cheap. I wish the ribbon was sewn underneath and not as visible. The color was very nice as well and a good match to the picture online. All opinions expressed here are entirely my own and are given after thorough testing and inspection of the product. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This is super cute, however based on the pics & stuff I did expect it to be longer. It's cute, but short. Deciding if I want to keep it because it matches the Splendette bangles I bought it for.<br />For reference, I'm tall & busty (38G), so if you're petite or not as big up top, it might fit differently."
4.0,"I wish it was bigger, it doesn't stand out at all. It's pretty but you j Ave to veiw it real close.  I'm surprised Glamulet is one of my top merchants on Pandora type charms.  But I do recommend them."
4.0,They're comfortable and breathable but the top waist band is tighter than I like so my love handles show more than with a more stretchy waist band. Happy with the purchase but will not buy again.
4.0,"It‚Äôs small for me , and when I received, It‚Äôs smell not good , just like plastic. But the quality and price are nice."
4.0,"Love these! Very thin, but not low quality thin. More like, style and fabric thin."
4.0,First of all this is not Christian jewelry.  It is the symbol for Humanism.  The symbol is well made.  The chain irritated my neck so I use a chain I had.
4.0,Got these for my bridesmaids and their low cut dresses.
4.0,"Super cute and flirty, bought it for a photoshoot and have found other occasions to wear it. The waistline doesn't have any give to it so it's a little tight on me, but that's my personal issue. Also, it's not a super expensive skirt but it's kind of cheap. It was perfect for my shoot because it's easy to hide the flaws, but I would be careful with what you're buying it for. The waistline ribbon is creased and the seams up the tulle aren't cleanly done. If you're buying this for a wedding or every day use, I'd consider going elsewhere. Though they can be more expensive (like $50 maybe) I'd search on Etsy for a handmade tulle skirt this length. It would probably be worth it."
4.0,Nice size easy to carry nice features.
4.0,"Hi I‚Äôm 9 years old and I love to bake, I picked out this apron because I was tired of using my mom‚Äôs apron because it was too big! I liked the pattern on this one too. It fits me good - I‚Äôm short for nine! It is very adjustable! My mom likes that it can be washed in the washing machine because I‚Äôm also a messy baker!"
4.0,22mm is what my watch had but this one I ordered is a fraction wider causing a very tight fit and the spring pins are thinner than original pins on my diver watch and therefore had to use Zulu's pins to fit into their watch band.
4.0,"Supposed to only have ordered one, but we got two instead so I was able to keep one! It‚Äôs not to heavy and sturdy to have been from Amazon"
4.0,"My wife ordered these as she has another pair in a different color.  These fit exactly as the other.  They wash well and don‚Äôt shrink in the dryer.  This order was for ‚Äúivory,‚Äù but they are a ‚Äúsand‚Äù or ‚Äúlight khaki‚Äù color.  She kept them anyway."
4.0,"I like the design on the ring, looks detailed and intricate. I originally bought this to expand a bit to put on my pinky but I think it looks better on the toe. The sizing is nice, I like how small it is but it‚Äôs adjusrable so it leaves a bit of room to expand."
4.0,Is beautiful!!!!! I loved excellent bracelet
4.0,I've had this bracelet for a while and it does stretch but the color is still there. It hasn't broken and I can wear with anything.
4.0,Disappointed they were plastic but still cute!
4.0,Good quality but didn‚Äôt look as flattering on me as on the picture.  Returned
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter and a friend for their masquerade prom. They're definitely gorgeous, but best suited for those with smaller heads."
4.0,Took others advice and ordered a size smaller.. big mistake
4.0,Lovely ring and like the design but the silver wears away and you have copper underneath.  Sort of a cool look in its way.
4.0,"It was a grad gift from my grandma, love the center jewel"
4.0,"Soft denim jeans in a full elastic waist. Made of 98% Cotton and 2% Spandex. Easy to care for, just wash and dry.<br /><br />Our granddaughter is more the leggings type of girls, but they just moved to a new home and have a small family farm. Jeans are more appropriate when feeding chickens, getting eggs, and helping in the garden.<br /><br />These jeans work find for that type of,work, but they are not very flattering at all. Very bulky and loose around the belly. They are comfortable and suited perfect for her afternoon jaunts in the mini-farm."
4.0,"The Sorel Men's Bear 9mm ThermoPlus Innerboot NM8010,Dark Grey, size 17 M are well made and the shipping was quick and fast."
4.0,Top was a little weird but still a good buy.
4.0,"I like the product, not too long but lovely, it is the way it is shown. I recommend it for anyone looking to buy it. I am rating it four because I do not know how durable it is."
4.0,Very pretty and simple! Great necklace for the price.
4.0,"Works great and adjusts easy. Game changer for wet sneaks! It doesn't seem like the air blows very hard, but it is more than enough to get that hot air into a shoe to dry it up.<br /><br />Well made, adjustable and just plain works. Great machine for drying shoes."
4.0,Very pretty necklace and good quality. A little smaller and less flashy than the others from this line. The pink edge crystals and the gold hardware are more muted looking on my golden skin tone. The slider box chain runs smooth. You can wear it in so many ways. Returned because I was looking for more statement. One star off because the pendant keeps flipping over when worn lower than about a typical 18‚Äù chain. It‚Äôs fine when worn higher up.
4.0,"Esta bastante bien, en relaci√≥n precio calidad"
4.0,To start they sent it in a envelope. Big surprise the box they came in was crushed. The glasses seem fine maybe a little flat. They look much sturdier in the pictures. IRL they‚Äôre thin and will bend easily. The lenses are clear and block the sun well. Overall nice set of sunglasses.
4.0,"Bought these socks for an upcoming trip to wear on a long airplane flight.  Although I have not worn them very much, other than to try them on, they fit well and seem to give a comfortable level of support.  They were also fairly easy to get off and on, unlike some compression socks."
4.0,"This outfit is adorable and shipped fast. Shots are thin, but not see through. I should have ordered a size down. Both are wearable, but loose. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 150lbs."
4.0,Wore this to a 70s themed graduation party and it was a great look!! The only down fall is that these pants are super long so if you wear them you'll have to wear heels. I'm 5'4 and on the thicker side. Just keep in mind the larger you go in size the longer the pants will be! A good buy though and it did its job :)
4.0,It's so soft on your face
4.0,"Everything about this backpack is great, except it‚Äôs so small I couldn‚Äôt even fit my 1‚Äùinch binder inside it. I wanted something more fashionable for school, as I am in college. I thought this would be a great upgrade. My negative review is based on the size. The quality, design, color all fantastic. I‚Äôm returning for another Matt and Nat backpack. Upon looking for a different style the dimensions on here are listed as bigger then I see on the Matt and Nat website, unless I‚Äôm out of my mind. If your just looking for a backpack that fits quite a bit for an overnight trip or more for a purse this is a beautiful bag, for school it just didn‚Äôt work for me."
4.0,Buena inversi√≥n calidad precio
4.0,"I do like the shirt, feels soft and falls at right length for me; however, it runs small.  I like my shirts a little loose, not much, but enough to not show an outline and this one just didn't make the cut.  Returning it, but ordered a size larger.  We'll see!"
4.0,I purchased this for my 5yr old granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. The material was so soft.
4.0,"They do the job. They‚Äôre not soft or pliable, the material was surprising but effective."
4.0,Feel nice just wish material was thicker
4.0,it seems ok haven't used it yet. looks good.
4.0,"These are well made and look very cute, but they run a lot smaller than I expected. I have fairly small (women's) hands, but these are tight on me. They're also not incredibly well insulated, so I wouldn't recommend them for weather below around 32F"
4.0,Fit very well I'm 5'2 and 160 lbs and got a large
4.0,"Very pretty though better suited for younger ages, It looks a bit bigger here then it is. It looks more like a necklace I would buy for my younger sister who is ten."
4.0,they are thicker then i expected but still do the job of keeping sweat from getting in my eyes. they look just like the pic which is very nice
4.0,I like more petite jewelry so this was almost the size of a quarter and I was thinking it was smaller than a dime. It was pretty but just not my style. Saw this same pendant in Kohl‚Äôs for triple the price. Very reasonable here but ended up returning.
4.0,I originally bought these for my daughter but they are very small so ended up giving to my granddaughter... she loved them
4.0,This dress is so adorable.  The only issues is the material is a bit stiff at first but my daughter loves this dress and has worn it in pretty well now.
4.0,"I wore this dress to my cousins wedding. I was very skeptical of a one size fits all dress. The outer layer was loose and flowy. The underlayer slip was pretty tight. I‚Äôm a size twelve with thick thighs. The tight underlayer rose up constantly. I wore spanx and tucked the end of the slip hem into the legs of the spanx. It worked well, but I had to be conscious of it the entire night. I did get tons of compliments on the dress, and you can‚Äôt beat the price."
4.0,"Got this for my boyfriend and while he likes it and finds it comfortable, the fabric is not super breathable and he gets a little sweaty in it. Lost a star for that."
4.0,"I love it,for the price you can't go wrong!.....Thanks!"
4.0,"While this runs pretty small (I typically wear M but have a larger bust so sometimes I need L and this is SNUG as an XL), it is really comfortable and is fitted perfectly to my body and is made well. I would recommend this just in a larger size than you think you need!"
4.0,"Would have been nicer if more cotton was in the product, but very comfortable."
4.0,Can't stop laughing.....only downfall it is sheds a lot - I guess that makes it realistic too depending on how you look at it.
4.0,"Extra points for having zippable pockets AND a back pocket for my wallet. They really are quick-drying, which is great for sweaty guys like me. Four stars only because the stiching needs work, since some thread comes off in each wash."
4.0,I loved it but sadly it broke within four months. I tried to reorder it but it was no longer available.
4.0,"it's very cute & very good quality. my only complaint is that the material used for the tattoo part of the choker is a bit thick, so it fails to live up to the &#34;tattoo&#34; visual. other than that, it's comfy & adjustable & i wear it all the time! i just wish it looked more like a tattoo."
4.0,The cap is a typical ball cap that has an adjustable clasp in the back and fits nicely. It is not rigid so you have to work with the shape a little but it appears to be a sturdy product suitable for typical use.
4.0,"Really cute shirt, just a bit big. But I'm still keeping , hoping it will shrink just a little"
4.0,"These are a really great little pair of earrings! I wear them  comfortably in the second set of ear piercings I received - and they go with everything!!  They are quality made and the clasp is nice, it does not pinch the skin and overall I would recommend these yes - just be aware that they are very small.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B017U1FDM6 Sannysis 1Pair Beautiful Silvering Rhinestones Hoop Stud Earrings For Women-About Half an Inch]]"
4.0,"This dress looks and fits as described. The fabric is soft, stretchy, and light weight. I love the red color. It arrived with wrinkles in the skirt part and I thought it wouldn't wrinkle, but it's not bad."
4.0,pretty good no plastic cover to cover name tag
4.0,Not a Yankee fan but my girlfriend is and she loves it nice design and material. 4 more words required.
4.0,My soccer player daughter loves these shorts. She practically lives in them. The fit is as expected and very comfortable. By far her favorite shorts to wear while training.
4.0,Good for working long hours
4.0,4 stars only because we haven't tested them in water. They are well packaged and appear very sturdy. Trial wear out of water proved that they hold well to the face and secure easily in the back. Earplugs are still attached but like other reviewers I expect I'll cut those off. I'll bump to 5 if after using them for their intended purpose the do well.<br />I would purchase again.
4.0,Very cute but to small in the arms
4.0,Sized like the photo and I can't wait to wear them!
4.0,Very pretty and fun to wear.
4.0,"Love the color and length, but I thought it would be thicker, but it's thin buy I'll wear thick warm leggings underneath the skirt"
4.0,Cool hoodie for the price.
4.0,They are so warm and comfortable I just love them.
4.0,Girlfriend says the paw pads hurt her feet but loves to sleep in them
4.0,"this is the second set of these kind ive bought for my daughter, she loves them."
4.0,"I ordered Adult M for my daughter (12-year-old) base on the size guide but it turned out to be too small.  Adult L fits her nicely.  The leo is very good quality and my daughter loves it.  The only complain is about shipping.  I paid $7 for shipping for the initial order.  For exchanging size, I had to pay to ship the leo back to Snowflake Designs and another $6 for Snowflake Designs to ship it back to me."
4.0,"If you are looking for an XL band, these are by far some of the longest I have found. The band is very nice and I would give 5 stars if not for the stiff/scratchy parts of the stitch on the back of the loops that hold the band in place while wearing. I have tried trimming them with clippers but in the end flipped them around to face outward. It doesn't look horrible, but wish it were a bit more comfortable without having to do this step."
4.0,They fit ok but the elastic in the waist is way to tight and strong. Waist way to small and Not in proportion with the rest of the garment. I cut it out and inserted a drawstring and it made it better.
4.0,"I ordered a 4x, I initially chose this size based on my bust size, and it was big on me. So the bust size measurements are not true to size. However The bottom half fit me perfectly and the bust size was a bit big and had to be tacked and sewed in. Luckily my mother is a seamstress. It is a bit uncomfortable to wear if you have thick thighs like me."
4.0,"They are a bit small, but perfect for the shoes I wanted to wear them with."
4.0,"I liked this sweater.  It is cozy and definitely for a cold day but it fit well, looked professional in the office and I got many compliments on it."
4.0,its very easy to wear and not combersome
4.0,The dress is very flattering but it does run a little small
4.0,Love the shirt and the fit. It has a snug fit.  Would have given 5 stars if the T-Shirt were a higher quality soft blend.
4.0,Product came exactly as advertised. Neat looking boxes to hold your pendants and earrings. Value for money.
4.0,"Very nice underwear, the tag however was seriously irritating but once I cut it out everything was all good."
4.0,This is a really great quality costume. It‚Äôs thick and will keep you warm. The only thing I can say they need to watch out for are rips on the costume. Luckily I have a small rip between in index finger and middle finger on my left hand. Easy sewing fix before my costume party. Definitely would look at the measurements on the costume sizing because I‚Äôm usually a small in clothes . I weigh 126lbs and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 in height & it fits like a glove( I ordered a medium adult ) ! I hope this review helps for future buyers!
4.0,"I am happy with these!  Originally they felt a little snug, but loosened up (but not too much) quickly.  I love the bamboo socks, and like to purchase several pairs of the same color for easy matching.  After shopping around, I decided these were the best price.  They hold up reasonably well, and I will be happy to purchase them again when necessary."
4.0,Cute shirt-I ordered a Small and fits closer to a M-L.
4.0,"Everything i love about it except it leaves fuzz on whatever you wear under it, nothing a lint roller can't fix, but it is still slightly annoying."
4.0,"im normally a 12/14 so I ordered an xl, the tag says large (so watch for that) but it still fits well. This is a soft, flattering, comfortable dress. I will definitely buy all colors. I just wish there were more than three available! A henley dress, brilliant.<br />Edit: I ordered a second one in burgundy and it's more of a dark red, which is why I took away a star"
4.0,They are great in every way except one. They don't hold my package in. My stuff be sticking out all the time. Which is fine untill I'm at work or the gym
4.0,"I sized up one, although the chart said I should get a size 2, I bought the 4 (I'm 5'9&#34; 120 lbs. 33, 26, 33.5) that being said, they fit great, it's a nice thicker, stretchy fabric and they are even long enough (see photos)"
4.0,Love this shirt. Have had commitments on it. True to size. Make sure you don't dry shirt.  Mama part might get damaged.
4.0,"The sleeves were a bit short, but the style is nice!"
4.0,"Very comfortable and flexible.  I'm about 6'1"", 230 lbs and it's not too much of a stretch for the material.  I would buy again."
4.0,"This beanie is incredible. Not only is it a comfortable hat, but it is also an ambitious way of implementing Bluetooth technology. I enjoy this product for both its ability to play music and also for the fact that is a comfortable fashion statement.<br />  In terms of speaker quality, it's pretty good. Saying that it is amazing is a bit of a stretch however. There is no noise cancellation with this product, which doesn't really affect my review score as I don't mind that, but for those of you who are expecting such a thing- don't expect it. Also know that the beanie's insides are not supplemented with earbuds, but rather a sort of stereo headphones. If you really want to hear whatever you are listening to, you will have to lean on your hand or do something similar.<br />  That is not to say that this is a bad product. The overall quality of the beanie is excellent, and the black beanie that I purchased is simple and I love it for that. It also has a nice battery life, typically lasting you through the day if it is used with moderation.<br />  Here's my perspective- $20 for a neat little gadget that you can wear on your head? It's a stellar idea. This product is totally worth the $20 purchase price, but just remember that it doesn't have the best sound quality in the world. Nonetheless, it is still an amazing product that I recommend to anybody."
4.0,Very happy with the construction and durability of this product. I might need to buy another color! Another happy customer.
4.0,"I am 5'1 140lbs 34ddd chest and medium bottoms (size 5 jeans). This fits almost perfectly for me. I ordered a large (sold out of medium) and the bottoms fit great, it is a thong and the cut isnt too high like a previously ordered one. The top is adjustable for length, but it is kind of loose on me. I should have gotten a size smaller but they were sold out. Great for the price."
4.0,Have had this bag for several months. It is durable and easy to clean
4.0,Product does seem a little heavy.
4.0,Bought two packs of these. The majority of them were great!  Two were unraveled and unusable but the rest were great
4.0,"The watch has a smaller diameter than many pocket watches but is still a great deal.  The only disappointment I had was that it mentions you will receive a wood box but the one I got was in a cheap tin box with a plastic lid.  After contacting JDS about this, they said they would send a wood box to replace it, but I have yet to receive it."
4.0,Kind of baggy on me. I'm 5'7&#34; 125 lbs. size 34 b bra. No directions either which scared me but I figured it out by looking at the Amazon picture.  I'll make it work. It's really cute. Thanks!
4.0,"Love the color & the style, but it's tight at the chest.  It's super light & folds up nicely.  I wish they had the larger size in this color."
4.0,"The sports bras are good, especially five for about $30. I got a 3x, which for me was very good. The bra brought my breast closer together but the shoulder straps could have been a little shorter to prevent bounciness. The fabric is double layered making it thicker than I prefer. After using it on a hot day I can't say if I was sweater in that area or not, so it seems fine. They are designed with thin cups in the breasts, which is how most of them are designed today, but I personally do not like that and it was very easy to take out.  The first time I tried mine I had not prewashed it, wanting to make sure I liked it, and there was a lot of lint stuck to me. I do advise that if you like them wash them before using.  Overall they are good and comfortable for my workouts and walks."
4.0,Very nice sweater. I ordered brown and I was impressed. The color is very deep and rich. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3 so the length of sleeves and overall length of sweater worked out great for me. I was slightly disappointed with the thickness. Many of the reviews described how thick the sweater is and it‚Äôs just normal.
4.0,"It has a simple elegance to it and the fit was perfect.  I feel it needs a slip under it, but it is great for my needs."
4.0,"I am 5'6', 125. pants fit just like on the model, and were very loose and baggy. Would fit 5'5 to 5' 7 with rolled hem fine. Rolled twice hits below my knee. I thought they were one-size and did not select a size.Color is light mint green, the blue is a french blue, brown leaves and dark grey stripped leaves with med blue flowers. Looks good paired with med. colored blue jean shirt, med or dark gray black and white stripped shirt, black or grey Top. I have the same pair of pants in the mustard-gold. The fabric on that pant is a heavier cotton duck. This pant is a medium cotton and softer. Maybe they prewashed it more. ALSO This is the back of the pant featured as the front. You could use either. The other side has a pocket flap on the chest on both pairs, as well as some purposely shredded, distressed &#34;holes&#34; in the fabric."
4.0,"It hasn't gotten cold enough in the south to test these for warmth, but my son likes the fit & look."
4.0,Love these pants second pair in white great fit .
4.0,"I love the owl on the tote; I was surprised to find the plain side when I received it. Overall, I enjoy using it."
4.0,Shipping took a little longer than I wanted.  The fit and quality is ok for this price point.
4.0,"Really like the cut and style of the material. However, it does feel a itchy on my skin. I have several other handmade merino wool garments that are much softer. This may be due to the synthetic material blended in or the wool itself may be over 20 micro wool. This item is fitted so go a size up if you don't like fitted sweaters. I wear a long sleeve under armor style shirt underneath and it keeps me comfortably warm while doing outside chores in 15 to 20 degree Fahrenheit. Made the mistake of washing with a pink fleece sweater. It's covered in pink fuzz now.<br />Overall its nice to see sportswear being made with wool. Wool does a much better job at keeping you warm without getting too hot or sweaty if you are active in cold climates than cotton or synthetics. Price is reasonable for the amount of wool used."
4.0,"Looks beautiful, thought it was going to be smaller, but still looks nice."
4.0,I use them to cover my snakebite when on duty and no one seems to have noticed it. Only downside is that I keep chewing on the little mofos and destroy them within one wearing.
4.0,These glasses are fantastic. Wonderfully oversized and a gorgeous pink tint (if you get those). I've received so many compliments and nearly shocked my professor by my super duper fashionista glasses. Buy a case.
4.0,"Very pretty, have already gotten compliments.  Nice and durable although did come with one ring falling off.  I will simply have to fix that with my pliers at home."
4.0,"Very comfortable dress, I wore it for an outdoor  wedding reception.  There was very slight snagging on the dress from sitting on a wooden bench. It looked like I had tiny hairs on it. Otherwise, I had many complements."
4.0,"I was a little worried ordering a swimsuit online and not being able to try it on prior. As others have said, the top is not as supportive as I'd like, but honestly I haven't found many suits that support all that well anyway. I purchased the red suit with white polka-dots and in most light, it looks more hot pink than red, which is a bit disappointing, but it is still cute. Another concern of mine was my short torso and shot stature (5ft 1). Others had said they had issues with this, but I ordered the size I needed according to the chart, and surprisingly it fits well. Perhaps this is in part due to my belly chubbiness. (I haven't got that pre-baby body back yet, but this suit makes me feel pretty damn good). I love the retro style and this is perhaps the most flattering suit I've ever owned."
4.0,"Love the dress! The design is beautiful, the material is wonderful. The material is thin yet does not expose imperfections. It nicely hangs on you. Not very fitted which I like. I would give it five stars, but the shoulders are too broad for me. I think I should have gone one size down. I did follow the sizing chart but the dress is too big in the shoulder area. Would love to exchange it for a smaller size but hate going through a hassle, so maybe I'll just suffer with shoulders that are too big."
4.0,Runs big! Very pretty though. My granddaughter Loved it.
4.0,"A bit smaller than expected, and no give. Ordering bigger size."
4.0,A little higher waisted than I usually like.  But I could tell there would not be a size that would fit perfectly
4.0,"As an adult, I appreciate the kid's version of this belt fits in my smaller belt loops."
4.0,"This is a very nice Bralette with soft fabric.  However, the line of lace across my back is itchy.  I have washed it once and it hasn't helped.  This item provides medium support (38D), but I was not too happy with the fact that the lace in the front does ride up and roll.  Part of the reason I liked this concept was the lace coverage, but it does nearly no good rolled up under my cups.  All in all though, very nice."
4.0,Cute but a little snug.
4.0,"I really liked these shoes. They‚Äôre very cute, unfortunately it does run small...I think the description should be changed to runs ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù. The length was fine, but I have a regular to regular-wide foot so it did not fit.<br /><br />If you have skinny feet they will fit fine.<br /><br />I may have been able to wear these if they made a 7 Wide"
4.0,"This same bracelet is at Sears for 9.99 I bought one however the second day I had it the anchor charm fell off,its a great bracelet just make sure charms are secure"
4.0,"These are great. I've only wore a couple of them so far, but I like the way they look and feel. These go in easily and are very easy to snap together. It took a few minutes to get used to the weight, but after that it wasn't an issue and they felt comfortable all day. They appear to be well made, the colors are very close to the picture. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I've had one earring that the closure was a little loose, but it still stayed in place."
4.0,"it was said to take a month to arrive- but came earlier. It was one size fits all. A bit big for me  - but good for my purpose, sleeping and swimsuit cover for travel to warm climate"
4.0,The band fits and looks perfect. Just a tad bit darker than expected but will keep.
4.0,"Literally broke when I took it out of the box. The buckle broke. Thankfully, I was able to fix it, and I don't plan on using this watch long term.<br /><br />UPDATE: The customers service people reached out to me shortly after I posted this review and were able to refund my money! It's a great watch!"
4.0,"This is very nice, comfortable glasses. It protects you pretty good against the sun. Just the complaint about the smell which is quite awful (similar to asphalt), but it goes away in a few days."
4.0,for the price it is amazing
4.0,"Best album by one of the best hard rock bands of all time. Glad I found this one. Could be softer, but it's not bad."
4.0,This women‚Äôs handbag is quite classy for the price. I purchased the Apple Green & Black variant. I have received compliments from women at work as well as those outside. The bag is not only practical for work but also stylish for evenings/weekends. The long (shoulder) strap & the bow are detachable. The inside has two small zippers (which I use for lip balm/lipstick & Bluetooth/earphones). Across these are 2 small compartments of different sizes (one holds my mobile & the other keys). The middle is further split into 2 sections (which I use for my mini purse & miscellaneous things). I use the zippered pocket at the back to hold my office ID card.
4.0,"Just received this bag, super cute! It will hold everything I need it to. Only bad this is the tag the says ‚ÄúHand made bags‚Äù on the front is crooked."
4.0,"First impressions, it looks awesome, and it feels great!<br />I have one concern, I wish it was just a little bit longer in the trunk/torso area. Like an extra 1.5 to 2 inches."
4.0,"I bought this because it said it fit waist size 23-27 inches. I'm right in the middle of that (25), and it was really snug and fairly unflattering. It is a nice looking belt, so I gave it to a friend with a smaller waist size and it works great for her."
4.0,my mother like it
4.0,"Pretty dress, got for a cruise but ended up keeping another dress instead."
4.0,"I'm 5,9 & a US ladies 16 or 14W. Drapes nicely to partially cover my knees. Decent quality material for the cost."
4.0,The Belt is well-made. However I wish that the inside of the belt would have been white rather than tan.
4.0,"These are really pretty and I have been enjoying wearing them over the holiday, but they're a lot smaller than they look in the picture. They are actually only half an inch in diameter."
4.0,The idea is great that these goggles would fit over glasses but the reality is putting a hat or helmet on with them pushes them on the nose making it a little hard to breathe. It was disappointing. They did fit over the glasses and if you weren‚Äôt going to wear something on your head I think they would be great.
4.0,"A very nice bag.  Not as soft a leather as I would find ideal, but this purse is very nicely crafted.  It is heavy -- much more so than anticipated.  As a result, once you put in a wallet, phone and the usual other items, it really gets to be a hefty lift.  I think that's its biggest detractor."
4.0,Helps cut headlight glare.
4.0,"I didn't have to wait long for this item (2 days) and I'm quite satisfied with it. I'm 5'1, 105lbs and a 34C so I ordered a small. It fits me perfectly! The material is stretchy, comfortable and soft so I had no problem putting it on. However, at the same time I also dislike the material. Think of it like makeup, it has that glossy/shiny finish to it rather than that nice matte finish we all love lol But the shirt is really cute and I'm in love with it."
4.0,Bigger than thought.
4.0,Great for monroe piercing
4.0,The lenses pop put every time I clean them but they're really cute on
4.0,"This pattern/style isn't as vibrant as it looked in photos. It is more pastel/muted than bright. If that's your thing, then you'll probably give it 5 stars. I like the more random style of the pattern, and it's very artsy. However, I expected it to be bolder."
4.0,Purchased for my daughter.  Fits as expected and received on time.
4.0,Great poduct the nylon teeth grip the shirts very well.  You don't have to worry about them slipping off. I tried the Y design and it is much better than using four shirt stays. The only issue I have is in my opinion the price is a bit high for some shirt stays but other than that they are a good product.
4.0,The charm is very good quality but the little chain a little to mendable.
4.0,"I wear a women‚Äôs 7 and these were pretty tight. I think, for my shoe size, they shouldn‚Äôt be so small. That‚Äôs a pretty standard women‚Äôs shoe size so, unless you like tight socks or have a small foot, these might not work. Overall, they seem pretty good quality."
4.0,Haven't used it yet so I hope it runs but very goodlooking!
4.0,"The shirt fits really well, and the pockets are great! The only down side is the holes the buttons slide through. When taking the buttons out they sometimes get stuck on a string and then that pulls the fabric together below it. If you stretch it out, the shirt goes back to normal. More of an annoyance than anything.  Still recommend this shirt!"
4.0,"This is a super chic tote bag perfect for days with a clear sky (as the opening has no zipper) which has 2 sides for you to use (red and black with the little bag inside in black). It is quite roomy and stylish. The textured faux leather used on both sides/surfaces is relatively soft while still sturdy. The colors are vibrant. I only had a couple of issues with a few black stains (really small) on the red side and the fact that since the design requires you to inside the bag out to enjoy the other color, you have to e very careful with what you put inside and to not destroy the leather since there is no lining and you will want to kepp the inside clean in case you want to use the tote in that color. Otherwise, I am very happy with this order.<br /><br />The shipping was fulfilled by Amazon and the item arrived as promised and in great packaging. The bag was also nicely packed and put in nice white cloth bag which I kept in case I need to store the item since I have a lot of these babies and I need to keep them clean! However, there are a couple of faint black stains on the red side of the tote bag which are sort of annoying but nothing big or noticeable.<br /><br />The smaller bag which you can use to maintain a clean inner side since you will end up using the bag inside out later, is only black which works anyway and is roomy itself as you can place your wallet, makeup, or ipad inside it. But if you want to use the inside directly, you have to be careful not to make a mess or stain the leather (especially the red side) since you do not want to ruin it for later when you want to use the inside out bag. The contrast of red and black is super chic and awesome, both inside and out. Even though simple and plain, this tote bag is super fun and classy. I love it."
4.0,Cute tie.
4.0,The skirt has very pretty colors and it a great length.
4.0,Super cute and looks just like the picture. There are imprints of the straps on the bag from being pressed together in shipping though
4.0,This was a gift for my mother-in-law so that she can keep her cellphone near her in case of accidental falls. Works as needed.
4.0,"Wearing, but pills"
4.0,Cute and a nice way to dress up leggings a bit
4.0,"They are a Christmas gift , I bought them as an up size, they will fit<br />thank you"
4.0,"This is a well-made, cute purse. I have to admit it is quite a bit larger than I was expecting...and I was hoping for something smaller. But that's my fault for not paying attention to the measurements. Fits plenty of stuff and looks good."
4.0,"Most fit mid calf, one is a bit longer. I like the quality and feel. Great for summer. However, though they are high waisted, there is no tummy control, or support. Not a huge deal, but don't expect to be ""held in"" by the high waist."
4.0,"Pretty decent quality, comes off easily if you can‚Äôt clip it in right though. Definitely not something I regret buying, quick to put on and looks nice at work or in class or on dates."
4.0,This is a nice leather belt.  It fits to size and has worked well since I purchased it.
4.0,"These are really cute, and I've received compliments on them. They're double knit, so there's no loose strips inside to catch your fingers on. Also, the second layer makes them warmer.<br /><br />I have small hands, and they are loose and comfie. I wish my hands were a touch bigger so that they were a bit more form fitting, but they are fine.<br /><br />Please be sure to note that these fingerless mitts come without thumbs. I expected that, so while I prefer thumbs, that is not part of my review.<br /><br />The reason I deducted a star is that the fingers go higher in the picture then they do in real life. I have small hands, and they sit at the knuckle. They do not go up my fingers at all. I knew they would be smaller than most of the fingerless gloves I own, but I had expected them to cover at least the bottom edge of my fingers. The double knit warmth is what kept them at a high rating."
4.0,Fits pretty well if the arms are a little tight.
4.0,"Bought the white for my husband for a FL trip.  I bought his usual size, XL, per chart and it just fit.  We washed it when we returned from the trip and somehow got a stain on it during the wash.  We did not put the shirt in the dryer but air-dried it after trying to get rid of that stain.  Didn't get to iron it because the stain wouldn't come out. Since he loved the light and airy feel to the shirt he wanted another so I reordered a size up XXL which came and fit him how he wanted."
4.0,"I love the material, expensive looking. I've recently started wearing hats and it's a bit difficult to find stylish hats that fit my big head. I thought given the style it'd be forgiving but its a bit snug. I still wear it, however, even if it doesn't fit like in the picture."
4.0,"Wish it looked the same on me as it does on other people. It fit much higher on my waist and puffed out which made me look pregnant. It definitely did not run large like others are saying. I wish I would have ordered my regular size but seeing how high it sits, will probably return it either way. I would be better if it ‚Äúflared‚Äù at the hips and not the waist."
4.0,"Really like these shoes for my daughter. Not sure why they called this shoe &#34;red&#34; as there's not an ounce of red on it. (Hot pink, yes) and went by other reviews and ordered a size up and they fit fine that way."
4.0,I loved the material but was a little too big and didn't quite fit like i would have liked it. Overall it's really nice. I may order the red one at another date. ‚ù§
4.0,Works great. Scratches easily.
4.0,nice looking wears good
4.0,"Very confortable shades, fit well, pretty tight, no movement while biking."
4.0,"This is a super cute floral print maxi, perfect for fall. I love the bold large flower pattern, and the 3/4 sleeves have a great tie accent. The fabric is thin and slinky. Much slinkier than I had expected but still comfortable. I wear about a size 6 and the size medium dress feels slightly large on me but still looks good worn a little looser. There is also an elastic in the back for stretch which might suit someone who wears a size 8."
4.0,The leather material for this item seemed to be very high quality and the stiching around the belt seemed very precise.  I was just disappointed that the while i order the correct size it did not measure up to the size inidcated making it smaller than it was supposed to be and made it necessary to return.
4.0,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the small fit. I am 5'9"" and 140 lbs and the small is perfect. The zippers are so fun and the color is just the right amount blue. It's pretty accurate to the photos, but a bit more of a purply navy. I took off a star because the fabric is pretty thin - I prefer my tight skirts to be a bit thicker. Other than that, no regrets!"
4.0,"There was spotting from excess glue on the patch, but its a great cap none the less."
4.0,runs a bit small and the material is on the thin side
4.0,One glove was sewn at a slight angle and was difficult to keep it straight... still worked out great.
4.0,"Very flattering and material is good quality, runs small, definitely order up one size"
4.0,About 10% of them didn't work upon receiving the package. The kids loved them! Great as mini flashlights in a pinch too.
4.0,Fun inexpensive lingerie.  My Gal looks so darling and hot in this!
4.0,The dress is very beautiful !! Just not true to size bought a size bigger and was still small .
4.0,I needed to &#34;tighten' it a bit for high impact aerobics and running.  works well
4.0,"Works as it should. Would be happier if the alarm was a bit louder and the controls were a little more intuitive. Fits well, not too heavy, and the red accents look nice."
4.0,Abit smaller then you think but works amazingly
4.0,Fits my one year old perfectly! The pom poms are cute. Stinky odor out of the package but hand washed and air dried took care of it.
4.0,Was a big hit!!
4.0,"Came in fast and they are nice joggers, not thin at all. Recommended"
4.0,"Fits great! Just flimsy. When washing it, might want a clothes mesh bag or bra mesh bag to wash it in. I didn‚Äôt now I have a hole on the side at the bottom. And don‚Äôt have keys or heavy phone in the pocket, got a hole there too. But it was all done by my doing. It fits great and comfortable, and yes I‚Äôm planning to buy more!"
4.0,"I love the fact that, despite the reviews of the colors, it actually came out in the color I asked for. ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE is that I managed to scratch them somehow without even touching the lenses. But they're great!"
4.0,"I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on these earrings. They‚Äôre very cute. One thing that I dislike though is that it didn‚Äôt come with any sturdy earring backs ‚Äî just the tiny little rubber backs to hold the earrings to the card it comes on. Those irritate my ears. I wish it came with larger, sturdier earring backs considering they are a little heavier."
4.0,These glasses have a retro and classic look to them.  Super cute and stylish.
4.0,Nice skirts
4.0,I was so worried to order this because it didn‚Äôt have any reviews but it just came in the mail today (2 days early) and is very nice quality. Its straight and not shaped with a corner for the neck which is my only complaint (and why it‚Äôs 4 and not 5 stars) but overall very happy with what I got!
4.0,"Overall I really love how lightweight this top is, and I love the draping in the back. I do think this could be a half inch longer, or maybe even an inch. I worry that if I raise my arms in this top someone could see a sliver of my belly. But it is cute and I‚Äôm tempted to get it in a second color."
4.0,Bought it as a gift and it perfect
4.0,"It has an elastic band at the top, which is nice because it means it doesn't need garter straps to stay up, but it is a little tighter than I would have expected and so left marks on me. The color is exactly as pictured and I really like it, but I wish they were a little smoother feeling. Nothing big to detract from the product, but these little things are the reason this product gets 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Nice quality  sterling silver earrings. They are lightweight and nice and shiny.
4.0,It‚Äôs very cute! Mine is big though. I‚Äôm usually an XL-2x. I purchased an XL and it‚Äôs alittle big
4.0,I bought this for my daughter who is 5'10&#34;.  I was worried that it would not be long enough for her to feel covered when wearing it with leggings. I bought a 2x and hit her above mid thigh.
4.0,This leather bag is sturdy. The brown bison leather had a weathered look. It is divided into two zippered compartments. The black lining is water resistant. Capacity is decent. There is also a small exterior zippered pocket. The zippers are strong and run smoothly. It is sturdy and unisex.
4.0,"Used them for a Minion costume, will keep them to wear around."
4.0,"The shirt is very well made and comfortable -but as most people stated, it does run small. I got an extra large and was still a bit snug on me. The color is nice and the lettering is great. It was still worth it!"
4.0,Super cute and a fraction of the price you would pay at the parks - I saw them everywhere! Only complaint is that they swing open very easily.
4.0,"The earings fit nicely. The colors that come are the ones that are in the picture.<br /><br />Just a tip, make sure to look at the different sizes and look at a ruler to help determine if that's the size you want.<br /><br />The earrings feel pretty nice, although if I don't remember to remove them before sleeping the backs scratch my pillows. The black bag that comes with the product is pretty cool too."
4.0,"These fit my Alta HR well, were easy to change out, and are as advertised.  To note, the strap is longer than the one that comes with your Alta HR, so if you have small wrists, they may be too long.  Also, in the picture, the light one looks white, but it is not.  The description says gray, and it is a light gray, so they are described correctly.  I will likely buy more in other colors."
4.0,"First time I wore the shirt was cute and soft, however after the first wash it lost soft texture."
4.0,They look so cool with my foamposite's
4.0,"This is a nice cuff watchband, although I wish it were just a bit narrower. It would be real nice for a man's watch ..... just a bit wide for a woman's. (But I'm still going to use it!)"
4.0,It looks just like the picture i have not wore it yet but it looks great
4.0,My daughter loved it very delicate bit on the small size but she loved it
4.0,very cute.  runs a bit small...
4.0,Our almost 4 VERY ACTIVE/ATHLETIC 4 year old LOVED these shoes and so did we! For the price they were great but they didn‚Äôt last more than a few months before they both got a hole in the bottom by the toes.
4.0,"Purchased for my 3 granddaughters for Christmas, but only received 2. Very disappointed."
4.0,Good quality. Better than expected. Way more comfortable than the strap that came with the watch.
4.0,It's a nice wallet and this is the only company that sells it in red.  I was expecting it to be like older change purses but this is larger
4.0,The shirt was definitely cute however a size small fits a size US 8-10 in women or much like a medium.  Bought the green long sleeve for myself and the armpits went down to my sides. It fit my mom perfectly though... way more bustier than me! Fabric also seems a little sheer.
4.0,Cute PJ‚Äôs great fit. Nice and light and great for summer.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised to find that this lived up to all the hype from another website. Easily holds large bottle ( I use it for a pint bottle) My husband painted it with fabric paints and it improved the looks.  The strap is wide enough to be very comfortable and long enough for a tall person. Good quality material was used to make it.
4.0,I wear an 8.5 but this seemed more closer to 9.  Still wore them for beach and vacation and liked the bottom feel.
4.0,The small is just a tiny bit big.  The material is a nice weight and has just a little bit of stretch.  It looks good with a petticoat underneath to dress it up and flare it out just a little bit.
4.0,Love the color. runs small. I‚Äôm usually a small but ordered a medium bad on the measurements. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 130lbs and 27 waist. Other than that it is great. Really cute
4.0,I developed planter fasciitis and this is the first pair of shoes I bought. I can only wear them a couple hours at a time and my heels start hurting.  Inserts make them better‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt love them.  they sort of look like a corrective shoe which would be OK if they worked great. Not really for me but I‚Äôve worn them too much to return them .  So far the vionic walking shoe has helped my planter fasciitis more than any other shoe I have tried
4.0,Awesome fit and style. It‚Äôs my new comfy shirt and yet it‚Äôs dressy!
4.0,These pants are nice fit. I was happy to know that I could wear them.
4.0,"Nice watch, but color is not as advertised. I expected dark purple, it‚Äôs more like a lavender."
4.0,"This is a very durable well made piece, I am only giving it a 4star because it didn't fit me and It couldn't be adjusted. However it fit my daughter perfect, so it is still a great item. The skulls are super cute and it is just as pictured. Wish it had fit me better."
4.0,These are cute but the ears are smaller...more like a 3 inch.
4.0,Black quartz watch with stainless steel band.  This mens watch is very nice. It is a stainless steel metal band that has a clasp to adjust the band.  The dial is quartz movement and has silver hands. The face is white and the glass is very clear. The watch feels good on the wrist and is not too heavy. It did not pull arm hairs which is a big plus.  It looks nice with dress clothes and with casual outfits. Very nice mens watch.
4.0,"The dress fit great, but the zipper is a little stiff. The lining in the dress makes it warmer than I thought it would be. Still a keeper."
4.0,"Love the hat.  Bought it for my 2 1/2 month old granddaughter - based on the information about the size.  Still very large.  It is so darn cute, though, so we know she will grow into it."
4.0,"The print looks like its gonna fade, and the back P.F logo is off center, but it fits good, and feels nice."
4.0,It is cute but very see thru
4.0,Sizing is a bit weird. I ordered a large. The shoulders and arms were really tight and the bust was a tad bit tight. Waist was a great fit. The length went right above my knee. I ended up returning the dress but it is a very cute item.
4.0,Good quality for the price and true to size.
4.0,So nice i had to order 5 more for work.
4.0,The bag is great. My only real issues is that the straps broke a couple of times. Dont overstuff it either which is why I think the straps broke. also the straps are pink. I thought they were going to be black but it really isn't that much of a problem.
4.0,Okay but not my favorite.
4.0,I love the style and material. But they run big
4.0,The nose piece hurt my nose and leaves a mark on my face when I take the glasses off. It makes me not want to wear them if I know I'm going to see people. Cute style and great quality construction. Maybe it's just me.
4.0,It looks great. Not very warm
4.0,These are beautiful. A little heavy but not too bad. I love them!
4.0,"This beanie is exactly what I expected!  I wore it for a camping trip and it was very useful.  It was too bright while looking at people but for walking around in the dark and keeping my head warm, this is the thing to wear for sure. ;)"
4.0,relieved the tingling sensation in my hands while riding
4.0,The dress is pretty. The measurements are true. I went up one size and I probably should not have.<br />The dress does not have much stretch so it will be fine with the belt.
4.0,Would have liked 2 white colors rather than one. I do like the variety of colors & they are good quality.
4.0,Really pretty but should have went up a size
4.0,the mask is adequate but no fun to actually have to use
4.0,Love the design of the sport bra. Excellent material and construction for the price its awesome.
4.0,"I'm 5'5"", 145lbs, and 36DDD. I ordered a large, and it fits well at the waist. The chest fits because of the tie in the back, but it gapes a little bit around the arm pits."
4.0,"I received these pants through the Amazon Vine Voice program. They look well made, the fit is accurate by following the size chart provided, and I like the comfort as well.<br /><br />Fabric is thick enough, stitching is good, and I  feel the advertisement is accurate for these workout pants."
4.0,"Awesome tounge rings ,just need to make sure white dots are on most of them"
4.0,"I ordered this OURS Women‚Äôs Summer tank top for one of our daughters and she says that she likes the white color, the design of the V neck, the adjustable spaghetti strappy sleeveless and the styling of the big buttons and the button closure. Our daughter says she likes that this blouse fits her pretty well and she says the top is fashionable, lightweight, and comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as needed. She says that she likes the texture of the fabric is soft, smooth and gentle on her skin. She says she has been wearing it in the last several days and she says it matches most of her pants, jeans, shoes and fashion accessories.<br />Our daughter likes that this shirt appears to be made with good quality 96% polyester materials and it seems to be durable, stylish and breathable.  It appears to be good value for bucks, considering the quality and the price point. I would recommend it."
4.0,"The dress is somewhat bigger than I thought it would be but still fits nice enough for me. I already expected a slighty thinner material after reading some reviews but I don't feel this is an issue for me, no areas were like ""see through"" or anything but that could be since it is a little looser fitting. The dress is super comfy I'm glad I ordered two. For the pricei think it is a good deal. Only bad for me was seems to be a slight snag in the stitching on the green one I purchased but there isn't a hole or anything and I plan on wearing a cardigan anyway so for the price I'm fine with it."
4.0,Comfortable. These lightweight shoes are a lovely shade of blue. My mum has instep issues and the straps offer support. Will buy again
4.0,"Still didn't decided to keep it or not.The vest is very nice,beautiful gray color, well made. It fit me ok,but if I want to ware it close, I should move the hook around to achieve the perfect draping (right now if I close the vest ,the look is not flattering).But maybe I no need to go through all this adjustments, because I really like the vest open.Looks more fashionable, modern and chic when ware open with long pendant necklace. Fur is soft,vest feels comfortable. Can dress up simple black outfit for sure.There was not a lot of shedding, came with duster bag to keep it safe and clean inside.<br />UPDATE I decided to keep it. It's so beautiful, glad I didn't return it.Love it."
4.0,Just a little smaller than we expected but they fit - great product!
4.0,"Love this suit but it's too small everywhere. Boobs tend to want to escape either the sides if I get them pushed up enough or out the bottom if I get the cleavage right. I'm 5'8, about 150lbs and a 36 C/D cup, meaning I'm slightly more than a C but not quite a full D. Will probably try the next size bigger because it is a really cute suit."
4.0,I got this to go with my toddler's Ariel costume.  Yes it's cheap.  I don't need or expect it to last longer than Halloween week.  She loves it and it looks cute with her costume so that's good enough for me.
4.0,"FIT: I am pear shaped 5'8, 140lbs, B-cup and the medium fits perfectly. STYLE: The neckline is gorgeous, sleeves perfect, plaid lovely. My only observation is that the plaid is red and navy based but the buttons are black. This made me a little crazy so I purchased buttons to replace these. Also, the last set of buttons sit a little too close to the belt in my opinion so I will adjust that when I put on the new buttons. As you can see, I am ridiculously picky but still happy with this dress and keeping her!"
4.0,Love this product but I wish it came in different colors.
4.0,Good jacket ! Decent price !
4.0,"Great for lounging around the house and wearing it loosely<br /><br />Not recommended for when you do a lot of physical activities or sports.<br /><br />Wearing them with tight fit or athletic shoes can be uncomfortable<br /><br />Some pairs have some loose threads. Once you snip them off, they work just fine<br /><br />Length wise, cross between crew and ankle socks<br /><br />Very nice patterns, some have a very festive look to them"
4.0,"This corset was offered to me for free to test and review. I'm a corset wearer and also a historical docent. Corsets are a particular passion of mine and over the years I have come to understand quality.<br /><br />This is a cute corset for casual wear. It has heavy boning and will help snug you in and give you a rigid posture and good silhouette. What it won't do is work for waist training unless you are doing it casually.<br /><br />The laces are ribbons. Literally ribbons. On the sample sent to me, the top ribbon has a knot tied in it to hold the halves together. That means little tensile strength. These will lace you up to a point, but will snap if truly cinched down. Perhaps they will hold up for 5-10 wearings, maybe even 20, but at some point, they are going to fail. They will also stretch a bit while being worn.<br /><br />This corset is a fantasy style for the lady or gent who wishes gentle compression. The boning is not strong enough to take on a true compression job. Even careful acclimating the corset to your body temperature, progressively tightening in states, etc... Will not save this corset. It is an inexpensive but well made &#34;look cute&#34; corset.<br /><br />As long as you use it gently, it will last for a year or more. No tight lacing. Snug is fine, don't try for body modification with this one. If you are small waisted, you will achieve an hourglass, if you are larger, you will achieve a smoother and slightly flatter silhouette, less pronounced in the hourglass design.<br /><br />It is a beautiful corset and well made with bones designed to hold your body snugly. Please do not buy this in a size 4-5 inches less than your natural waist size unless you have already begun waist training, or you will find it too tight and too confining. You might not even be able to get it fastened without a huge gap in the back.<br /><br />There is a modesty panel sewn in that helps keep your skin from being ribbon burned but you can leave it open to show skin if preferred. Be aware that a corset with this type of boning is tight even when sized to fit your natural waist. You will be held rigidly. You might even have a back ache after wearing it due to your new upright and stiffened posture. (This goes away in a few minutes in most cases.)<br /><br />This is well sewn and the bones are not likely to pop through the fabric unless you tighten it too firmly. (Metal bones can also be damaged by being stressed.) If the bones are breaking down or your material is puckering, you are tightening it too much. If there is no space in the back after tightening or more than two inches gap,no up or down accordingly."
4.0,Great addition for my Great Gatsby event.  Kept me warm. Good quality material. would have gave 5 stars by the clip to hold it shut is a pain.
4.0,The fabric was not as good quality as expected. The color was as depicted in the ad.
4.0,"This swimsuit fits wonderfully and is very flattering. I wish the top came a little closer to the bottoms, but it is not a real issue. The material is very comfortable."
4.0,"This was a little short on the sides and I am 5""2'!!!"
4.0,Some if the stitching came undone
4.0,Material is lighter than i expected but beautiful color and great design
4.0,It's a fun easy belt to add a pop of color or to add a waist to a cute outfit/dress.  I have gotten several compliments.
4.0,Love them. So comfy and warm. Die came off on my legs but easily came off in the shower.
4.0,"My only issue is that the glasses seem like they are going to break whenever I just open them enough to put on. But they are cheap, so I dont expect much. They are really cute."
4.0,"Runs a little small, but good quality. Did not fit my body shape as hoped though so will probably return. Worth a shot to others as material and stretch are great. Shipping was pretty fast."
4.0,It was a Little thick than expected that's the only thing but other than that my Boyfriend loves it. I bought this for valentines day because he's an alpha and he loved it.
4.0,I purchased these glasses because I loved the idea of one pair of glasses with multiple lens to use. I have used the polarized glasses which are great for driving and riding in the sun. The yellow tint glasses are great for driving at night helps with headlight glare. The clear works great for cutting grass and riding the bike when I want to protect my eyes. Haven't found a use for the blue tint yet. Fit great on my face I hate tight glasses. Overall good product. Wish they would include something to explain the different lens.
4.0,"Larger than I expected. Still, looks great on, though."
4.0,"I ordered an XL the first time and returned it for large. Much better for me in large. I'm usually a 10/12 large, 36-38D. I thought XL would work and not cling to my tummy. But was too big and droopy looking. The large fits great. It's fun and cute. Flattering in back. Not too clingy in front on the tummy. Fabric is nice and cool. Will be cute with a sports bra for the gym or even to wear this top with pretty bra or bralette under, with skinny jeans. I reordered in more colors after I switched to the large."
4.0,The band looks like it will fit. The pins were missing. You have stated they are in the mail. Thanks.
4.0,It is just right!
4.0,"I love the material - look and feel - however the fit is a bit small. I ordered a 3x even though the fit of a 2x is perfect with other brands. Still, I received several compliments that it looked nice üòä"
4.0,Great product. Cleans very well.
4.0,"He really likes them. I read other reviews regarding sizing before I ordered. They were a gift, but received positive feedback from my daughter."
4.0,I bought these t shirts as a birthday present for my 5 year old granddaughter who loves Sofia the First.  They are very cute and look good on her.  She is on a smaller side so they fit her well.  They might be too small for an average 5 year old.  She will probably grow out of them in 3 or 4 months.  That‚Äôs why 4 stars.
4.0,"This actually looked really good on. Cheaply made so you really only get 2 or 3 wears out of it, but that's just part of buying something at this cost."
4.0,"Bought these for myself, I liked the sizes, they wear well, only thing (for me) is that they are hard to hook to together. Very nice!"
4.0,"These scarfs are so cute and such a great price but beware, they like to shed quite a bit."
4.0,"I have a bigger head, especially from the weight gain, so that may be the issue. I live the look‚Ä¶wearing anyway!"
4.0,I was a bit disappointed in the crinkle of the leather. There are wrinkles on the bottom of the bag that are distracting from how cute it could be
4.0,"Super cute and adorable!  Great way to keep my piercings from closing up.  My only issue is, the prongs have gotten caught in sweaters and today I find one of the earrings is missing entirely after getting caught on who knows what.  :("
4.0,"This graphics are great and construction of the pajamas is adequate.  That said, these pajamas fit more like a Size 4T as opposed to a Size 4.<br /><br />Our little boy loves them."
4.0,I really liked the material and the fit. The color is more of a bright highlighter yellow instead of a fall looking mustard yellow. Still cute though.
4.0,I like the shape of these trays. Just one problem...the teardrop cabachans were too small for the trays. I received 20mm cabachans and the trays are 30mm.
4.0,"These glasses are lightweight and comfortable. They are a little small so if you have a wide head, these aren't for you. Comes with case and bag and cleaning cloth."
4.0,Not your typical gator. It is thick. Which is good. Im a big person and these are kind of baggy. They fall off my nose.
4.0,"Cute necklace and gave me the look I was going for. My only dislike is the length around the neck is kind of small, felt like it was more for a child's neck. I had to clip the necklace at the last hole on the chain link."
4.0,The shirts arrived individually packaged. It fit perfectly. The lace pocket is such a cute detail and the material was pretty comfortable. Not cheap looking. One of the shirts was sewn a bit crooked so the lines weren‚Äôt straight.
4.0,My husband loves them! I purchased for him to add more mental security to him going out during these times.
4.0,"These gloves fit, but are a bit too snug.  And the fleece is thin.  If washed, they would shrink and be too small, but they are nice as extra gloves when needed."
4.0,"nice quality, but a few loose strings. I don't have any fraying yet, so fingers crossed."
4.0,It didn‚Äôt come in a larger size (XLG)
4.0,Nice simple blouse
4.0,"Bought this for my baby girl's first Halloween aviator costume.  First one that was shipped came defective and damaged due to poor controls at manufacturer.  Contacted Amazon Support and they had another one rushed out to get here the day before Halloween.  Second one was much better and the only thing my wife didn't like about it was that goggles flipped backward too easily, but that is minor in my opinion.<br /><br />It even fit (though snugly) over our baby's Docband (medical device) on her head."
4.0,Love the bottoms‚Ä¶very slimming.  The top looks nice but a little itchy and little support.
4.0,Great sun protection when extended time out in the sun.
4.0,"The glasses are quite big. I didn't pay attention to the measurements offered, however they're not too big and I like the bodaciousness  of them."
4.0,The sandals were cool and had adjustable straps to help keep them on your feet. they also have two pairs of socks. but when i opened the packaged the sandals reeked of some nasty smell. i left them out for a bit hopefully get rid of the smell.
4.0,I ordered these for my bridesmaids... Beautiful!!!
4.0,I‚Äôm a size 3 in all my shoes. I got a 3 in this and they are about a half inch too short.
4.0,"When I came to purchase this swim suit initially there was only 1 review and it said that the suit ran about 2 sizes too small (she'd mentioned that the 6T fit like a 4T). So I ordered a 4T for my daughter who will be 2 in one week. Upon receipt of the suit, I found that it actually fits very true to size (so, much too large for my daughter). I have a son who is a 4T and it looks like the perfect size for him.<br />The swimming cap does fit my daughter perfectly now, so I‚Äôd say those run quite small. It wouldn‚Äôt come close to fitting my son‚Äôs big head. But we probably won‚Äôt really use the swimming cap. It‚Äôs just a cute accessory to have.<br />The suit is well sewn (no loose threads, etc) and the material is great. Honestly, it‚Äôs much higher quality than I expected it to be. I love the design, with the cute cut out in the back. And the leopard print is adorable.<br />I didn‚Äôt notice before purchasing, however, that it is ‚Äúbedazzled‚Äù on the front (you can slightly see this in the 4th photo on the listing). It says ‚ÄúBeach Baby‚Äù and has a butterfly in little rhinestones. I think it would be WAY cuter without this, especially since mine is just slightly off center which annoys me.<br />The rhinestones aren‚Äôt super noticeable, but I would have gone with another suit if I‚Äôd seen them initially. But I‚Äôm still excited to hang on to this suit until it fits. I‚Äôm sure my daughter will get plenty of use from it.<br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I hope that my review has helped you in your decision to purchase this product."
4.0,A little small for the size chart shure keep head warm in below zero weather and gets to -25 where I live
4.0,I like them but it seats a bit too high in the sneakers
4.0,"As described. However it seems like after a little wear and tear it might not hold up, but it could prove me wrong.<br /><br />To my fellow small wrist people: It is on the very last hole upon opening so I will probably have to make new holes as I wear it. Food for thought before purchasing."
4.0,"Just had my third baby and needed to get some new nursing bras as my old ones were so worn out they looked more like saddle bags.  I got these because the price was right and they looked comfy. Because of the price u didn't have my hopes to high.  I was presently suprised.<br />Pro's: They're very soft,  great coverage,  easy access to the clasp when feeding, the pad in the cup is removable and a good size, comfy enough to sleep in<br />Cons: the pad in the cup bunches up when folding the flap down for feeding. This is easy enough to to readjust. It's just annoying. (Why I took a star)<br />Runs a bit large. Although I maybe I lost weight and am in a smaller size now. (One could how right?)"
4.0,"Cute top, well made. Only issue is the ties could be a bit longer."
4.0,Smaller than expected.... Gave to little sister
4.0,"Pros: SUPER cute design (my son loves the moos), very warm & no fade or shrink after several washes<br />Cons: legs are super short while arms are super long (almost like they flipped the measurements), no zipper cover at neck. It has extra material, but it isn‚Äôt an actual cover.<br />For the price I‚Äôm happy with it"
4.0,I love it but it is al least 1 size too small.
4.0,"This seems to be well made, made like any tie."
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend.  He likes it.  My only issue with it is, the customized stitching looks rushed."
4.0,My daughter loves the tights however didn‚Äôt like that A different pattern showed up than tmwhat she wanted
4.0,"I like the size of this bandana. I mostly use it around my neck to keep it warm in cooler weather.<br />I liked these bandanas so well, I bought another 3 pk."
4.0,there are ok
4.0,Quality made. Worth the price. Not all 5 pairs fit quite the same though.
4.0,"The shirt is as stated -- which I didn't read carefully enough!  I didn't realize that it has open shoulders so was disappointed in that.  The pic doesn't really show that and that's what I was looking at.  I even bought a purple one because I was excited to see Style & Company in my size on Amazon and at such a good price.  The material IS heavier like a thermal shirt and well worth the price but just beware, it's open shouldered!  It's in style but I'm not! lol"
4.0,Better than expected!  It's been hot here and the dress felt great. I like the high/low front too. Pretty happy with it for $20.
4.0,"Great set and does keep your warm which I was worried about because of the thickness.  I dropped a star because it was a little stretched out by the end of the day, but with one washing it was back in shape."
4.0,"I ordered this bag to pack with some emergency prep stuff as a &#34;just in case&#34; for winter travel. We live in the country and it's a good distance to town so winters with kids in the car can get interesting. Was very pleased with the quality of this bag. Especially when compared to other much more expensive brands, they are virtually the same! Bag is of good size for my 5'6&#34; frame. It holds a TON of stuff, and has nice pockets, clips, expandable cord, etc. Shoulder straps are slightly padded and it can buckle across the chest. I love the exterior access pockets. I do wish maybe they were configured a bit better like some other styles, where you can move things and velcro them on/off. Still, for the quality and price I am very happy. I've squeezed a whole pack of granola bars, nuts, several bottles of water, a blanket, heat blanket, heat pads, a first aid kit, flashlight, spare batteries, lighter, lighter fluid, scissors, weather radio, and more into it and it's not full yet!"
4.0,knit cuffs width is great and its elasticity is good.<br />level of pockets is slightly low.<br />no shipping to my country.
4.0,"Really great fitting one piece!  I bought a different long sleeved swimsuit recently from a store and it wasn‚Äôt great‚Äîthe chest area seemed unfitted and like it would float around, but this swimsuit rocks those areas! The fit is great, from the hip openings to the chest construction in the swimsuit. There are soft padded cups that are removable. The zipper closes securely and even has a fabric cover so it doesn‚Äôt scratch your neck at all. The quality of fabrics and stitching feels really well made and comparable to any swimsuit you‚Äôd find at the store, so for this price, it‚Äôs a double win!<br /><br />The only reason I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars if because I wish the design was a little more flattering. For this swimsuit, the diamond shaped stripe fabric on the sides is cute, but I wish the striped fabric actually extended a little broader over the hips. The top is super cute, but the layout of the fabrics makes your hips/belly look wider instead of being slimming."
4.0,"I work in a facility with metal detectors, and love that I have found such a cute watch that doesn't have a metal band.  I was concerned  about the blue not being as pretty as it is in the picture, but it is just as pretty."
4.0,"Love them!!<br />Little tight but probably for other people are as they expected. After a day of work or returning home to a restful time, they are the perfect thing just for hanging around."
4.0,Perfect for everyday wear
4.0,"This was my Kentucky Derby Hat.  It is a cute hat, but the brim was larger and heavier than I had anticipated.  i was annoyed at the loss of my peripheral vision all day. Arrived on time, nice packaging."
4.0,"These sunglasses seem to follow the current fashion trend as everything comes back eventually. There is no floral pattern. It's really more like a mosaic stained glass window. I'm not a fan of gold so the added gold embellishments I don't appreciate. I'd prefer not to have them at all. I would also consider these glasses more 70's than 80's. I grew up in that era. The lenses themselves could be a bit darker as well. I do like the case, the screwdriver key chain and the cleaning cloth. Nice touch. I was provided a sample to try and test as a consumer to provide my honest opinion. I think they're cute for the 20-30 something age group. I'll be gifting them to my daughter for Mothers Day. I know that she'll love them."
4.0,poorly made.  poked my finger and turned it green within hours.  oh well it was cheap
4.0,Arrived as promised.  The masks are very comfortable and totally block out the light. The only problem is if you are a restless sleeper the mask may come off during the night.
4.0,"Stylish & beautiful shoe! True to size. Great for a special occasion, but not comfy enough if you plan on doing a lot of walking."
4.0,Smaller than expexted....will require me to air dry it not to shrink
4.0,Great looking hat well made. Many thanks.
4.0,"The colors are pretty but they are a little warmer to wear than advertised.  They do wash a little softer than when you get them but aren't totally soft, if that makes sense. I bought mainly for the different colors and the colors don't disappoint. Not sure I would use these in summer when it is hot."
4.0,"I will try to lose some inches on my waist, the color and style is beautiful and keeps the chill away!"
4.0,It wasn't totally mine size. It runs a little big. But the fabric feels Nice.
4.0,I love them just a bit to big!
4.0,"This chain is pretty, looks nice and arrived on time. I would recommend this chain to everyone, Best as a gift or gesture for that special one. The price is reasonable, and can suit everyone."
4.0,"The leather is a little thin, but it works for wht i needed it for"
4.0,I returned this pretty dress coz it doesn't fit on me. I'm always a size small.
4.0,Nice socks. Haven't used them much and have only washed one time. Very little shrinkage. Foot padding is excellent.
4.0,"They're very awesome, and great for the price. I gave 4 stars because they arrived with a small scratch on them."
4.0,Hurt a bit trying to put over my ear but omce on was very comfortable
4.0,"Absolutely love the shorts, fabric is comfortable, and sleek! Fit is on point, out of the other colors this one fits the best and looks the best"
4.0,Easy to adjust and fasten
4.0,Love the look but there a 12 in shaft not a 13 in as mentioned in the description.  But are beautiful.  Never own cowboy boots before and it seem like one is wider that the other? Maybe I need to ware them in a little. Lol
4.0,Looks beautiful. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the description said the value was more and this was an incredible deal. It's worth what I paid for. My wife likes them.
4.0,"This shirt is super cute but the neckline is sloppy, its uneven in a spot like it was hand cut and the person messed up and its very frayed. I trimmed it up a bit to make it look better and its not really noticeable now. Otherwise the shirt is great"
4.0,"Like it VERY MUCH! My 1st one broke, can't adjust or bend it too much, but I actually bought 2 more. It goes well with all my other elephant attire! üêò üêò üêò üêò üêò üêò üêò üòé"
4.0,Really cute dress. Fits as expected.
4.0,Cool tank top for a great price.
4.0,"Its a good fit. Needs a bandu or bralette underneath, which I like. Otherwise side boob. I got the purple one and the design is white, not pink as shown in the photo.  Overall a good purchase and I will wear a lot."
4.0,The sleeves keep flapping up but I'm sure an iron will solve the problem
4.0,"Arrived on time and as described, thank you!"
4.0,Seems like a sturdy purse and I love that the zippers lock.
4.0,I have bought the same brand and style of shirt previously. The material is a good weight and quality. I will buy more of these shirts.
4.0,Very cute. Just really big.
4.0,"Although the stones in the earrings themselves were nice and sparkly, the stones themselves were barely colored at all.  I ordered Alexandrite and the color was barely noticeable so that they looked grey with a hint of lavender.  Too bad, because the earrings seemed to be a good quality.  I ordered the 8 mm and they were quite large.  I'd probably love them in a different color."
4.0,Exelente compr√°
4.0,Cute and works well like all other Flipeez hats. Only downside is the batman one fits smaller than normal. We have 5 different designs and this one is not true to size.
4.0,"love the purse, actually thought it was larger than it is but I can live with it. The only concern I have is that the chains keep slipping constantly, if I try to wear it w/the double handles, one of the chains inevitably  extends & falls off my shoulder and it looks like a cross body.  I was thinking of using plastic ties to hold them in place. Would appreciate any other ideas."
4.0,I really like these shorts‚Ä¶but they don‚Äôt have a liner/brief in them so I only gave them 4 stars. They have a tendency to ride up a lot too- but that could just be me.
4.0,Nice gloves but I have small hands and they are too big
4.0,"It's warm, soft and cozy which is everything I wanted but really needs just one button to keep it closed."
4.0,"I love the jeans, but going by the reviews I should of order 2sizes up,very nice jeans but wished I world have known to 2size up not one,the waste is smaller,looks like I'm going to lose a lil bellyüò©"
4.0,"the fabric could be a little better because its a little to clear, but the shirt fits perfectly and the logo is bright and colorful. Have gotten many compliments for it too. a great buy for sure"
4.0,"I like this a lot - flattering and comfortable.  My only complaint is that it is really see through.  I was hoping I could wear it as a dress and a cover up, but I don't foresee that happening due to its' transparency.  Also, the slit comes up very high, so when you sit down it exposes you easily!"
4.0,"I sized up on this and it was still a little snug. I bought several from another maker but they didn't have this green. Needless to say, I'll wear it, but maybe not as much as the others."
4.0,This is a very pretty dress but with issues. The top portion is a beautiful lace. The bottom portion however is taffeta I would have liked it better if it was cotton or polyester. The taffeta is very heavy and makes it too dressy and a bit little girl looking. It seems like it's to hot for summer and the lace part is too cold for winter.
4.0,"I'm 5'10, 175 lbs, pretty athletic build with a true 34 inch waist (not like I wear ""34"" jeans, like wrap a tape measure around my waist '34""), which according to the sizing listed, would be a US Large.  Based on complaints about sizing, I went with an XL...  Mistake...  Although the shorts ""fit"", the inner liner wasn't snug at all, couldn't imagine running with a phone in the inner pocket, it would be bouncing all around...  I returned the US XL, and actually bought the US M, I wanted the inner lining snug so my phone wouldn't bounce around.  When I tried them on, the waist fit, length was good (basically about an inch or so above my knee), and the inner lining was semi-snug, but certainly not super snug (I'd probably prefer a bit snugger, but whatever).  Now, I have a bit of a butt, and I do feel like these shorts weren't cut to accommodate that, perhaps it was designed for a more international market, so the pockets pull a bit to because of that.  Long story short, shorts sizing is pretty good (based on accurate measurements, not what size your jeans are - I typically wear 32"" inch jeans despite my 34"" waist, because companies all lie about true sizing...), but be aware of the cut.  These shorts are not nearly as perfect as my Brooks 2-1 running shorts, but at $15 instead of $55, they are pretty good.  I work out often, needed a couple of extra pairs of shorts and didn't want to drop another $100-150, so here we are.  If you aren't looking for perfect, but pretty good, for $15 these shorts aren't bad..."
4.0,This would have been 5 stars if it wasn't so dang small!! I'm not a XXL but I had to return my XL and I hope the XXL will fit. I'm usually a size 12 (which is an XL most of the time) great quality product though so which is why im giving this 4 stars!
4.0,I like them but I wish they were a perfect square.  The fabric feels lovely and I will use them as planned.
4.0,"I loved the bag but most of all the big bow, what I liked least was did it did not bring a dust bag for when I don t use it. üòî"
4.0,Very elegant dress. I wish I got a size larger because it does bunch a bit in the tummy area which is annoying. Overall great dress though. There are these little rubber things on the shoulder area so the dress doesn't slip and that's awesome!
4.0,"Breathe easy, would be better if it blacked out one's face more though."
4.0,Top fit a little big but the outfit overall is cute
4.0,Looks as pictured. Very lightweight!
4.0,I really liked this swimsuit when I first saw it! Still love it on! The top is my favorite part the bottoms I will probably switch out with a different pair. Top has straps so you can adjust it. I normal wear a large but ordered a 2X and it fits the same as a large!
4.0,Cute and nice for the price.
4.0,He likes it and said it seems like a good quality.
4.0,Pretty.stone is lovely. Light colored. The chain is too short though. And very thin.
4.0,"I ordered the large and it works if all you want is to wear it right at your wrist bone.  But if you need to move up your arm for a workout, it‚Äôs not long enough.  The band is stiff, but still comfortable.  The underneath padding feels weird to me, but not bad and it does help with venting.  Overall, not bad looking and it seems like real leather."
4.0,Purchased for my upcoming shoulder surgeries. The fabric is super soft. I ordered a medium but would have been ok with a small. Not a big deal as I‚Äôm looking for comfort and functionality.
4.0,"So far so good ish....I like the adjustability and mechanical design, poles held up well to a 2200 vert ft, 8 mile rd trip hike on some craggy reasonably challenging terrain. However, one of the small baskets checked out and fell off, cracked right down the radius, but who cares. We'll see how they hold up over time. They're light weight and are decently balanced and the cork kept grip when it was completely soaked, but that's what cork is for! They break down easily and adjust on the fly for angle of terrain. Only didn't receive a 5/5 because the basket broke off, I wasn't being ginger with them but I also wasn't being careless either!"
4.0,Keeps keys for sliding out
4.0,Really great quality. Just wish it were a little longer under the chin for more protection.
4.0,"I would have given these shoes five stars if the lining was able to be removed.  That way my daughter could wear them on a hot day or a cold day.  On hot days her feet sweat.  I have a pair of Crocs with lining, for adults, and the lining is attached with buttons.  Easy to remove.  I just assumed these would be the same."
4.0,Fits well. Looks cute and not too expensive.
4.0,"So I have mixed feelings.. I've worn tank tops under my shirts since middle school.. I'm 28 now and work in an accounting office.. I still found a way to wear tanks under my clothes and still look professional. I have 20 tanks right now, these included. I absolutely LOVE the length of these. The fabric is thin but I like that.. they look great under anything and do not bulk up. Literally my only ONE quarrel against them is the little round piece of plastic that holds the strap to the back on the tank.. it's not sewn on one end of the straps and my first time taking it off.. it flew off.. Luckily I was able to get it back on and now I'm just super cautious when putting them on and taking them off. Other than that I love em."
4.0,"Like very much and love the hinge which made it very easy to put on. However, it was difficult to snap close."
4.0,"I really love the look of this bathing suit.  No it did not fit but I kind of expected that.  The top part was quite a bit too small but since the torso was long (which is a nice change) I did some adjustments adding a bra of my own, it turned out great.  The cost of the suit was not so much that making these adjustments and adding things made it worth my while."
4.0,"UPDATE: Immediately after posting a rather displeased review on the quality of these clips, I was contacted by the seller's customer service representative. Yoshan's customer service is superb and their willingness to resend the product in efforts to ensure a quality service is admirable.<br /><br />They receive 4 stars due to diligence to remedy the situation and superb customer service.<br /><br />As for the product it self, it should be noted that there is indeed a black powdery residue on the inside of the clips. They may be a bit difficult to open and close. The clips come in different designs and with small silicone rubber stoppers as well. While I am extremely grateful with Yoshans professionalism, I must admit I was not a fan of the product."
4.0,Very cool looking and warm for what you pay it's definately worth it
4.0,"A little thinner than I hoped for, but cute top. Fit as expected."
4.0,band is a little tight...will have to put an extender in for more comfort.
4.0,Love this product. The quality of the leather and the lactic bands that you use to safely place your yoga book with out scratching it. Just full time awesome. It also came on time.
4.0,"I really like the way these fill on my skin.  Almost like you do not have them on.  I gave 4 stars , because the cuff at the bottom is a little too large for my ankles.  Consequently, it rides up my legs during the night when I sleep."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I'm usually a medium but I got a large because I wanted an oversized look. I like the fit. For reference, I'm 5'6 tall, 155 lbs, 36C in chest, 30"" waist, 40"" hips, thick thighs and booty. I took off one star because of the material,it's so wrinkly and it doesn't have pockets üòë not that I ever put anything in there but I just like dresses with pockets ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4.0,The tot really likes it.
4.0,Looked good‚ÄîI‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù wearing medium<br />A bit see through but not bad
4.0,Beautiful but size up so that the waistband fits comfortable after you eat ;)
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty. It would be nice if the neck hole is bigger. It‚Äôs a struggle to put it in.
4.0,One of the snaps was broken when I received it but I can work around it. There are a few improvements I would recommend but it's a useful gym bag.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. Heavy weight material, the lining is well made. I'm 5'5 and 230lbs. I got a XXL  and it fits like a glove and hit just below my knees. Only complaint is the arms a bit tight but I have biggish arms so if you have fat arms, be ready for that. The color is beautiful. Will buy again."
4.0,"I am normally a Large, I ordered an x-Large then washed it and it is about right."
4.0,"I love Jessica Simpson purse. They are durable, beautiful, and very well made!"
4.0,Love it! üíõ
4.0,"Cool, definitely a conversation starter"
4.0,"I like it very much, it is the right size and not bulky, it does not interfere with the keys."
4.0,Used for cataract surgery
4.0,It's pretty good for a cheap hat.
4.0,"This is light weight and a easy addition to the rotation. The 5 is true to size, and will not shrink once dried!"
4.0,"They are nice but when I ordered 2 sets of 6 I received 8 Black and 4 Red, they were supposed to be all Black, and 1 of the red ones the top comes off too easy. I emailed the Seller and they took care of the problem immediately."
4.0,"Quick transaction; fast shipping; runs a-bit large, smelled chemical-ish, but nothing a couple hot washes couldn't fix. Graphic looks great! Thanks again."
4.0,Somewhat small. I am an 8 so I got large which is for 8-9. They are good as long as I don't have socks on as well. Seem very well made. Definitely keeping them. It would order larger size next time.
4.0,I really like this dress.  Not only is it sexy but I received compliments all night at my office Christmas party. I'm only rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because the back of the dress was a little gappy  (not a word but it works for this situation) and the inside slip kept riding up. Otherwise I'm keeping it and i'll definitely wear it again.
4.0,Love the product- work in a hospital operating room and get very cold. The sizing was surprising. I usually wear a mens‚Äôs medium or women‚Äôs large. This item is like a women‚Äôs medium size. Okay for me as I only wear it under a cover jacket
4.0,"The hat is nice,good quality but runs a little big. My husband has multiple new era hats all same size 7 5/8 could of went down one size with this one"
4.0,"This dress was beautiful for the price but the zipper is terrible. My very strong father could not get it to zip all the way. IÔ∏è had to put it on backwards, zip then pray IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt gonna R.I.P. it turning it around on my body. IÔ∏è needed this for a black tie wedding and it was perfect. Runs small as IÔ∏è ordered a 14 (my normal size) and it was tight but bearable for the wedding with spanx. This dress is also very long as IÔ∏èm 5‚Äô10 and in heels it was still dragging the ground. IÔ∏è prefer a longer gown so IÔ∏è was fine with this. Loved the sleeves and got many compliments"
4.0,"Wish there was asian or Teen sizing for us ladies under 5'2&#34;.  It pops up and I keep having to adjust it.  The material is amazing and it has gorgeous color and print.  Wearing mostly under my ski helmet, so its a keeper."
4.0,A little snug and I ordered a size up. Like the material
4.0,Ordered 2 sizes larger - 42 instead of 38 - but should've ordered 3 sizes larger.  Cup size fit as expected.  I would order this again depending on how it holds up after I wear it and wash it.
4.0,The fabric is light so they didn't automatically make my five year olds face hot. He was also excited to wear them because of the designs. I also like that these have multiple uses and can be worn around the neck to help keep him from losing them. I would recommend.
4.0,Cute little shoes.  Very flexible.  Not too tight & not to loose.  Cute little baby shower gift or use them as an accent on gift instead of bow.  Adorable!! Bought these at a discount for an unbiased review.
4.0,Great shoes quality and so cute. Only issue is they run a bit big. My 3 yr old says they are very comfortable.
4.0,My 4 yr old loves these boots. They are great for winter and muddy weather!
4.0,Good winter boot for that price. Kind of wide in a way.
4.0,"I am surprisingly in great like with this bra.  It is lightweight, has elasticized mesh-like sides and is truly smooth underneath every version of dress and tshirt I have worn it under.  The fit is comfortable, I was a bit worried because the clasp is thin and for 34 DD the clasps are usually wider to provide more support.  This bra has good lift, support, and clean lines.  Nothing pinches or fits uncomfortably in any area which is also a plus."
4.0,We were traveling to Alaska and the Pacific Northwest and needed something to keep us dry when hiking in the rainforests.  These raincoats really fit the bill!  They fall below the knee so they kept almost our entire bodies dry.  I only wish they had a side pocket or even some kind of pocket with a flap on the outside to put my phone or to keep my hands dry.  But overall very well pleased with these raincoats - they are well worth the money!
4.0,Te collar was a bit too big but fits well otherwise
4.0,"Tells time and date, is sort of light and has a cheaper feel to it, but it looks nice. I mean what do you expect you're only paying $20.  Also when the band hits the case it's sort of a loud hollow sound. Overall great watch for the price"
4.0,I have a big bust (DDD) but I still found this to be too big on the top. The bottoms fit perfectly and I can make the top work if I tie it really tight
4.0,I was disappointed to find out hat the length of the sock had changed (was longer and skinnier) as had the material the socks were made of (there was more cotton before).<br />I have ordered 4 pair of these socks and I do not like the new pair nearly as much as the older ones.  I won't be ordering anymore.
4.0,"good graphics , quality is decent"
4.0,"Nice quality shirt. Bought it for my fair skinned son for the summer in Miami. It's hot out here, so I needed something that was really light weight but could cover him up so he doesn't burn outside. This worked out well.<br /> I originally ordered a 2T, since he was exactly 24 months old, but it was way too small, I couldn't even get it over his head. He is in the 10% percentile weight, so this was surprising, the 3T worked out perfect though."
4.0,good  quality
4.0,"Russell brand has always been well known and well made in my opinion. Lasts a long time if you treat it right, which is easy! Cuz it‚Äôs machine washable and doesn‚Äôt warp or shrink or anything with wear and washings. It fits well, so order your usual! This brand is one that has big and large sizes. Like large large! I recommend!"
4.0,"The first one that I ordered was defective. I emailed the company and they had a replacement in the mail in 48 hours.<br /><br />I love the feel of this band. I would say it's a little bit softer than the OEM, but barely. It is a little bit harder to get on and off than OEM.<br /><br />The blue band looks fantastic with the black watch.<br /><br />I've given it 4-5 stars for the slightly harder to attach/detach."
4.0,"Great feel, perfect for early season"
4.0,So my mom was going through my amazon and came across this dress. She was a bit skeptical about the sleeves in particular but nonetheless she wanted it. She received the dress and she was amazed by how it fits. She loved it! Only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the bottom fits a bit too wide for her liking. But it can be fixed! Overall I personally love it
4.0,"They are comfortable. For the price, I expected a better material. At least it has pockets."
4.0,I love this strap but if you have a smaller camera (I have Sony a600) I may recommend a different one. The strap is on the heavier side and feels weird that the camera weighs less than the strap itself. I love the 2 extra pockets and safety clip.
4.0,Not bad for the price. Simple and fits well
4.0,Very simple but cute. Absolutely love it!
4.0,"I love these slipper socks<br />They are warm, comphy. Only one problem, the top area of sock is so tight, difficult to get on but once on they are great. They also leave shedding of wool wherever you step.<br />Even though I still love them. I am happy with the design."
4.0,It‚Äôs nice and soft.  I like how it fits.
4.0,Shipping took a long time and was then delayed another four days. However it is a great mask. My hubby loves it. Fits perfectly and is exactly as pictured.
4.0,THE ARMS WERE TOO TIGHT.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DIDN'T FIT.
4.0,Useful in crochet items
4.0,Super comfortable.  Perfect weight and length for layering.
4.0,Fresh and confortable
4.0,I was a little disappointed with the material
4.0,"Base on the reviews we read before making the purchase, we ordered one size bigger than what my daughter usually wears and it fitted perfectly. She is happy with the hoodie. The quality is ok, its polyester. Colors do no fade."
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my grandmother's funeral. The dress is beautiful and I received many compliments. The sleeves are particularly lovely and more detailed than I expected. The belt divides the dress well and I rather like the buckle. The cut is very modest and appropriate for formal wear.<br /><br /> I ordered a medium and found it to be a nice fit with a bit of extra room, which made the dress very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. I'm 5'6, 145 lbs, with a large bust; if that helps you choose a size. I also want to note that the decorated sleeves are soft and gentle on sensitive skin.<br /><br />There is one small problem. The skirt is a strange fabric which wrinkles easily, needs to be ironed on a very low setting, and resists ironing altogether. I'm not sure how long this fabric will hold out.<br /><br />That said, the dress is good for gentle use, comfortable, and well priced. I would recommend it you need something short term."
4.0,"The watch face was pretty but the band cheap. Returned it and was told I was discredited the amount.  After two months, has not been discredited to my card.  I bought two of these so out $30."
4.0,Nice material. Nice dress
4.0,Make sure to order way bigger than needed.  But very soft and comfortable.  Machine wash gentle and air dry only make sure to tie strings together.
4.0,This is just a little shorter than I am comfortable with as just a dress (about 5 inches above the knee for me at 5'9). I wore it with leggings and it was a cute outfit! I like the feel of the material as it is soft and the color is such a pretty and deep emerald. My only complaint is that there are lines that separate the dress into 3 segments and on is supposed to sit under the bust but sits almost right on mine - I have to keep tugging it down or it looks a little funny. Otherwise it is fine and will be a winter staple for me!
4.0,These are really neat tags and bought some for myself and my daughter.  I think she will enjoy the fun tags as I do.
4.0,comfortable and soft! A good fit and easy wear and care right out of the dryer.
4.0,"Very attractive, love the zip off hood. Has some good pockets, but many of the pockets are false - for looks only."
4.0,Love the product. It‚Äôs my everyday mask during these COVID-19 times. I use it in the gym all the time. The adjustable string helps keep it in place. I wash it in the sink or in the shower. It dries relatively quickly. It works great as a headband or hair wrap too.
4.0,They were almost impossible to pull up. It took so long that I gave up the next day.
4.0,"Very pretty cosmic/galaxy design ; I'm excited to wear them out tomorrow! They're the tiniest bit big on my legs, but I'm rather scrawny so that's to be expected."
4.0,Nice dress. Great material. It‚Äôs a little snug so you maybe go up a size. Overall it‚Äôs a great little dress.
4.0,Fits as expected but after a wash appears to be a tiny bit too short.
4.0,Goes well with the Apple Watch 6 rose gold. Really nice color. Seems easily scratchable as my first one came with scratches.
4.0,"I love everything about this aside from three things: the strings are quite literally long shoe strings, it runs a bit small (especially around the chest), and it comes up a bit high in the back. I bought this to wear with my wedding dress, and unfortunately had to purchase a different shaper because the top of the corset was several inches above the back of my dress. Other than those few things I loved the material and it looks great once sinched up."
4.0,It fits ok without glasses but shifts while wearing glasses
4.0,"This romper is really cute, but it runs super huge. Great material for summer. Not giving it 5 stars just because the size is off."
4.0,Nice heavy duty mask
4.0,I like these socks even thought they are not as thick as I wanted/hoped and the heel bunches up a little.  I wear an 11 shoe so am surprised they bunch.  Will wash them and I am sure they will &#34;shrink to fit&#34; .
4.0,"Only problem is the lines from the built in panty shows through. Great length, don‚Äôt sag when wet and good material for kayaking, etc."
4.0,"These glasses certainly serve their purpose and offer me protection at work in health care. However, they are quite tight on my face and I have a relatively small face. I find that I have to take them off often. They also do fog up at times."
4.0,Customer was what we expected.  No issue with it.
4.0,I notice size chart was 65 % actual fit and  order bigger size which was not a good idea dress didn't fit propley and I had to return it.
4.0,So cute for pinky ring. Comfy. Can wear on other fingers too.
4.0,Nice quality dress. The bust area could have had a smaller fit for an x-small. I'm still debating if I will keep it.
4.0,These really seem to help with light glare during night driving. This is my 3rd different pair and they seem to work much better than the 2 previous glasses i tried.
4.0,This was a gift for my flower girls at our wedding. They loved them. I would recommend this product. Thanks!
4.0,Was probably the most comfortable jacket that I've had in a long time
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34;, 175 lbs., and size 38 DD.  I purchased a large and it fits nicely because the fabric is forgiving."
4.0,I liked the way they fit and not too tight in the waist and very comfortable..<br />I would like to buy more of these but not so much with the POLO on the side of them..  Do you have any others like this plain?
4.0,good quality charm chain cheap
4.0,Very pretty and with the money.  The size was off a but but I made it work.
4.0,Wish it was a little more constricting in the lower section
4.0,"Such adorable cases, but not a lot of padding.  I worry they won't protect his glasses enough."
4.0,Lace breaks easily. Comfortable
4.0,I lose my earrings allll the time so I can‚Äôt wear anything super expensive. These look super good and for the price I don‚Äôt mind if I lose one every weekend.
4.0,"Obviously sort of cheaply made, some of the clasps are a bit loose, but overall worth the price and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with them breaking, getting stuck, or irritating my ears"
4.0,"This Sweater goes well with Jeans or Slacks, I personally think it goes a bit better with Jeans though. I like the pattern and the fit is true to size. A great gift option"
4.0,Love the way they look ! We'll see how well they hold up
4.0,So good üòä
4.0,Bought for niece after abdominal surgery.  She loves the color and soft material. Nice pj's!
4.0,"The dress was great, it fits as expected only issue there isn't enough stretch around the shoulders"
4.0,My legs felt great even after a 13 hour day at work
4.0,Nice looking. A little short though for a large man.
4.0,"Stretchy, Thin, smooth fabric."
4.0,This is blue not black and much more blue than it looks in the picture. It fits wide and short and kind of floppy including the hat which doesn‚Äôt stand up until it‚Äôs on the head then it takes the shape of your head like a sock. It took over a month to come do it‚Äôs not really worth returning but I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased for $80 if I saw it at a store. It‚Äôs fine but not worth the price.
4.0,"Great color and material, it's pretty swingy and loose. I belt it to make it more defined. Material is thin, but can work for beach wear or upgrade with a sweater and tights for cold weather. It has pockets that make the sides bulge a bit."
4.0,"The sizing on these is typical Asian sizing - meaning size up based on US sizes.  In my case I wear XL shorts in US brands like Champion, Nike, etc. and a 2XL in these HEALONG shorts fit me just fine.<br /><br />The shorts themselves are fine.  The cut isn't very flattering - instead of an inseam the crotch area just sort of bags downward.  The fabric is nice and high quality and thick enough that you can wear them in public with no concerns, the drawstring is heavy duty with metal ends and metal rivets in the shorts where the drawstring enters.  And the pockets are large enough for a decent sized cellphone.<br /><br />Overall they are fine lounge shorts with a slightly baggy cut to them - at least in the 2XL size."
4.0,My grand Dougherty uses for summer and she says she loves.it<br />Thanks
4.0,"le encantaron a mis ni√±as, pero las luces se queman r√°pido"
4.0,I overall liked the quality of the scarf. I took off one point because it states the scarf is dark green but it is not really that dark. It is more like the green of grass blades in the spring compared to dark hunter green.
4.0,He liked the shirts but we're just a little bit too long. Guess that's my fault for ordering &#34;tall&#34; large...but love them anyways..Thanks
4.0,Got a large according to the size chart. It was a little snug. Wide neckline but unable to go off shoulder. Better order a size bigger.
4.0,"The fabric is strange, like a stretchy athletic type almost. The torso is very very square shaped. Hopefully after a couple of washes (It‚Äôs been washed once) it will be normal? I‚Äôll update."
4.0,These earrings are absolutely beautiful and lightweight. I‚Äôm glad I purchased them.
4.0,"its super cute only thing is, is the sides of it are already a bit frayed from wearing it"
4.0,Fit as expected and are very comfortable. Based upon past purchases these pants are very durable and look great for years.
4.0,Just wasn‚Äôt quite what I was expecting
4.0,Didn‚Äôt fit wide feet. Returned
4.0,I like it but its a little small in the bust.  I love the length. And the material is light and airy.
4.0,"I love these bibs--stylish yet not so tightly fitted as to be uncomfortable. But I did order a size up because I like bibs to fit loosely. The only issue I see so far is that the shoulder straps sometimes slip off, but that might be because I like a looser (not sloppy) fit. These are exactly what I wanted, and I spent a long time looking."
4.0,"I've only used these a couple of times, but I like them. The hole to slide the glasses arms through is a little bit small, but I can deal with it. I had another holder and the hole started to rip and got worse over time. So we'll see how these do."
4.0,"Very good fit. I'm 5'8&#34;, 130,<br />34&#34;,26&#34;35&#34;<br />The lining, is distinctly different than my skin. I was under the impression that it was only lace. But, if you're darker than alabaster, you may wish to take out the lining or replace it with black fabric."
4.0,"Fits well, Cute. A few loose threads."
4.0,This bag is made with good material the style is beautiful but it is too small
4.0,quick shipping and comfortable slippers.
4.0,Found the material to stain easily and stain would not come out even though I cleaned immediately.<br />Wish there was a two way zipper.
4.0,Helps withy raynauds.
4.0,It was delivered and fits very well! Pretty ring and nice design.
4.0,Okay so far
4.0,"I love these pj's but they did shrink a bit after the first washing.  I never dry in high heat.  I ways remove after about 5 mins on low heat, then hang to dry.  I love the light weight. So perfect for transitioning from one season to the next."
4.0,"This was a gift.  Only comment the receiver said was that he wished he did not have to take his glove off to use his smart phone.  Some gloves have that feature, not these.  However, they are very nice!"
4.0,Fantastic durability. The clasps on the front are a little strange and cause them to bunch a little. Not a deal breaker. They can also be a little temperamental when adjusting the length.
4.0,"I look at all the measurements and chose the correct side. However, the sides of the dress by my breast are revealing just a little too much. Maybe I'll try to get it tailored. Under then that the dress is nice for its price.."
4.0,"Wore it to a Sock Hop, everyone loved it, as did I"
4.0,"nice , i give to my friends"
4.0,"Love the size, and the way it's made with separate compartments, leather seems to be pretty decent.  Bought the brown and it's a bit 'orangy&#34;- the only reason I gave 4 stars"
4.0,"The skirt is beautiful and made from a nice quality material that is perfect for fall. However, the waist is a tad bit smaller than I expected. I typically wear a size 14 in clothing and I purchased the XXL in this skirt. If I put on a pair of spanx  the skirt should fit."
4.0,Great watch. Easy to adjust the size.
4.0,Material could be a little more sturdy but color is amazing . fit is good
4.0,"Fantastic fit and color. It hasn't shrunk, but I do notice after a few weeks and a several washes that it is starting to peel or pile (whichever you call it), not terribly but slightly noticeable. Nice and warm."
4.0,"Ok, this product looks like a piece of junk.  I received it as a gift and doubt I ever would have purchased it for myself with all the fancier training aids out there.  To my surprise, Swing Groover fulfills it's intended purpose just fine.  I hammered mine into the grass at the edge of my lawn where I don't care if it browns a bit.  There it sits, day and night, ready for a few swings whenever I feel like it.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll take a swing or two before going to work, sometimes arriving home from work, for 10 minutes here and there on the weekends.  It's a simple device.  You swing, the ball spins on its cord.  When you hit straight, it spins clean without hitting the vertical or horizontal metal posts.  If you hit it skewed, it whacks or winds around one or the other.  Generally it returns to starting position by itself.  On occasion you need to unwind it from the horizontal post, which generally can be done with a nudge push from your clubhead, since the cord isn't really long enough to frequently double-wrap the post.<br /><br />The ball is lighter than a real golf ball, but heavy enough to feel substantial when you strike it.<br /><br />In all, nothing fancy here, but a convenient enough tool to park on your lawn from Spring to Fall."
4.0,Good mittens but the velcro on the straps is sewn on wrong at least compared to every other pair of mittens I‚Äôve ever purchased. They don‚Äôt tighten anything. Luckily they aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúneeded‚Äù so we cut them off.
4.0,"This is a soft sweater. The fit is quite big and the neck is very long, but looks good with skinny jeans or leggings."
4.0,"Depending on your calf, could be a bit snug."
4.0,"Soaked necklace over night and came out very nice and clean. Wish the scrub brush was a little bigger, but it will work."
4.0,"Look great! Ride up a bit because of how skinny they are, but honestly cant complain for the price. They do their job of cinching dresses and baggier shirts in."
4.0,good hat but too thin
4.0,Don't remember if the dimensions were listed in the description or not. We were replacing a silver cross that was about 2&#34; x 2&#34; so we were surprised that it was so small. Husband liked it just fine so that was all that matters. Seems to be holding up just fine. Chain seems a little short so some men may have trouble sliding it over their head.
4.0,"It was really cute on, a little tight on the waist area but I liked it. Ordered a small and I'm 5'5 and 120lbs. If I ordered a medium, it would have been too big."
4.0,Love the funky designs. It‚Äôs fun to put them on every morning. Only complaint is that they are just a little tight around the leg.
4.0,I have been very pleased with these shirts. They have retained their compression qualities after several washings and have not faded or changes colors. I plan on purchasing more of these shirts.
4.0,nice size  and lovely color. I had to replace the backings they looked crushed It could be they intended that look but it was alittle hard to get the back on them.
4.0,Love tokidoki and marvel? Then this is perfect for you
4.0,As pictured. Totally modified it into an Ash vs Evil Dead saw. Lots of YouTube videos on how to modify it.
4.0,"When these boots arrived, I was initially disappointed. There was a flaw on the heel of the left boot that looked as if it had been colored in with some kind of marker and then covered with clear nail polish. I packed them to send back. The next day I decided to wear them around the house to see what the fit and comfort level was. I'm glad I did. They are so cute and so comfortable that I'm keeping them. I'm hoping the flawed heel was an anomaly. That's the only reason they missed a 5 star rating."
4.0,pretty good.
4.0,"Great glasses, fun and pretty!"
4.0,Eye holes are small have to make them bigger
4.0,"The color and size are great and it fits my Vivofit 2 perfectly.  I didn't realize this doesn't have the locking button on the strap, but so far, the strap hasn't fallen off my wrist."
4.0,just received my sandals today. Feel comfortable but size is a little small. I suggest you order 1/2 size larger than you wear.
4.0,"I am required to have a see-through lunch bag at my work place, so I am constantly on the hunt for good quality clear bags. This one is a nice thick plastic with sturdy handles. The size is good - I can fit my lunch in along with some odds and ends and a jacket."
4.0,Love these boxers. Feel great and fit great.
4.0,Note - these are very small.  Make sure you look at the size.  If you are expecting normal size buttons you will be disappointed.  Still cute though.  Purchased to use in an Easter Basket.
4.0,Runs very big for girls but will be fine for guys
4.0,"The fit is great. I like the fabric texture. The drawstring was crazy long but I was able to remove the copper cord ends, cut the drawstring to length and replace the ends...now they're good"
4.0,My 88 yr old mother was delighted with this easy slip on watch with the large easy to read face.  Now watching carefully to make sure it keeps accurate time as the price was so low ($3.99)
4.0,"great watch.  Cute.  Works well.  I expected it to fit somewhat snug, but it's fairly loose.  Fits more like a bracelet."
4.0,ears were kind of small but the tail was fine.
4.0,love shoe<br />runs small
4.0,It‚Äôs not the softest but considering it was about 1/2 the price Etsy shops were asking for it was worth it. I took a star because it pilled a lot the first two times I wore it. So I‚Äôd wash it two times before wearing it or go at it with a lint roller to save yourself the embarrassment not being able to take off your sweater because your T-shirt is too covered with fuzz.  Got a large for my 5‚Äô5‚Äù self and 168 pounds
4.0,"as expected, very pretty and came with a bonus item"
4.0,"light weight, maybe a little to dark for me, excellent mirror surface, great polarizing"
4.0,Made very well .
4.0,Lots of ventilation for summer running.
4.0,I loved the wrist band my reason for four stars is because it was too loose around my wrist I wanted it nice and snug. I ordered the smallest size. I may have to customize it by sewing it which is a bit of an inconvenience.
4.0,"The dress looks better than in the pictures, a nice surprise and perfect for the occasion I ordered it for. The zipper was a little catchy: otherwise I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase"
4.0,It fits well despite being a little small. No complaints besides that. Still debating how I should wash it though
4.0,"My boyfriend wears a true size 11 and the 10.5-11 fits him comfortably. He said that they‚Äôre comfortable to wear, they just slide a bit and they squeak A LOT. They‚Äôre a thicker foam material and seem to hold up well to regular wear and tear."
4.0,"I love the pockets, the way the pants fit to form, and the size of the opening at the bottom of the legs is perfect; not too much flare and not hugging your ankles or sitting awkwardly on your shoes. They faded pretty hard on the first wash and there's no where to tie up the bottom strings so that I'm not walking on them, but they're still cute even faded."
4.0,"It's pretty good for the price. It's not as ""scrunch-y"" as it looks in the picture and mine seems to attract a little bit of lint but honestly it's not bad at all. I like that's it's a super casual band I can wear with the watch and it gives it a cool look as opposed to youre typical watch band"
4.0,"I was very surprised at all of the bad reviews on this item. But after seeing them I thought I would go ahead and shop around. My daughter had been wanting  a necklace like this and after seeing one similar that I had purchased for $3.00 that I love. I started by going to where I used to get discount jewelry before I started buying from Amazon , TJ Maxx. After looking and seeing that similar items cost more even at  their deep discount prices I thought I'd try Claire's where I thought maybe I could find a version not quite as nice as mine for like a dollar, which again I found similar items that were not as nice as this one But more expensive. I then tried Target & Walmart at the jewelry case and items of the same weight that looked almost the same were more than triple the price and in their costume jewelry the prices were higher. So I went ahead despite the reviews and ordered this necklace, and I must say that I loved what we got. I'm not sure what people expect to get for $2.22. Anywhere else you couldn't get something that looked like it came out of a bubble gum machine for that price. I think It's really not fair to the vendor when people expect to get something that looks like the hope diamond for a couple dollars. Even if the stone falls out and you have to glue it back in, its still very much worth the price. Mine was loose so I went ahead and glued the stone to reinforce it. I then put a very light coat of clear fingernail polish over the clear stones (like i always do on jewelry with smaller stones that arent real). Ive never had a stone to fallout when i do that and you cant tell its on there as long as you dont get heavy handed and glob it on. The stone was very clear and shiny and the necklace was pretty. You really cant ask for better quality for the price."
4.0,Thick material. Not cheap. Fits well. Hugs nicely but not too tight. Good length.
4.0,"Sizing was fine but your girl has a bit of junk in the trunk so the dress was too short in back. I knotted the front and wore as a tunic. Besides that, sizing is true to size, fabric is soft. Ended up buying the other color too!!!"
4.0,Es una caqueta muy bonita pero me lleg√≥ con un defecto en la tela. Bonito color.
4.0,def feels like it could break easily but for the price its useful
4.0,Fits great for cheap
4.0,"This is a basic leotard for girls practice, is a bit big but will have room to grow. Price was right, and delivery was quick."
4.0,"i thought it was more like t-shirt material. not.<br /><br />however, the shirt is very stretchy and very comfortable. It washes well and tumbles dry on low well with very little shrinkage. Drapes well with body shape, but i'd still like a jersey knit a little better."
4.0,"The card and necklace are beautiful however, the card came with a brown substance on it. I was able to clean it off but it was nasty to see coming out of a sealed package."
4.0,Length of pants!!
4.0,They are pretty good! Cant wait to use them on sunny hot days! They look exactly like pictured.
4.0,Cute strap. Looks as pictured. Would work best with light weight camera. Would not trust for a big dslr
4.0,Awesome sweatshirt but is not sized right. I ordered a 3x and it fit like a US XL. Given it 4 stars because the quality of the sweatshirt was pretty good.
4.0,A good brush
4.0,"The watch looks expensive for the price.  Received several favorable comments regarding its appearance  Had problems setting the date until I realized after pulling the stem to the #1 position you must turn the stem of the watch counter clockwise (as the instructions directs U to do when setting the time). Also, when winding the watch ... (wind it with ease);  to the point that when you feel the winding has STOPPED..... DO NOT force to continue winding. The WIND usually last the extended time that U wear the watch. You will have to proceed the same process after placing the watch off of your arm overnight.  Love the watch just knowing I will have No More batteries to purchase. I have even ordered another AUTOMATIC watch the AMPM24 Retro Bronze Steel Automatic Skeleton for everyday use.  M. Theriot - Baton Rouge, Louisiana"
4.0,Good selection for easily swapping out piercings
4.0,Great idea but not the easiest to use. Does the trick though.
4.0,Beautiful color.  Looks great for the price.
4.0,"Really like the image of the Phoenix, and the color background that it is set in. Just feels right."
4.0,It looks nice but the material is just a bit rough on the skin and it doesn't have the same comfortable compression as my compression socks.
4.0,Comfortable for long rides on my motorcycle
4.0,I would like to see these with a nose wire to more closely fit around the nose and reduce fogging of glasses. I think a noise wire would keep it in place better too.
4.0,"Alright. The dimensions are printed in the review, I read the review, so I can't fault the vendor. But I'm showing a photo of the pin next to a US nickel coin. If you're looking for a lightening bolt pin that is barely bigger than a button on a dress shirt, this is for you."
4.0,"I ordered both the grey and the pink shirt. The grey shirt runs slightly large, and it is made of a thicker, somewhat scratchy polyester material with little stretch. The fit is looser. The pink shirt is made of a much thinner, smooth, stretchy spandex-type material. The fit is skin-tight. Both shirts are flattering and serve their purpose. I just wanted to inform potential buyers that the grey and pink shirts are NOT made of the same material, they fit differently, and they have different brand names on the tag."
4.0,The fabric is very thin and doesn't feel especially sturdy.
4.0,"great smooth finish, the paint job on the eyes was great, nice weight to the charm, the only reason i dint give it a 5 star is because of the necklace it comes with. the necklace is super light and cheap looking. but not a bad charm for the pice :)"
4.0,Bought this for my Granddaughter. She's still little to wear it. They did not have her size when I ordered it.
4.0,"I wear this as a simple choker necklace. I didn't realize how dainty it was until I received it in the mail. I am not disappointed by any means. It's actually really cute and I wear it even in the shower or in the water. Initially, I loved how it didn't snag on my hair but after wearing it everyday for about a month, I do feel it getting caught in my hair sometimes. Other than that, I do love it. Just annoying to deal with because of my medium/long hair. It seems sturdy and really is shiny and white looking."
4.0,"It is smaller tha n I expected.  But that is okay it is for my Grandaughter. It is very shinny,  looks great. I think she will like it."
4.0,These shirts are nice but fit is 2 sizes small. Med should be a xsmall.
4.0,Love it but it is a little loose now
4.0,This dress is fun and for a great price.  I wore it to a Great Gatsby themed party and received lots of compliments.  I made a few minor adjustments but overall it looks like the picture.  The small fits a bit big through the waist and hips.  I am 5'3 and 130 and it was loose and past my knees.
4.0,Dress fit and came as described.
4.0,"Unexpectedly beautiful. Not the best quality materials, may not last after washing. One less star for being super super stinky! Had to hang it outside all day and then it still smelled- still, afraid to wash it. Will continue to air it out."
4.0,I like this for style. The fabric is on the thin side and does not have a lot of give but it is fine for warm days and special occasions. Probably not an everyday outfit but super cute.
4.0,"Item is as described, having the T bar to use with my quick connect has been great. The one aspect I would change would be a keyed version in stead of a combination."
4.0,Little large on bottom.
4.0,Got a small for my 12 year old daughter.  It is cute and held up well for her 50s themed school dance.  Only complaint is that the sleeves are too short so we rolled them up a bit and all was fine otherwise.  Good price and happy to have not paid more at a costume store.
4.0,"Nice shirt, fit as expected"
4.0,It looks nice but the fabric is easy to get wrinkle .
4.0,"I always buy spaghetti strap clothes, but never wear them without cardigans or jackets cause I HATE strapless bras. I finally tried this, and I love it!! I am size 38D so it helps keeps me in, but it doesn't keep them high very well. The stickiness works great, it just won't work like a push up bra would. If you wear a dress or top with some sort of shape given around the bust they will look great, but if you just wear a t-shirt your boobs won't look perky, just a natural height."
4.0,"These were advertised as tight fitting, but I got mine 1 size larger and it fits perfect, not too tight or too loose.  Did come in with a funny funky synthetic smell from the fabric but it went away with the second wash."
4.0,"Are use this product for construction. The original if it was a little loose for my foot, because they were only available in wide. I added insoles and they fit much better now.They are only available in wide. They are also not very warm. In comparison to my boots. But that is great for the summer"
4.0,"great, I'd buy again for sure"
4.0,It fit the purpose
4.0,I got this as a gift.
4.0,Good looking charm and well made
4.0,"Did run small. I ordered a size larger. Was close to picture but not exact. I'm having it altered for a handful of nit picky things. Straps came detached so they could be sown to size. Overall, very pretty and flowy. Pics to come..."
4.0,"These are very cute and perfect for my cartilage piercing. My only complaints are that the post is kind of short and barely fit the width of my ear, and that the stone is not as large as I'd imagined it would be. I attached pictures of the packaging, earrings, and the gauge of the post compared to that of a normal lobe earring."
4.0,Keeps my head and ears some what warmer while biking. A bit ichy though.
4.0,delivered on time. fits nicely and has a nice feel to the material
4.0,"A very beautiful set, looks elegant and classic."
4.0,"First, the fabric print is crisp, beautiful (I ordered navy background) and cotton!  It can be dressed up or down.  I ordered a large and it fits perfect (I wear a 12).  I am 5‚Äô10 and curvy.  Looks very flattering!  I got lots of compliments."
4.0,Look great and worked wonderfully for the bracelets I made!
4.0,Ties are a little short in length
4.0,"good quality and color, still though it would have the logo on the tip of the laces. was looking to replace my nike tiempo laces"
4.0,"Very nice , warm , comfy coat !"
4.0,"I purchased 4 pairs of these sleeves for my 96 year old aunt who had dementia and is prone to bruising or cutting her arms when she moves around. A worker at her residential facility suggested we buy these sleeves for her to prevent further injuries, and they have worked quite well. Since she's had them, she hasn't bruised herself or experienced any more cuts on her arms. Her skin is so fragile that it didn't take much for her to hurt herself. These sleeves have been wonderful."
4.0,I think these are super cute and sporty. Only complaint is they came a tad bit tight. I am sure with basic wear they will stretch so my next time purchase will be a size higher than what I bought this time. Overall super comfortable got them super quick! So will happily purchase another pair in the near ish future
4.0,The little purse is made with a very good quality leather. It's useful if you don't want to carry almost nating just you cell phone  and small things.
4.0,Fits well. The fabric could be a little thicker
4.0,"Great watch.  Simple black design.  Needs to have the month number though.  Also, too easy to bump the button that switches it to 24 hr mode."
4.0,"these glasses are very beautiful and half the price of others I looked at, however they do run a little small or tight. I have a cranial shunt in my head and after a half hour or so the glasses make my head hurt. So I save them to wear for very short periods of time.  My head is a little more sensitive than others so tight does bother me more than a lot of folks, I suppose. They are very nice glasses I just wish they din't feel so tight on my head."
4.0,"They definitely fit a wide range of sizes lol. I do like the fact they have fleece in the inside but it is a ton of cloth in the waist due to the size range, but they aren't bad."
4.0,"I like this top, its vintage and fits comfy.. a bit too big, but its still cute"
4.0,They are nice but bigger than the average.I would by again.
4.0,"So cute! Fit is perfect and it‚Äôs a soft, comfortable material. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it on Valentine‚Äôs Day!"
4.0,Soft material. Overall good quality.
4.0,These have rubber grippers that hold onto the eyeglass stems.  The glasses stay in the grippers and don't fall out.  The lanyard part could be a little longer...
4.0,These are perfect to wear to work-light weight and fits in my work shoes. A few things I don‚Äôt like is there is no navy or dark blue color in the multi-pack; and the gold color is hideous.
4.0,Cute dress. Material is cotton and it‚Äôs too casual for work. I thought about returning it but it is cute so I‚Äôm keeping it for weekends.
4.0,What it said it was
4.0,"Eye glass straps are good,but the socks got small holes in them you can't see till you put them on."
4.0,"This is a wonderful addition to my wardrobe that can be dressed up or down. I took a star off because there is a slit where the tulle meets the cotton that is very high, but that's nothing that a safety pin can't fix. Fits TTS, 5'6&#34;, 160 lbs. A large would work but the medium looks more flattering. It hits me right about above the knees like it does on the model."
4.0,"Nice jacket, just order one size up for better fit"
4.0,"Tends to shrink<br />Tends to fade quickly<br />But is made well,  no issues with falling apart<br />I work on a covid unit so wear all the time"
4.0,"I like that these pants fit my petite frame. The waistline hits at the waist and the length is good with high heels. I have sown in the pockets because I prefer the flat front line, therefore, I gave 4 stars. Material is soft and warm like a flannel. I like the color and the subtle stripe."
4.0,"This dress fabric is soft and comfy, but it runs small. I ordered 4 sundresses in a small and they all fit except this one. Going to reorder in a so medium."
4.0,Is very nice to use! Highly Recommended!
4.0,Excellent long summer dress
4.0,"I bought S. I'm 34D. And it fitted me just right. I like my tops which fit me right tight. The peplum line sits on my tummy, why I see many say its uncomfortable. I hve a near flat tummy and it doesn't make me uncomfy. I recommend to try this top. I loved its smoothness n pattern."
4.0,Very comfy but does fade afterlife 2 washed
4.0,Cute panties but they run small
4.0,Loved it! gave this to my mom for mother's day just this Sunday since she's about to be a grandma in August! She absolutely loved it. The only down side I can say was the packaging it came in since I wanted this as a gift I had to go and get a nice box to put it in but other than that I'm very happy with it.
4.0,"Perhap my 18 month old has a small head, size is for 6 to 18 months and my son just started wearing it. I like that this hat is adjustable and protects him from the sun."
4.0,"Love this band got alot of compliments so far. Kind of bothered me the first day I wore it but now I forget I have it on sometimes. So far I've snagged it on clothing, chin hair (ouch), and pulled some wrist hairs but still was worth the buy. Quick adjustments made possible with a magnetic end piece."
4.0,"The dress is cute, howeve. Based on the size chart, I would have expected to wear a medium, but I need a small. Size probably depends on body shape. I am top heavy, therefore I thought the bottom of the dress had to much room. We‚Äôll see what happens after washing.  I think the dress may be more flattering on ladies with larger hips."
4.0,"This is pretty darn cute.  The lettering is pretty large,  but it's the right size to make a statement and be &#34;hip hop style&#34; without being too ridiculous. Obviously if you're wearing a necklace that says &#34;slay&#34; you don't want it to fade into the background, and this does not! I really liked the chain, easy to put on,  this will be fun to wear.  The only thing for me is that even though the chain is adjustable,  I found it a bit too long. On the shortest setting it hangs literally right above my cleavage,  whereas I would like it up a bit higher."
4.0,"While this isn't an exact replica, as a long time fan of Supernatural and Dean Winchester, this is a fun and inexpensive collectible."
4.0,Love the color and the detail is beautiful
4.0,"Delivery was quick which is not unusual being a prime member. I ordered these after watching a YouTube review. I LOVE the fabric, it's so soft and dense. The waist band is a firm elastic that provides mild compression. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because the sizing was off. I'm normally a medium in leggings (5ft 145lbs), so the medium size I ordered were a bit snuck, however, as tight as they were on me these leggings were still SQUAT PROOF!  I'll be exchanging, maybe gifting them, but I'll for sure be sizing up."
4.0,"Overall nice product, the stone is a little too big for me personally"
4.0,Bought these for my bridesmaids!!
4.0,I have been so impressed by how comfortable they are and have ordered two more pairs so I can keep one pair in my car and one pair with my bike.
4.0,Product is as it describes.  However the keychains did not come in the velvet bags as it states.  They were in  little boxes.
4.0,Very cute maxi dress. I wear mine with my combat boots and I love it. The dress is somewhat comfortable but the band on the top is very tight. Usually maxi dresses can be worn all day without any issues but this dress becomes uncomfortable after a few hours because of the band at the top of the dress!  I do love the color and design!  The material seems to be of good quality!
4.0,Good ! Loved the shirt
4.0,Had to super glue the flower back on due to it popping off
4.0,Would've given 5 stars because of high quality but they run big. I'm a med and they fit me huge. I would however purchase again in a size small. Colors are very pretty and quality is great!!
4.0,"I love the look and feel. It is very comfortable. But it is very thick. When I added the filter to it, it made my face hot. I was in the sun at a football game and my face got very hot. No air was getting in. I guess that's what you want, no particles getting in."
4.0,Super cute! I love them! only a couple fit my newborn for now since they're different sizes
4.0,"The fit is snug, but not too bad. My two quibbles are first, that some of the embroidery and sewing is a bit sloppily done - you can see that the butterflies in particular were patches that were sewn on, and that the seams and zipper are slightly messy. The second is that the dress is incredibly long, so if you are petite like me, you'll need really high heels. Overall, I think this is a lovely dress, but know that it's not the fanciest dress ever made. Photographs extremely well, though."
4.0,Se y on my wife
4.0,Product is not as pictured
4.0,"Nice goggles, great price! Grandson loves them!"
4.0,"Both shorts fit comfortably. The only thing I didn't like was that whenever I walk the front of the shorts wrinkle in such a way to make it seem as though I have a penis (I am a female). It's great for in house wearing, not so sure about the beach because of the winkles in the front."
4.0,"I usually order mediums in everything so that's what I went with and it was a little big. A small probably would have fit but been uncomfortable. Anyways, I was able to adjust it to my fit and it's a lovely dress. It's formal enough to wear to a wedding but casual enough to eat out or see a movie. I'll be buying more dresses in the future but I'm concerned about fit."
4.0,"Things I love about this ring: diameter, gauge, easy of closing, durability (it hasn't come out on accident once)<br />Thing I don't love about this ring: multicolor effect hasn't been applied well<br /><br />As shown in the photos, the ring that is predominantly green is this one and the true multicolor one is my older version.  It's still a pretty color though, and these are so easy to put on and take off I still wear it.  I've tried other, more inexpensive, clickers and they are very difficult to click closed.  This hinged ring snaps shut with ease and stays that way.  The only reason it isn't 5-stars is the color issue, because I know it can be done better on this size ring (it looks the same on both sides so flipping it around doesn't help)."
4.0,I am 5'10&#34; and 150 lbs. The large works well for me. These are super cute and long enough- especially with the thick elastic cuff around the ankles. Drawstring is nice too. The front pocket area is a a little baggy for my liking... but that is my only complaint.
4.0,"Love these shoes. My baby hated wearing other shoes but actually keeps this on his feet. Frankly, I'm a vegetarian and don't wear leather myself, if it was a choice I would prefer a non-leather material though."
4.0,"I was disappointed that the colours were bright and vivid, rather than the heathered appearance I see online.  It fit as expected, but because I am only 5 ft. tall, is more of a dress than a tunic:  it comes just to my knees. the XL fits my 175 lbs. well, covering various lumps.  The usable pockets are at the hips, but do not bulge at that area.  The material is soft and the dress is comfortable, but I find the armholes cut a bit small. The one star deduction was for the colour intensity as well as the armholes."
4.0,Very light & comfortable. Washes up good.  Does wrinkle easily. Love the color
4.0,"looks nice, feels great!"
4.0,Great top ... I found that it was a tiny bit on the larger side than what I was expecting ... but it still fits.
4.0,Great Quality<br />Great Price
4.0,Goes well with my little black dress
4.0,I ordered a M. I am 5'4. 115 LBs. 34-29-35. Shoulder to shoulder is 14.5 inches.<br />The jacket is off-white; though in the sun it looks white.<br /> There is NO pockets.<br />There is a band on the back off my shoulder always seems to be bumpy in the back. (see pic)<br />The band doesn't bother me that much but if you are looking for a perfect smooth back. It might be a concern.
4.0,"Is as good as I expected.  Is a tad heavy, but that's fine."
4.0,"It runs small go up a size I'm 5,3 186  with curve I ordered an xlarge and need a xxlarge"
4.0,Great color and fits well.  It was shipped and received rather quickly.  I haven't bought anything like it to compare but am very pleased with the quality.
4.0,"These are pretty but are ultra light weight.  They are flat so some of the detail is a bit blunted.  I still like them for myself, for everyday wear, but would not give them as a gift."
4.0,Very nice. Material is soft.
4.0,"As a mail man I can‚Äôt  go through to mail by right hand finger. This the only problem . Other then that it‚Äôs ok . One thing please let me know that same material but more flexible with right hand finger ,I may go to mail/paper by finger."
4.0,Good fit. Looks nice
4.0,"Lovely necklace, looks more expensive than it is. The chain is a bit lightweight, but for the price, it's really a great item."
4.0,Like the fit but wish it was a bit longer in the back.
4.0,PattERN
4.0,"Recently pretty much wore these everyday on a 4500 mile road trip. Only real gripe is the pad on the right leg is about 3 inches too short. Ended up melting a little on exhaust, but nothing duct tape couldn't fix."
4.0,Good for the belly portion but the sticky material that holds them up doesn‚Äôt really work as it folds and I find myself putting the underwater up every second
4.0,"The colors were a little brighter than I expected, but it is a cute casual dress. LOVE that it has pockets! :)"
4.0,These goggles are perfect for my children. They're low cost and are perfect for kids who play in cold weather and snow.
4.0,a bit noisy but very nice design
4.0,"This is a cute set, and I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I have to knock off one star because of the top. The description states that the fabric is cotton and will be soft, but the top doesn't feel like cotton at all. Plus, it isn't as soft as I expected.<br /><br />While the pants are thin, it doesn't feel as rough as the top. And they definitely feel a lot more comfortable than the top. Also wish that the top could have been a little bit longer and stretchable, but it fits perfectly, so that's a plus. The pants fit as well. I recommend another tank top underneath if you're uncomfortable with the amount of skin showing.<br /><br />My little girl is 6 years old; about 3 ft, 6 inches tall; and weighs under 55 pounds (bust is 24 in, waist is 25 in, and hips are 27 in). I ordered size 5 -6X, and it fits just right."
4.0,"Gloves are very warm and functional. Unfortunately one size does NOT fit all especially being a woman even with large hands. But, in bitter cold, I can easily pull my fingers back towards my palm in these gloves facilitating their overall warmth. I like these gloves because they are warm and do not require hand warmers for extended stays outdoors."
4.0,These are pretty comfy and light. I will def be wearing them when working outside.
4.0,I like this style of beanie and it's good at keeping me warm however it does slip off my head frequently so I wish it were a bit larger. It works well with my naturally curly hair by keeping my curls hydrated.
4.0,we'll see how long they last before they break<br />..
4.0,On the thin side. I like thicker socks for more cushion but not bad.
4.0,Very comfortable. Thin summer dress.
4.0,"Frankly overpriced for the quality it seems. There were threads hanging off some of the seams and I have no idea how long the stitching will last because of it. I had many similar pairs from a few different brands for prices like $12 per 3-pack to $26 per 2-pack. Those never last more then like 6-8 months because the stitching always sucks and comes undone. So I bit my lip and bought the more expensive brand like thinx expecting better quality stitching. These aren't even the most expensive underwear I own so I would be ok with the price if these were actually high quality overall. And the only thing these underwear seem to have gotten wrong IS the stitching as everything else including the materials seems to be quality. The only upside to these is they are for super heavy flow. A whole diaper really without looking like one. Most of the ones I own are for light and moderate flow. And I have like 3 pairs for really heavy flow but these seem to absorb even more then that. Kinda excessive for me as my flow is generally low to moderate for most periods. I don't bleed enough in the 8 hours that a pair of period undies should be worn to fill-up these even to a half-way point. But wearing them longer then 12 hours is also not an option because I don't want any bacterial infections, thank you very much.<br />BTW here is my PSA: Period underwear, just like any other period product, is not meant to be worn for too long. 12 hours should be the absolute max, but frankly you should aim to change your underwear every 6-8 hours. That means that if you wash them immediately you need like 7-8 pairs at the minimum in order for them to be changed 3-4 times a day and have time to dry afterwards.<br />With the previous information in mind, the amount of undies I would need of this sort for a single period is gigantic. Considering how often these need to be washed, the fact they do not dry quickly as these are for super heavy flow, the fact that the stitching seems so flawed, and that you would need to own a lot of these to cover your whole period if you account for how long these dry: they are not worth the price in my opinion. I guess get them if you have super heavy flow days. They should be good for that. But supplement them with other types of period undies for when you aren't on the super heavy flow. I might give the brand one more try in maybe their heavy or moderate flow underwear. I definitely will not be getting another pair of these specific ones simply because I don't bleed so heavy and so these will not be used often anyway. Another thing I have to mention is that these run small. I usually wear a 2x-3x in undies from different brands and these I had to get in a 4x and they fit like a glove. So yeah sizing is definitely smaller then I am used to. 4 stars because these do work well. I just don't know how well they will last. I will probably update the review at some point when they become unusable to see how long they lasted and what failed first. If the stitching actually does hold up for over a year then I might change to 5 stars. I really do need to try another pair though I think. The cut on these is flattering for my bodyshape though and all the other thinx I have seen do not look promising."
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but material is thin.
4.0,Great jacket.  Warm!!
4.0,"Little disappointed at the feel, looks like the picture."
4.0,"Great shoe,  very great for walking."
4.0,"This is actually a very pretty necklace that looks like clouds. It might also serve as an Earth necklace in a pinch. It‚Äôs light and pretty and comes with a standard chain, long enough for most necks. I do have to say this necklace does have a ‚Äúside‚Äù to it. One side truly looks like clouds, while the other kinda just looks like a styrofoam explosion. The ball is super light so it may feel cheap to some. I think this is a fun necklace that can be enjoyed by many, but it is not a super high-quality necklace. It‚Äôs great for casual days or younger wearers."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c5dab24b5d390f2b5ed0073b69682cd3]] These shoes are a very cute, with thick shoe soul. The color is nice.<br />The item is true to size. I purchased a size 6, and my daughter wears a 5.5 shoe. Sizing is similar to popular brands such as Carters, Puma, & Nike tennis shoes. It is as pictured. There were a few hanging threads, but those can be clipped easily without destroying the shoes."
4.0,Love this case so much. The only negative for me is where the keychain is. I wish it were on the bottom of the phone. I work for a company I'm constantly taking pictures and my keys block my camera. Gets really annoying. Other than that the case is great quality and I love the handle and card holder.
4.0,"Beautiful cut, feels adequately made, covered well to flatter postpartum body. Heavy material so would be warm in very hot weather but great in mild to cooler weather. Material becomes puckered and wavy in spots if anything wet spills on it. I.e. when ironing or if water drops come in contact otherwise- can be ironed out"
4.0,Pretty bracelet. I would have given it 5 stars but I found it a little light weight and I am waiting to see how it holds up.
4.0,"Backpack is great, just wish the lunch kit was a little bigger and better insulated!"
4.0,So far so good !  Fits my pandora bracelet.
4.0,like to colors
4.0,"I really liked this but 2 things - it wasn‚Äôt really green, it was more of a gray color than anything.. And it was huge!! I ordered the smallest size, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 105 lbs and it was way too big. Like 2 sizes too big. It was still really cute and comfortable but need to return."
4.0,"I am having a Halloween engagement party with a very small group of family. So I bought this for an elegant look to go with my dress. Very comfortable but kinda see through, will probably wear a medical mask underneath for safty."
4.0,Asian sizing. It's a little short for my long torso but still works. I got the largest size available when I purchased. This is thin and easily snags. I'm 5'7&#34; and have the same length legs as my 5'4&#34; mom. I often hand wash or wash this with my other asian shirts 8n delicate cycle in the machine. It hangs dry in no time.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this bra. I am normally a 32D so I ordered a 34C as other reviews say it runs small. The band is rather tight but it comes with an extender which is nice. I am able to wear it on the loosest hooks without the extender. The cups are a little on the small side but not too bad. Other than that, the bra is very comfortable since it is wireless and there is not too much padding. The ribbon, when pulled tight, gives me great cleavage! Overall I would recommend buying this bra as long as you figure out what size would work best for you."
4.0,El mete dedos es muy estrecho
4.0,"Looks great, fun graphics, gets lots of compliments. It is not the softest shirt I own but I still really like it.... Because queso."
4.0,This is a absolutely gorgeous dress for the price! I received compliments all night. The only negative is it‚Äôs short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and my ankles and feet were exposed. So make sure you have some cute shoes that match.
4.0,"I really like this ring and I already left a great review but wanted to warn others----if you buy the one with the yellow smiley face in it, the yellow part comes off if it gets wet. Mine is completely silver after 4 days of owning it. It's still cute so I don't mind, but just a heads up!"
4.0,I'm a tell slender man. I went one size up and it's a little short in the arms.
4.0,"Its 100 percent cotton its a little tight so im afraid to wash it in hot water, but its nice, the screenprinting is done well. A little expensive for a simple band logo on a cheap black tshirt. If it were nicer vintage looking or fitting i could see it being worth it but over all its a cute top, i love spacemen 3 so i wanted it. Its just expensive for  basically a fitted tshirt. The sizing from usa to uk confused me so i shoulda ordered a lg a i suppose, im a small in the usa but i believe i ordered uk medium. It fits but it may shrink, but a too large of a size in this fitted t style would just look stupid so I'd rather it tight than baggy with the fitted t shirt style, but thats my preference. My error on converting sizes as well, not the company's fault. $20 - $24.99  would be a more reasonable price.  But i wanted it and band shirts with bands i dig are hard to come by on Amazon."
4.0,"My daughter likes it and it seems to be well made.  It took quite a while to get here, but shipping was free, so cannot complain about that."
4.0,"These guys are bigger than a real gummybear, standing at about 1 inch tall. They‚Äôre hollow and squeezable (like a bouncy ball) but not squishy. The price is a bit ridiculous for a hollow mold with an LED light inside."
4.0,"Love these boots , the calf is tapered though"
4.0,Adorable glasses. Good quality lenses.  But the frames are HUGE!  A very large man might be able to wear them and keep them on his face.  I could not.
4.0,The dress fits really well but the zipper is poorly done.
4.0,"I found this to be tight so I removed one star for sizing.  It is well made and, as long as you are careful with the sizing, you should love it."
4.0,"too small and uncomfortable like a husband in a sexless couple like me. if no one would see, don't buy these."
4.0,Favorte wallet of all time. Got so many of my fam and friends to buy this. They owe me commission.
4.0,I love the design I‚Äôm a huge Superman fan I wear this band everyday I do have to say I wish the pin that holds the actual band and metal piece to the watch was a little more secure it came out of its socket one day at work. Thankfully I was able to squeeze it back into place it has not done it again but I alway check to see it‚Äôs in place just Incase. Other than that band is awesome it really stands out.
4.0,"I like this bra for a weekend bra, it's very comfortable, gives a slight lift, and is pretty. I removed one star cuz it can be a little itchy around the elastic band. This might go away with a few washes."
4.0,"I got the milled leather clip and really like it.  I am 75 years old and have never owned a wallet.  For years, I have carried my money, driver's license and a credit card loose in my front pocket.  Twice recently the license and card have fallen out of my pocket and I decided it was time to do something else.  I love this money clip except for one thing. The pockets for the cards are too deep and if you push a card all the way in, it is almost impossible to get it out.  I have had to use a pair of tweezers the first couple times but now just push it in part ways."
4.0,So far this has completed it job at keeping me dry. The material looks like it will hold up for a coupe of years. And if it does tear up you can't beat it for the price
4.0,Good size pendant. My wife really liked it
4.0,Color is lighter than pictured but still cute
4.0,"Super cute tanks, but yes they Technically run small-- but just follow the size chart for an accurate fit. I usually wear Smalls or size US4, and the medium fit me well.<br /><br />These tanks are sheer, but they keep cool and hug your body while you do yoga poses which is a pro! I've already gotten many compliments on them. Wish they weren't so sheer & wish the neck was a bit higher--so 4 stars.<br /><br />But I would recommend!"
4.0,"They do look a little costumey, but I still think they are adorable."
4.0,"Pricey but comfortable. A bit loose in the front. In general, they‚Äôre average sandals for everyday wear if price is not that important for you."
4.0,They are ok.  Could have been bigger
4.0,Very pretty but pearl was larger than pictured. Will not be wearing it with casual clothing. Would be fine with dressier outfits.
4.0,Delivered on time and comfy!! I'm giving 4 stars because of the leg strings! On the outside of both pant legs there are 2 strings. You can wear them down or pull the pant legs up and tie the strings. With the pant legs down I walk all over the strings. When I pull up the pant legs I walk all over the strings. Thought about cutting them or pulling them out.
4.0,Love this mask! Wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive or I‚Äôd buy more...
4.0,Eyes felt great. Ear plugs weren't as good as normal in ear headphones.
4.0,Very nice hat but it is a bit tight for my son.
4.0,I am 5'2 and 120 lbs with a tendency to gain weight in the gut.  This dress is flattering and comfortable.  I am giving it four stars because there was a hole in the seam but the dry cleaners is fixing it for $5.00 so it's worth it!
4.0,"I wear this pendant every day. I would have liked to have a chain that would have gone with this one specifically, but I've been able to find one in my collection anyways."
4.0,I was looking for some super dark sunglasses.  These are dark but not really above and beyond.  Keeping them.  They‚Äôll still get good use.
4.0,"Very nice sunglasses.  I like the transition from warm on the bottom to cool on top.  This add's good visual depth to the scene.  The contrast is nice and helpful in adding clarity and sharpness to the scene.  Fit is snug on the sides, but not too tight.  For the money, these are an awesome deal. I originally found them for $99 elsewhere and returned them and bought these. The only negative for me is  they create a flair specular from the sun when looking directly towards the sun, or very bright objects, but it never bothers me.  Overall a really nice pair for outdoor activities or sports."
4.0,"True to size fit.  Not high quality material, but good for a halloween costume.  Cute costume."
4.0,Super cute.  Too small for our daughter.
4.0,"For the price, this is a high quality watch.<br /><br />I've gotten various complements from people on the watch, little did they know It's only like $30 compared to their $150 watches. Serves the same purpose.... Although I did have quite a bit of trouble with getting the date adjusted on there. My guess is i got a faulty nob which doesn't allow it to be changed. (Although who uses a watch to look at the date anyways)"
4.0,I was asked Where did you get her culotts.  Too cute!
4.0,I like it but I don't love it.. Deff have to have a long torso for this dress.
4.0,Thanks I really like this top and it fits me just right!
4.0,I wanted it to fit loose like the pictures. I ordered a medium and it was too small. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and weigh 130. I returned it and ordered an x-large
4.0,"Lightweight hoodie, great for layering and the cool autumn weather. I sized up for my boyfriend after looking at the chart, and I'd recommend sizing up once if you don't want the hoodie too fitted. Not sure how to feel about the seam that runs across the stomach... I thought it hid a zipper pocket, but it is purely decorative/fashion choice. The pocket is like a regular hoodie, and you place your hands in through vertical slots in the hoodie which close with zippers. The pocket is fairly deep, which is nice, just not what we expected. Overall, its a nice hoodie, the horizontal seam across the low chest/stomach area isnt too noticeable in black, it has a roomy pocket, the quality seems decent, and I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,"This dress is really pretty! The sleeves are a bit tight so I would probably order a size up because my range of motion is limited in the size I ordered. Otherwise, I love it!"
4.0,Very comfortable while performing delivery duties.
4.0,Doesn't quite fit but i may get some needed power.
4.0,Very cute outfit I will be buying more colors runs kind of small
4.0,"I have this problem with a lot of pants, but these have too much fabric in the front and it bunches up. It isn't that obvious though, and overall they are comfortable. I would buy them again. They are good quality, especially for the price."
4.0,"The only downside is the weight is not insignificant. This is the exact opposite of most bands, it has substantial weight and will require getting used to. This is great if you're used to a heavy wristwatch already and the lightness of a fitbit throws you off."
4.0,"Very comfortable for dancing, does not wrinkle easily, and seems well-made.  You could dress up or dress down.  I used it belter as part of a dance costume for performance with a white tutu, but also have paired it with slinky black pants for ballroom dancing.  It would look equally good with jeans."
4.0,I like this product. I am worried how well it will last once it's washed. It's cute and what I expected
4.0,"These shoes are very cute. The Tan color is just want I wanted and goes well with jeans and khakis, and they meet my expectation of &#34;comfy shoes for work&#34;. I like that they are light weight and still have some cushion. I'm taking one star off because the fit is a bit narrow. The length of them is mostly true to size (maybe a tiny bit short but still fine), but they are very narrow so watch out for that!"
4.0,Fast delivery and it looks just like in the picture.
4.0,Beautiful and the ear rings are very light not heavy but kinda small. Wish it little bit bigger. Rather than that very decent price and I love it
4.0,This is a great skirt for the price. Fits nicely and was perfect for my photo shoot. Not as long and flowy as in the picture but it worked out great!
4.0,"This shirt is super cute! The material is a little thin but it‚Äôs soft. I‚Äôm 125 pounds/5‚Äù1 and I usually wear a small, I had to order a large so it definitely runs a little big!"
4.0,"Arrived on time, no damage to the clothing and it fits. Only problem is that when i take the jacket off theres this black stuff that sticks onto every shirt i wear which i find annoying but is easy to remove."
4.0,Used magnet bands years ago. Then changed up to leather and silicone. Decided to try magnet bands again as I find them easy to use taking off and on. Took a star off as the magnet could be stronger. Definitely a weaker version than what I used in past.
4.0,"These earrings are adorable! But... there are a few drawbacks.They are really heavy! So they don't stay straight on my ear, they kind of look downwards if that makes sense. Also, they are really thick. I wish they were thinner so they stayed close to my ear. Other than that, they are really cute & I get a lot of compliments on them."
4.0,The top is just a bit too big and gapes when slightly bent over.  The backing behind the buttons only goes to the waist and not the full length of button placement.  A slip is a must with this dress.
4.0,"It looks and works exactly as advertised. Because the slack doesn't go into a slit in the band, it gets caught on a lot of things though. Mainly my hair. But I like it."
4.0,It is a nice top but it is a bit clingy for my taste. Nothing bad about shirt I just like a loose fit
4.0,About 81/2- 9&#34;should be fine
4.0,My wife is six foot tall and 135 pounds. This dress doesn't fit her right. Looks ok. Good quality. Wish it came in tall sizes.
4.0,"They are pretty little things. I usually wear bigger earrings, but I like them because I like cardinals in the snow. They came quickly and were worth the price."
4.0,Cute baby bows.
4.0,Very soft. Beautiful color.
4.0,"Fits great on the top, but the bottom fluffs up/out a little too much.  The material isn't soft, it has an itchy feeling to it."
4.0,Fits perfectly and very stylish but the belt doesn‚Äôt stay latched if you move a certain way.
4.0,It is very cute but the sizing is wrong. Go a size smaller
4.0,Such a cute skirt for the summer! A tad bit staticky but manageable!
4.0,This is a great soft lightweight sweatshirt perfect for fall or spring definitely order a size up if you like a more fitted hoodie order two sizes up if you like a more loose fit
4.0,"I got the color &#34;flashmode.&#34; They are see-through. I exchanged for Reflex Blue on the suggestion of some friends, and they are much better (i.e., not see through). Fits as expected. Really great for the price."
4.0,For reference my baby is 6 months and usually wears shoes within his age range. My older son has one like this so I wanted them to look cute together. It is light enough for my six old month baby to wear and it buckles on one side by a Velcro unlike the bigger sizes closes with two Velcro sides. I think it is still easy to fall off a baby feet though . It isn‚Äôt ridiculously priced so I guess it‚Äôs a good buy.
4.0,"I ordered a large size, but the fit is tighter than the large polo shirts from LL Bean or Lands End. Size is similar to the Amazon brand shirts. After washing it the collar is not smooth and could use a touch up with an iron."
4.0,"Beautiful, really, but I found them too big for my ears."
4.0,"Were a loose fit, fall off my face.  Good quality if they can stay on/"
4.0,love my dress hopefully I can get mostly all the colors
4.0,"These boats do have a bit of an odd smell to them, but I'm wearing them multiple times and having them sit outside a bit will help with that. Otherwise very cute and reasonable for the price paid"
4.0,The sleeves were definitely too large. The bottom part of the arm pit stuck out from the shape of the silluete. It had to be be fix with a hit of tailoring but the colors are beautiful and the material very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"He is quite chunky, so it was a tight fit but would have worked.  I tried them on him (my grandson) when he was beginning to crawl for the grab effect.  They lost them......so he is now almost walking and I ordered the foam mats for him to crawl on and fall on in their living room which has hard wood floors.  They are working great."
4.0,Son loves it. He wears all the time. We have to hid to keep rotation going. Washes well.
4.0,works well takes th edge off night driving
4.0,"At 5'9&#34; this was slightly short, but I'm used to that. Leggings with it is perfect! Nicely cut dress, well made."
4.0,"The top fits a bit weird but, I will make it work. I wish the white part wasn‚Äôt so see through. I definitely have to get a slip to go under it"
4.0,Cute. Server it‚Äôs purpose. Soft. Not a fan of the ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel to the fabric. The fit was good. Tie the string before you wash them. I had to put the string back through the hole afterwards.
4.0,It is a very nice dress for the price. It is very stretchy and firgiving.
4.0,"I really like the minimal looking watches, but I could never justify the price tag of a nice one because I know I wouldn't wear it enough. I bought this one just to wear once in awhile and its just what I was looking for. I have rather large wrists (8-8.5""), and this still fits nicely, which I was pleasantly surprised about. The face is a nice size that I think would flatter a lot of sized frames. The strap is not the highest quality, but it looks nice so far and the watch isn't that expensive. It most definitely meets my expectations. Would recommend!"
4.0,"Dress was too long, at 5'6'', there was about 6 inches pooling even in heels."
4.0,Was nice.  Material was soft and was what I expected.
4.0,Just what I needed for a formal event. Very comfortable!
4.0,It‚Äôs good!! I didn‚Äôt really like the material of it but is draco
4.0,"I like this jacket. I'm 5'8&#34; athletic build, 160 lbs, usually wear M so I bought the M but is much wider and roomier at the midsection/bottom/hips than necessary even for athletic activities, but sleeve length and bust were no problem. You can tighten the hem so it's fine. It's so lightweight yet works as a windbreaker too. You can compact it down to nearly nothing so packing it anywhere is no problem. The colors are vibrant and exactly as pictured. Great price for a good jacket. It will keep you cool when hot and warm on crisp mornings. Dries easily, breathable, and I couldn't even tell I was hot and sweating when wearing it through a 3 day/2 nights backpacking trip in the Cascades."
4.0,Thick leather and easy to buckle!
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my husband and he is happy with it. Good size and weight.
4.0,"This was a little on the small side, however, I love it!"
4.0,Not what i was expecting material is real thin but it fits my kid just right
4.0,The head wrap is very vibrant and great quality but it is made from what feels like wax plastic on  opposite side. It is way too  stiff to wrap with. Not what I was  looking for. I would prefer to buy from  JOANN Fabric and Craft Store<br /> or Walmart.
4.0,"100% knit, sorta like a sweater but it‚Äôs not thick to where it would be hot. I have an hourglass figure with DD chest and it‚Äôs so cute on. Doesn‚Äôt show too much cleavage and it‚Äôs not too tight across the chest. I‚Äôm a 6/8 and 5‚Äô8‚Äù and the large fit perfectly. It hits mid-thigh, about 2-3 inches below my finger tips. Has sort of a flare to it, too."
4.0,"I ordered three different sizes of these earrings (5mm, 4mm, 3mm).  They are very bright and sparkly.  The third set I purchased, the 4mm, had one pair of earrings that did not match each other.  I think it is the purple pair -- one is much lighter than the other.  Also, among the three sets I bought, one of them did not have the reddish color, but instead had a pumpkin orange color.  They are very nice earrings for the price, however, and I am glad I purchased them."
4.0,"Fuzzed abs beaded up after a few washings, so looks kind of rough, but still soft."
4.0,"Works as claimed. Very fast delivery. Oiled hat, used hair dryer to help with coating, left overnight.  Next day, all dry areas were now watertight. Have worn 3 times in a driving rain and inside is totally dry. Does indeed shed water like a duck's back, and much easier than trying to make some home brew concoction. Enough in that little container to keep hat dry for the next 10 years."
4.0,"Pretty, not to flashy. Nice color and enough sparkle"
4.0,"True to size and a perfect fit for basketball.  I was expecting the fabric to have more of a synthetic feel, but it feels like cotton."
4.0,"These snow pants are great material but don't size properly. It says these are women's snow pants, so I ordered a Large and it is way too tall for me. So maybe buy closer to men's sizing.<br /><br />Besides the sizing, I really like the material and the soft lining in the pockets. The straps are a nice elastic with easy-to-use clips. There are zippers on the bottom of the pants to help wrap around snow boots and also a zipper around the side of the stomach to help form fit snugly around the body. These pants really are a great fit, but better suited for my husband than me."
4.0,"Nice shoes, but small compared to the rest of Timberland's line."
4.0,"Very pleased with Zeta Socks , they feel good on my legs , the material is well made , they do help my circulation. I will recommend Zeta Socks to all my family and friends."
4.0,Hard to adjust the wristband.
4.0,"I ordered one size up (usually a M, ordered a L) fits nicely. Beautiful dress, just like the picture.  My one complaint is that it is very short waisted, I am 5'9&#34;, but it is a little awkward in the torso area. Very thin material"
4.0,"I originally ordered these for the fun/cute factor...Now that I actually have them, I can tell you thery're both!!! I was so sure they weren't going to fit because I ordered my regular size (med)..Then I read the sizing information...Honestly though, everyone's right, I'm sure I could've gotten away with a small...Who knew??? üòè Now that I'm no longer stressed about size, I'm going back and order in purple!!! FYI: Customer service was 100%...I'm still not quite sure why they call them crotchless?<br /><br />Update: After wearing these for  one night while sleeping, I felt the need to change my rating from a five to a four...Why? The lace came loose on both sides around the bottom...and yes, I mean sleeping not &#34;sleeping&#34;!üòè I would understand this more if they were too tight, but as I said previously, theyre actually a little too big!"
4.0,It fits to a t and it's a great little casual dress!
4.0,I don‚Äôt like brown on it but I took brown off it and look better without brown
4.0,This dress is long on because I‚Äôm 5 ft 4. But it feels great. Kind of see through in the chest area but that‚Äôs ok. It was more than what I was expecting really.
4.0,I was delighted to find this. This was purchased as a gift for my brother in law who is part of a train preservation society. He will enjoy this for years to come. Will get another one for my mother's brother later this year.
4.0,"The band worked out great. Resizing it was easy, and it hasn't loosened up at all. My only complaint is that less than a month later, the color is already fading on parts of the band."
4.0,Exactly as shown!
4.0,I ordered a medium based off my sizing but i think a small or extra small would have been better. Still super cute but the mesh sleeves can look awkward at times
4.0,"The sunglasses are great. Hands down, great. I get so many compliments on them, it's awesome. The look is different from your typical sunglasses, so, it'll be sure to catch people's attention (In a good way). They actually shade your eyes from the sun very well! Summer is coming up, so, get your pair soon!<br />I gave these a 4 star only because they need more sizes! Thankfully, mine fit me perfect, as they seem to a be a one size fits all. However, these are so great that ANYONE should be able to wear these comfortably true to their size! üôÇ"
4.0,"Really cute, festive."
4.0,"I'm size 11 and 1/2 shoe. This shoe is comfortable, but because it is loose, I'm hesitant to wear it out of the house."
4.0,It‚Äôs great but runs Very BIG
4.0,"I bought the xxl after reading reviews and probably should have just bought the xl. Sleeves are a bit long. Cute design, material is not to thin. I don‚Äôt like my dresses to be to fitted since I have a little tummy. I like it a lot and have got compliments when wearing it. I bought the cranberry with floral print."
4.0,This is a pretty sweater and will go with many things in my closet. Glad I got it.
4.0,"By the time it got to me, some stones were missing.  It was not packaged very well.  It's very pretty; but I can only suggest wearing it for a short time and wash it to avoid oil and dirt setting on it.  Not quite sure of the material.  But, &#34;long lasting, great quality&#34; aren't my first choice of words to describe the craftsmanship.<br /><br />Again,<br />Once or twice for a special, yes.  But, definitely not a set that I would recommend to someone with sensitive skin."
4.0,The sleeve size doesn't match the burst size
4.0,The dress was like the picture material was not too think ... i did not like the closure around the neckline. overall great dress for the price
4.0,"I love the cap, but was a bit upset that it arrived with two of the major crystals missing. I found them in the box and was able to replace them, and tighten many of the others.For the price, I would have hoped to see better quality. The cap itself is pretty stunning:-)"
4.0,"Works as described, very robust. A little on the small side."
4.0,"Cute dress. I intend to wear it as beach dress- or casual out to dinner dress in Hawaii. It‚Äôs really quite well made- good color of blue( not really navy). I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it was long on me.  I will just shorten it by hand. I sometimes wear a Small, sometimes a Med. (126 lbs) This dress is a small- wish I had a Med., but not a big deal."
4.0,"Arrived in a different color than the one I chose. Material is thin , but it fit well."
4.0,"If these were a bit thicker, they would be very good.  If you wear a headlamp, this won't keep the imprint off your head.<br /><br />I sweat a lot when running (live in the Dallas area) and have to wring these out more often than Halo IIs.  The price is very good and they definitely help with sweat which is why I am giving them a 4 star rating"
4.0,Nice looking watch. It's a gift for someone. Seems sturdy.
4.0,"Fun, pretty durable, but hard to wear for a long time."
4.0,Pretty and true to photo advertisement.
4.0,"This is a pretty bag and looks like I paid more for it. You know it's nice when you have five granddaughters who say what they mean. I only gave it four stars because I wish the opening was a little wider at the top. Other than that, it holds everything really well and the bag itself doesn't add much weight. Hope the straps hold up. Love it, so far."
4.0,"It's really cute and the straps are fully adjustable. You get to tie the straps in the back to the length that fits, which is handy when your toddler is growing fast. I took one star off because I thought the fabric is a little bit stiff and could be softer."
4.0,Me encanto es igual que en la foto
4.0,"purchased the grey and the white, fit is good, clean up nice,  only thing i ran into was that the white are longer then the grey for me anyway."
4.0,"This is the closest to a Carhartt hoodie you can get, for one third of the price. Solid hoodie, fits true to size. Zipper is YKK, hood is roomy, it‚Äôs a solid hoodie all around. I don‚Äôt need a super thick warm hoodie in California, the material is just right for the weather on any given cold day."
4.0,So soft jus5 buy them ....True to size<br />I take2x
4.0,Didn't care for material
4.0,Only problem I couldn't keep it on my head. Head
4.0,"+  Super warm. These arrived in time for Tahoe's coldest day of the season. They are very warm, the cuff goes to mid-forearm to keep out snow and wind; straps to around your wrist so you don't drop and lose them if you take them off on a chair lift.<br /><br />- bulky especially in the palms so it's awkward to grip and hold poles.  Perhaps this is the tradeoff for the warmth."
4.0,I would have given this cute little dress 5 stars but I'm not sure how to wear a bra with this?
4.0,"This is a very nice bracelet and fit perfectly.  I like copper because it is antimicrobial and some say it helps with inflammation and arthritis.  It was packaged nicely and even enclosed in a plastic bag BUT it was quite tarnished.  I covered it with ketchup, which is good for cleaning copper, and it polished up beautifully."
4.0,Given to my son cotton.
4.0,"Everything fit - I think.  We'll see what happens when I have to take it out of the house.  The bag I had been carrying had more outside pockets and I loved it, but it was 15 years old, so it needed to be retired.  Hope this is as good."
4.0,"The only down side to this dress is that the straps aren't adjustable and are a bit too long, so I have to wear a tank top under it or I'd be giving the world a show. Otherwise it fits, and I do love it. Very comfy!"
4.0,"The Black Velvet Ribbon Gothic Choker Necklaces are so so cute. I got this pair for my two Grand Daughters for Christmas. They love wearing choker style necklaces and love the goth look. These are going to look great on them. The little fur ball embellishment adds softness along with the black velvet ribbon. They measures about 0.7 Inch and the length is a hair over 13 & 1/2 Inches  it also has a  2.5&#34; extender chain, so it fits a nice range of sizes. They will go with just about any outfit because of their simplistic design. They have a lobster clasp closure which are my choice of closures when I'm making necklaces because they are so reliable. I am 100% satisfied with these necklaces!<br /><br />**  I'm a non payed reviewer and get offers for free or discounted products to review.

4.0,"Chain is a little short, but other wise it's beautiful"
4.0,Fit great but the legs were to short.
4.0,I love pigs and saw these on the site.  They fit as expected and are real cute. I would order from them again.
4.0,the dress looks just as pictured. fits true to size.
4.0,Love this hat. Very light weight Buick drying. Will be ordering more colors soon.
4.0,"I purchased these specifically for shopping at Aldi's, a grocery store that does not use bags.  This has made shopping trips much easier as things are organized.  The bags are high quality and durable even with heavy groceries.  The handles make them easy to pick up and carry.  They fit great in the shopping cart.  They fold down easily to store in your car or carry into the store.  The shipping was slow, but I knew that it would be before I ordered as they aren't prime.<br /><br />As for the negative, when you put them in the car the sides fall down so your things in bags are no longer in bags.  So you need to re-bag at your car or have groceries rolling around the trunk.  Also the fabric is rather thin, but after one trip it has held up great.  If I have issues with it after extended use I will update my review to include that.<br /><br />I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I like these and I am glad that I purchased them.  I would recommend these for shopping.  I like that they are environmentally friendly.  If you shop at a place like Aldi without bags these are a great thing to have!"
4.0,"as someone who isnt in love with bikinis or one-pieces, this middle ground hit the spot. covering enough but also still being sexy this is a perfect suit. I'm 5'5 145 and i do wish Id gotten a size larger as it looks good, but the straps push in on my skin a little (or maybe I'm just squishy)"
4.0,Great sparkles!
4.0,"I sized up.  Bought large; fit 114 lbs 5'3"""
4.0,This masks was beautiful on my daughter.
4.0,"They are great, I wasn't fond of the bow and removed them and the bell. It was simple and didn't damage the ears. If you want to place only the bell back on in a different spot, my daughter sewed hers on and I glued mine. Both worked but the sewing gives you more of a jingle. Great quality!"
4.0,Usually a medium but had to size down. It‚Äôs super flattering and doesn‚Äôt look like an amazon clothing find.
4.0,I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! Great buy and good quality!
4.0,This is a nice summer dress. My only issue is how rough and scratchy the material is. The style and colors are great.
4.0,this head piece is really nice and does not pinch or get tangled in my hair. It also does not give me headaches
4.0,This was a gift for a friend. He loved it. Good price. Good quality. Good message.
4.0,Liked the colors and packaging
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:80402bf82cc43da1821e25d7d4693f11]] The set is cute and I do like that it‚Äôs a little thick, I‚Äôm a S , I got a M I need room for my back side to breath :) so the waist area is a bit big because of it. Other then that happy with it :) I read comments to set up that helped :)"
4.0,Finally got use out of those too short shirts and sweaters
4.0,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. The top is very, very warm - that is good for some people but not so much for me. I had to shorten the pants 6 inches, but he probably did not order a petite. It seems to be good quality....it just doesn't work so much for me (don't tell him I said that)."
4.0,Followed the size chart & it fits perfectly!<br />The fabric and color was just like the pic!
4.0,It looks beautiful.  It is a Christmas gift for a friend.
4.0,I love how well this leotard covers.  It‚Äôs design does not let it gape in the front or fall off shoulders.  It‚Äôs fit is great and the color is a deep yellow!!  Perfect for our fancy Nancy party!  The material however is kind of disturbing.  Not really sure what it is but it feels like the rubber masks you buy at Halloween!!  So weird!!  I prefer cotton or spandex but other than that it was great!
4.0,The hat is nice. It's adjustable. The brim is a nice proportion. The hat arrived in a plasti manufacturing bag. There was a strong chemical smell on the hat. It was causing nausea and headaches. I stopped allowing my child to wear it.
4.0,I really liked the size and look of these earrings when I received them. They were exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"I ordered this set in the orange so the tags would be nice and bright and easy to see at baggage claim.  They definitely are!  While they arrived bent, it's nothing too bad and they do seem pretty sturdy overall."
4.0,"I really love these earrings alot! I've always liked weird earrings! The only problem I have is that they're alot bigger and heavier than I thought they'd be. But other than that, I'd definitely recommend these if you like em!"
4.0,belt is too high on waist otherwise nice light weight robe
4.0,I bought it for someone.<br />She like it so far.
4.0,gives you the moonchild vibes you've been craving
4.0,Nice for the money but does lose the stones after a while.
4.0,"I thought it would be darker - for some reason I was expecting more of a brownish-black, but it's a very nice shade of brown/cordovan. Very thick and feels sturdy, and will definitely require some breaking in. The fit with the Apple Watch is great. All in all, a very nice band."
4.0,Perfect for hot yoga! Not see through :)
4.0,"Great fit through sleeves, chest, and arms."
4.0,BUY THE NEXT SIZE UP! The description says to buy a larger size which I ignored. It definitely runs a little small. I'm 5'10 180lbs...a large was just a little snug in the chest and armpits. Overall a great jacket. Green color is accurate with the photo. Zipped pockets work well plus it has two inside. It's lightweight but has some insulation for the cold windy days. You can't beat it for the price...pick one up!
4.0,"I love Yoshi, so this wallet was perfect.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />Adorable Yoshi picture<br />Slim and isn't bulgey in my purse or coat pocket.<br />Perfect for holding my cash<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />Not enough card holders for the amount of cards I have.<br />My last picture is of the clasp. I had over filled the wallet and the white outer part of the wallet busted out. I was able to glue it back down without any noticble imperfections. I recommend being careful not to push the amount it can hold to prevent tearing.<br /><br />Overall, I still love this wallet after having it for about a year"
4.0,i really like it alots i wear it every day at work
4.0,"I love these but the zipper rubs immediately on my ankle and it is terrible.  I wish they fit, not even socks keep it from rubbing wish I had returned in time."
4.0,"Love all the 90 degree reflex products, always true to size and very comfy. This particular pair was not tight toward my ankles but around the rest of<br />The pant, which makes it feel a little strange"
4.0,Great for my leather vest! Not so much for a fez!
4.0,"Cool bracelets. The clasp holds, not flimsy. I only buy bracelets with this kind of clasp as it is easy to put on and it holds."
4.0,Gorgeous dress. very good quality. Little long for me. I ordered large and i am 5 feet. I love the dress. very comfortable. I am definitely buying one more for my  sister.
4.0,Material is a little thin but I wear a sheer jacket over it
4.0,"Definitely soft and warm but the zipper is pretty sucky, it does work but it takes some messing around with it. Fit is nice but there's a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area which looks a bit odd but wearing it with a long shirt solves it!"
4.0,"Love it, very comfortable and wrinkle free.  Just ordered a couple more."
4.0,"For the price, this necklace looks great. I haven't worn it yet so I can't review the durability"
4.0,"They work. I was looking for tank tops to use as layers. These are mid weight, super stretchy, razor back tanks. I just wish they were 3‚Äù longer to stay tucked into my pants!"
4.0,Fits as expected. Keeps its shape. Not as soft as I was hoping.
4.0,Think if it as a sheer beach or pool cover up. I love it!
4.0,"I‚Äôve been riding for years, but never had a cycling cap.  I‚Äôve always used Headsweats head covers to try to wick away sweat.  Recently. I decided to give this a try. It is a little more snug than I would choose, but still works well.  The bill also comes in handy for blocking low sun and drizzle.  I‚Äôve already ordered more of these."
4.0,Mom loved these gloves and found them very stylish.
4.0,"This dress is okay.  It did look slightly different than the photo but it is still a cute dress. It is somewhat small so I suggest ordering a size up. The material is somewhat this but very stretchy.  This would be a good dress to wear on those hot summer nights out on the town. The material will come in handy on those days, you can keep cool and be cute while doing it.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Love the style.  Just as described and pictured.  However...UPDATE: RECEIVED REPLACEMENT AND NO LOOSE THREADS BUT STILL SALMON COLOR AND NOT PINK.<br />CONT' mine arrived instead of being pink it is Salmon color AND loose thread everywhere. As you can see in the first photo.  The Salmon color doesn't show well in the first photo but the second photo is of knots in the material they used to make the blouse...there you can see the color perfectly.  You can't confuse salmon with pink and say it was a screen resolution error.  They called it pink...not salmon or orange.  VERY ANGRY.  I am exchanging it for the exact same.  Which is all you are allowed to do.  Not happy about that either.  BUT I will take a picture of that.  I HOPE it comes in pink and if there are any loose thread , I just hope it isn't in the lace where it pulls out the lace design this time.  All in All Very disappointed.  Would be no stars if it didn't fit perfectly to the measurements the seller listed and matched the design perfectly.  It is a beautiful blouse.  Of course it has a chemical stink to it which doesn't bother me as it washes out.  OH how I wanted the Dusty Pink that was shown and NAMED  I will update..."
4.0,Cute.  Very thin material.  Didn't last more than a few washes.
4.0,"nice coat, looks more like a cold weather coat but is more a fall coat"
4.0,I have to edit my review. It did say in product description that charger has to be bought separately. It's still smaller than my size. I ordered 1 size up but it's their biggest size. I suggest that you order 2 size up. I'm not returning it coz I like it. Rate 4 stars because they don't have bigger size.
4.0,"Very nice gloves, they have definitely come in handy while I was carving wood. They fit well and protected my hands and were comfortable. I don't have much to compare it to but these are the best I've had so far."
4.0,"These earrings are good, but they were a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I ended up giving them to my mom."
4.0,"The floral print is quite adorable. The fit is better than I expected for a cheaper dress. It was a bit tight in the arms just below my shoulders but manageable for the price. I ordered an XL and typically wear 14/16 in US women's sizing and am large chested. I did not notice that the fabric was sheer as some reviewers mentioned. I did get a defective pocket on side where the stitching closed the pocket in the middle, but for $20ish it's not worth the hassle of returning. Overall, a decent dress for the price!"
4.0,It is very comfortable and easy to use. Very glad I tried it. Will probably purchase a new one in the near future.
4.0,Nice quality for the price. It‚Äôs what I was hoping for.
4.0,The back doesnt fit well. Kinda tight in chest area. Order size up.
4.0,"Needs more absorption/retention capacity.  If it is hot and you are working hard, this sweatband needs to be replaced frequently."
4.0,No problems so far after 3 months use. Feels comfortable. I wear my watch daily for work.
4.0,"Love the arm sleeve! Big Waffle House fan and it always gets a great reaction. Giving 4 instead of 5, it could be a little more snug on my arm. I am a Slim man so should be perfect for most."
4.0,"Great size, love the cross odd, my only complaint is the snap on the front pocket will not stay snapped. That makes the pocket not too useful."
4.0,Really pretty. But it runs big and long. I should have ordered 1 size smaller. The holes for your arms are really big and It will need to be hemmed.
4.0,They ran a tad bit smaller than I was hoping. I normally wear a 6 and/or mediums. These ran a bit smaller but larges would have been to big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 145lbs.<br />The part where the bottom is to latch into was seen shut but easy fix with a pair of sudore. Overall I like the shorts and not bad price.
4.0,Very cute for my 6year old grand daughter.
4.0,"I took two pictures: one with the flash and one without. I love the size of the ring (not overbearing), but I'm not sure about the quality of the sapphire. It's still pretty. Also, it didn't come in a box. It was in a little baggie inside of a mailing envelope. Super weird."
4.0,love this bag !!
4.0,"Very inexpensive, excellent necklace and pendant.... The price, shipping time and customer service were all excellent but I still found necklace too big and gaudy looking to wear in public. If you don't care what people think then you will probably like and wear this everywhere. Great, low price, though."
4.0,"I really like this brand.  I previously bought the anatomax 9&#34;.  The pouch on these may be just a bit small, but it stretches out and the underwear are comfortable.  I say that these run a bit small only because the Medium is supposed to be for a 32-34&#34; waist.  I was a 33-34&#34;waist in jeans 2 years ago when I first purchased this brand underwear in a medium.  I was about 210 pounds then. I felt like they fit very well  Since that time; I lost nearly 40 pounds. I now wear a size 31&#34; waist in jeans.  A 32&#34; is much too big and I can even wear some 30&#34; pants.  I STILL feel like the medium fit me great at 175 pounds. I'm pretty certain the small would feel too small.  I'm not skinny and have a relatively muscular build.  Im not a really big guy and at 6'1&#34;, 175 pounds, wearing a 31&#34; waist pants...the small should be my size according to waist measurement listed on the underwear,  but the mediums FIT...they are not loose at all, anywhere.  As for the underwear itself:  The anatomax 9&#34; are the most  comfortable I've purchased. These are close. Nice soft fabric, comfortable waist band, keep stuff from between one's legs very well, ALL day comfort.  One complaint really, I like the waistband closer to my WAIST.  The anatomax are kind of low...these are REALLY low.  I'll deal with it but will be going back to the anatomax 9&#34;."
4.0,I love the soft fabric and the cut is cute but it‚Äôs thin. I‚Äôll need a slip underneath but I like it so I‚Äôll keep it.
4.0,very nice my daughter like it
4.0,[[VIDEOID:80d1d0a5243ab2466948a4b9bf96e1b]] Hi guys<br />I want to share my experience with you about this jumpsuit.<br />Good points:<br />1.it‚Äôs cute<br />2.it‚Äôs soft and comfortable<br />3.it fits good and true size<br />4.everything is like the picture<br />Bad points:<br />1.style is not that good
4.0,Love these leggings. Wish they wernt see through is my only issue with them.
4.0,"Love the light material, I got an xx large for my boyfriend who is very skinny and tall, it was little short for how he likes to wear sweatshirts."
4.0,"The boots are really cute but very large around the calf area. I ordered my orginal size. I did wear them with a skirt, maybe if I wear them with pants they might fit a little better? Overall, I will continue to wear because I do like them. I just wish they were a little tighter around the calves"
4.0,I liked the style And the color. But I am a little bigger up top and I don't like things that are snug. I am 5'4 a 155 pounds and I bought an extra large. .
4.0,XXL fits great not too tight or too loose. It‚Äôs a tighter athletic fit without being restrictive. Good looking tee!
4.0,"I like the feel of this dress. The material is like a thin flannel that has a bit of a sateen, stretchy quality to it. It's not quite at tailored at the waist as it appears to be in the product listing, but it's comfortable to wear and looks good."
4.0,"Perches a little high on my head, but the yellow/tan color is very nice and the styling is great.  A bit of a plastic feel to it, was hoping for the kind made of paper, but it has the same look.  The white one was a little too small for my head and was crushed when I received it, but the vendor is replacing it so, I'm good."
4.0,This is a very nice bag well-made. It is quite large very roomy.  My only issue with it is unless it‚Äôs completely full it tends to fall sideways. Other than that it‚Äôs a great bag and I would recommend it
4.0,My 11 year old loved this dress.
4.0,"Cute Chinese New Year Themed earrings. The pearls hair clipper that came with it is adorable too! For such a cheap price, it‚Äôs well worth."
4.0,It was a hit. The smell was over welming. Made my whole room smell like felmeldhide to strong everyone liked them fit well . Why was the smell so strong?
4.0,Perfect compliment to my outfit gave it just the right sparkle.
4.0,"I like the design of this dress.  The material is very stretchy which is good for hugging your curves, and mobility.  Being that the material is so stretchy, It's thin. You'll have to plan your undergarments with this one. It's not see through, but its not forgiving. I am a size 10, 36 DD,  5'3&#34; and ordered the medium.  I had to wear a belt to stop the dress from shifting around. Another drawback, the black band at the bottom of the dress is a little snug, making it ride up when walking.  The dress is already on the short side, it made for an interesting day."
4.0,She like them and they have held up well
4.0,"nice quality but cheap looking. i was looking for a good knock off, but this just wasn't the right fit. better off buying one more expensive."
4.0,"I like it, just the metal junction is a little bit sharp."
4.0,"too small for A4 paper sheets, but my wife likes it anyway"
4.0,a bit shorter than some of the others but very nice
4.0,The hat is very nice however yellow isn't really my color. Would have liked to have a selection of diff c
4.0,"more than $ 10, I would not take. Beautiful"
4.0,Cute socks for a good price. My daughter has size 9 feet and these fit a little small on her.
4.0,"For a discounted cosplay outfit, it's very cute, besides the fact that it doesn't come with a moon on the choker and the gloves are way too small. Also, the dress is a little tight and I think the crinalin under the skirt makes it fit a little awkwardly on the backside. I also think the ribbons could have been done a little better, but overall, it's adorable and a great bargain."
4.0,The material is super soft! This is a very casual & comfortable addition to my bedtime pieces.
4.0,They fit well and stay put. The look good.  Only issue I had was they are really sharp and hurt my lower lip!
4.0,"I love this ring so much i wear it all the time! I have had mine for over 6 months now and i have noticed it has started changing color a little, but for the price it‚Äôs to be expected. I just apply clear nail polish on all of my rings that tarnish. It makes them last longer. But overall it‚Äôs as described and i love wearing it!"
4.0,"This is excellent for the price. It is a bit smaller in the bust than I anticipated, so large-breasted women may want to order a size bigger. However, this is lovely for the price!"
4.0,Cute but thin. The bow one you have to tie yourself and it doesn't look cute when you put it in a bow.
4.0,"Very nice quality, but runs small. Will need to be returned"
4.0,"Besides the post man literally throwing the box at my door before running back to the truck, the watch is in perfect condition and very beautiful! I havent wound it yet since its an xmas gift but Im sure my boyfriend is going to love it."
4.0,Dress is fun and I always get compliments when I wear it.  Good quality and comfortable.
4.0,I like the product. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the earrings  coming unlatched. They are very comfortable to wear.
4.0,Bought this for my Sister who is a huge Dragonfly fan and she loved it. I thought it could have been a little larger for the price but all in all it was very nice piece. Built well and I think it will definitely hold up and last.
4.0,"Good design with Zipper which can be unzipped from bottom, easier to sit...<br />Could be warmer too but overall a great buy."
4.0,Beautiful colors. I‚Äôm short waisted so it fit ‚Äúlong‚Äù  with excess material in the crouch. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and bought a small. Overall great buy.
4.0,Perfect for travel. Love the hidden zipper compartment.<br />Hide important docs or Wallet.
4.0,I liked the dress very much it just didn‚Äôt fit me properly the chest was to tight and when I went up a size it was to loose The color and pattern are lovely I wished I could have gotten to fit
4.0,"Very cute, bright, I felt like a bee in it. I wish they offered this in other colors"
4.0,They fit my 5 year old grandson well. He has small feet and they were just right. He will probably grow it of them soon.
4.0,Comfortable.  Not as comfortable as another pair of shoes I own.  But good backup shoes so I am not wearing my other pair everyday.  I work 10 hrs a day in a warehouse environment.  So my feet a shoes get a workout and a little beat up.  So far they are holding up
4.0,size down when you order other than that very good shirt
4.0,"People mentioned that this runs small, so I ordered a large. I should have ordered a medium, and maybe even a small, as it's too big and also it's extremely long! I am 5'7&#34;, my waist belly button level is about 28 1/2-29 & the large is a good inch or two too big- also, while I like dresses and skirts long for when I wear heels, but this one is more suited for ladies upwards of 5'9&#34; who plan to also wear heels, as on me, even in heels, it's dragging on the floor.."
4.0,"These are very cute and lightweight, although fairly large, earrings. The only problem I had is that they seemed to have been glued onto the post with hot glue, and all four were unattached when they arrived. I used superglue to glue them back together, and I hope they will stay together s"
4.0,It is vomfortable and colotful. I recieved many complements.
4.0,"This skirt is a mauve color, it is pleated which is all the rage right now. It has the leopard print design on one side of the pleat. So from one angle you see mostly the mauve color and from another angle you see more leopard print. it is a velvety type material and has an elastic waist. The waist band has the extra feature of having two lines all the way around, that are a slight sparkle look, to give it a little bit of a classy design over being just plain black elastic. Several different sizes could wear this. The size is Large which I wear and it fits me but I almost wish I had a medium. So I think good two sizes bigger than me could wear this with no problem. Over all it seems to be decent material."
4.0,"It's a very pretty kimono, it's a little longer than I like, that's the only reason it didn't get a 5 star."
4.0,Nice I really like it
4.0,"So these masks are single ply, but easily can be folded in half to make it two layers. Disappointed that the bottom edges are not sewn/hemmed. It's a little loose on me, so I wear it over my hair to make it a little tighter. Prints and colors are vibrant."
4.0,"I love the way this was packaged, however it does look cheap. The necklaces are two separate ones so you can wear one at a time. Length was good, chains are very thick! Great gold tone."
4.0,"I wear a L/10-12 normally. I ordered a L in this and it's very big. I wanted a loose night shirt, but this is too much. I am returning for a medium. The fabric is very soft. It's not too heavy, but it's not sheer. Hem comes to the knee."
4.0,I ordered the wrong size so it fits me a little loose you guys didn't have my size on the site they were all sold out
4.0,Not exactly like the photo but close. Perfect for Joe Exotic. Much longer than the picture. Had to cut a lot off.
4.0,"I got ordered this for a formal dinner with my husband, and it came in as expected. I am 5'6&#34; and ~115lbs and the small fit fine."
4.0,"I liked this dress but the arm area will not stay up on my arm, the elastic is to big, I think I will have to get that part altered but the overall dress is beautiful and looks very classy professional"
4.0,"I really do like the Happy Sailed Women Batwing Ribbed Dolman Blouse Tshirt  however, for me, it runs large.  I normally wear a size 12 or L top but based on the size chart and other reviewers indicating it ran small, I ordered the XXL (which did seem a bit odd to me).  I can wear it as is, but like I said, it is big so I'm going to wash it and run it in through the dryer in hopes that it might shrink a little.  The material is very nice and the gathering in the waist cinches nicely giving it a flattering shape.  The &#34;bat wing&#34; sleeves also add to the attractiveness of this blouse.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for an honest review.

4.0,He loves them ! My grandson
4.0,Pretty good. Looking forward to this year's Halloween. Its going to be different but my kids lobe the bag.
4.0,nothing wrong with them. oversized for sure. they look pretty cool
4.0,"Very shiny and pretty. I love delicate jewelry, which is how I would describe this ring. Great fit!"
4.0,Perfect fit and just want I wanted.
4.0,"Ordered xl and too big, but overall it‚Äôs a great dress"
4.0,"It's very large, but is beatiful."
4.0,"Got a pair of these for Christmas. Have not tried them outdoors yet, but wore around the house. Nice and warm and the actually fit my size 12 wide feet over a pair of coolmax liner socks. If they were a little wider, they'd be perfect. Can't wait to camp with them."
4.0,I like them just not true to size
4.0,for the price. no complaints.
4.0,"My GF whom I bought this for as a present loved it, both the colour and the saying."
4.0,"I bought this to use as a fake wedding ring since I'm pregnant and my fingers are a little swollen for my normal wedding ring.  You can't beat the price and the ring is very pretty in person.  It sparkles and I love the rose gold.  To me it still looks fake as the main stone is pretty large, but this is an awesome ring that I keep planning to wear (on my other hand) after my pregnancy."
4.0,Haven't used it much but very nice. It's my nice clothes wallet on special occasions.
4.0,"I massively hyper-extended my left ring finger last month. The doctor had to cut off my wedding ring. It had left me feeling bare and like I had a ghost limb. I found this and within minutes, I felt better. It's somewhat petty, but this ring did the job of helping me mentally and physically- it actually helps with stability, too. For this price, thank you! Edited- it does tend to snag and the top of one of the stones came off."
4.0,I sure enjoy wearing it.
4.0,This is a pretty dress. I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly in top but I didn‚Äôt like the bottom. I wanted more of a tighter look around my butt area. It was just to loose . But over it‚Äôs still beautiful.
4.0,I really love theses earrings. They are gorgeous. Only issue I experienced is one of the clasp of one earring had stopped working after a few uses. Hopefully the 5/6 remaining earrings continue to close properly or I would have to change my review.
4.0,"The sandals fit true to size. They are better suited for narrower feet. They are decently made. The sole is glued, the straps are sewn through. The straps on the sides have stretchy band if you do not want to use them since there is a zipper in the back. It's a bit of a hassle to put on since my girl's foot is thick and every strap needs to be adjusted, that's how I know it would be more comfortable for narrower feet. She says she is comfortable in them but I see how the straps stretch on her feet. One season hopefully."
4.0,"This crop top is super cute, but the bulk of the pretty pattern is on the inside of the shirt. It‚Äôs still pretty, but it would have been nicer to have more of the pattern on the visible side."
4.0,"Arrived quickly! Cute shirt for New Years Eve! I ordered the M in silver. Fit great although it is a tad bit short, but it will work. I am wearing underneath my leather jacket. Also the silver isn‚Äôt really shiny, it‚Äôs more of a matte but does have some sparkly to it. Overall I like it. :)<br /><br />For reference on the ‚ÄúM‚Äù size. I‚Äôm 5.5, weigh about 155 and a 34C."
4.0,Nice casual skirt. Fits well. Tapered around the knee. Like oks good.
4.0,"These are super comfy sandals & the smooth black leather looks great. My only complaint would be they are a bit loose, but I will just tighten the straps. Would definitely buy again, especially for the price."
4.0,It's a little clunky. It rides up to high. But all in all it's a good mask
4.0,"My daughter took this blazer as soon as it arrived.  She said it was nice enough for work but also casual enough for hanging out with friends.  She tried it on and it looked great on her! The fabric is soft and lightweight.  It is made from 100% polyester but it feels like a rayon material.  The cut was true to size and the material was free from imperfections. Overall, very nice blazer that will match multiple occasions!"
4.0,The material of the coat looks like microfiber. It has soft fur inside the jacket. It has a hood and a drawstring at the waist. It has pockets on each side. The length comes to the middle of my thigh. I like this jacket because it has a hood so when it's snowing at least my head will be covered and warm. Not too heavy.
4.0,"Nice watch, just difficult to adjust. My niece did it for me. The only thing that's strange is that on the instruction sheet it says it has the hour hand, minute hand and seconds hand but mine only has the hour and minute one which looks a bit off. On the pictures some have two and others have the three.<br />Also, I bought the rose gold with black and wish the bracelet was rose gold instead of plain gold to better match while wearing together but great for gifting and looks of excellent quality. We'll see how long it lasts as I just opened it."
4.0,Very cute - well made - wires are a bit short and did not come with backs - must have so not to lose them..
4.0,"This said large but was like a size 18 and not a 16. I also did not expect the material to be so thick, though I normally don't complain about thick material. This is for the winter time."
4.0,"Love, love, love this dress. Really versatile. I will say that I didn't see much of a batwing in the sleeve area; the top was basically just cut like a baggy t-shirt but the bottom was gathered as pictured. That being said, I am really pleased with this purchase  and you can't beat the price."
4.0,"It's nice to find quality earrings available in a bright color. These are very pretty and the silver backing keeps them from the wear nickel gets, however you should try to clean them regularly as silver tends to fade and tarnish over time. They are a good price. I'd recommend making sure you get the right diameter too because the 2.5mm are pretty small."
4.0,"I loved the styled of this watch and would recommend it for a dress watch if you have large arms/wrists.  I also really liked the different strap options.  I did not look at a measure (metric ruler) to see how big this watch really was.  I really wanted to keep the watch, but ended up sending it back because it was just too big."
4.0,My fianc√© and I took our engagement photos and I wore this dress I loved it a little see through out it was okay!
4.0,Perfect set for my bridesmaids! Very sparkly and will look great with their dresses!
4.0,Gave it as a teacher gift and she loved it.
4.0,This is a decent zip up. I bought them for my husband. I bought the 2xl. And will say it runs small. It fits more like a large. So my son need up with them. But they were rather cheap.
4.0,"pleasantly surprised... Like the fit, looks cute on!"
4.0,I really liked this shirt! Runs big. I ordered a small and it is still big but it is also the style. I took off a star because I don't think it is going to hold up well after being washed.
4.0,Fits nice and shipped fast...
4.0,"I bought these to wear for Achilles tendonitis pain and weak ankles.  They certainly provide good compression.  I am wearing them along with orthotic inserts (which keep my feel aligned) and in some shoes I cannot wear both together. They are not super thick but sometimes just a tad too much when wearing a sock too. I wear size 8-8.5 women's shoe and these are a good fit, but wonder if they might be too tight on a bigger foot. I feel that my feet are getting good support from these socks. I just can't wear them in certain shoes."
4.0,Hat was more thin than I thought. I believed the material would be heavier and suitable for working outside. It is not. It is good for running around town though.
4.0,Bought for my 5 yr old and they are a little too big. Sags below his nose. Might shrink after washing..
4.0,"These are more of the silky/polyester material, but they work great at keeping for cool, keeping dust and other stuff off of you. A great pattern, camo works with many situations. If you need several, this deserves a close look."
4.0,"I rarely order clothes on Amazon, but was pleased with this dress.  It fit as I expected."
4.0,"I get so many compliments. The purse feels kind of cheap.. but the wallet sooooo worth the money. It's heavy and thick and holds up. The clasp on mine gets stuck, thats my only complaint when it comes to the wallet. The purse has like three pockets on the inside but it is huge, which i like. I do love this, but $65?! Just go with the wallet alone..you will not be disappointed."
4.0,"Expected the fit to be a little looser, but it did it‚Äôs job! Was sexy and comfy! The slit definitely goes up a bit higher, so be prepared!"
4.0,I bought  the t-shirt for my granddaughter.  She loves it. She's 10 yo. She thinks the sentiment on the shirt suits her personality üôÑ üò≥
4.0,This dress is cute but kinda thin on top.  The fabric on the bottom is much heavier than the top so it kind of pulls the top down.  It is pretty so I will keep it but just understand this is china made and you can't expect much.  If you are taller than 5 feet 3 inches this might not be long enough for you.  I am 5 feet 2 and it just touches the floor if I am not wearing shoes.
4.0,"Super warm! I got a large and it fits perfectly (I wear a 34DD), still have plenty of room to wear layers. I do have a button that won't button, not sure why, but it's not like it's completely missing so the look is still there. It's fine by me, I don't plan on buttoning them all up. I do not know if this is normal or not.<br />I love that it is thin and not chunky and bulky, and it is still super warm and fuzzy! It's like being wrapped in a blanket! I washed it right away, and dryed it for a bit and it didn't shrink!"
4.0,"Every winter no matter how careful you are, eventually you end up with a bunch of mismatched scarves and hats. This set in neutral colors is really a great gifting option. Even when someone has no immediate need, having a new set still adds a smile! With homes that experience longer winters, these are a must have!"
4.0,"The watch itself is pretty. Love the dragonfly design. It took me awhile to figure out how to set it, as no directions came with the watch. I like that the size of the face has numbers which are easy to read without my glasses. The chain is rather long, and snags on certain fabrics. I plan on looking for a different chain."
4.0,Did not know that these open. Thought they would not fit the Pandora
4.0,"A little darker view than I thought, high quality."
4.0,"I like this dress a lot! The fabric is nice and the length is very appropriate. I am a little disappointed in the zipper though. When I put the dress on and tried to zip it, it did not zip up further than my waistline. I assumed it was too small and was going to return it for an XXL. Fair to say, at 210 lbs and 5'3"", I am not small, but I am also not an XXL. So it put it over my head and it fit very nice. Maybe the zip would work it someone else zipped it for me.<br />Overall, it is a good buy!"
4.0,If I bend these too far they will definitely break in half. They are SOOOO COOL though.  Never seen something like it anywhere. Luckily I‚Äôm very careful and gentle with my belongings so I believe if I keep them in the case they will last for me. If you‚Äôre not like me don‚Äôt waste your money
4.0,Loved this dress. It fit like a glove and I received many compliments on it. The only minor issue I had was it was shorter than I expected but that actually added to the sexiness of the dress. I bought a large and it fit great.
4.0,"They looks great and come well packaged but one of my lenses came with a chip other than that they look great, I wouldn‚Äôt say they are good for everyday use because of the material."
4.0,Looks good and seems warm (October 18). This vest was a discount: outside black and inside blue with less filler (feathers) than expected. Has two fairly large inside pockets that do not secure.
4.0,Its elegant and classy. The stone is big and has a finespun look to it. It's lightweight and an easy ring to wear without feeling the bulk and skin irritation<br /><br />Only downside is the thing feels cheaper than it looks. I don't feel ultra confident that it will last a very long time
4.0,My husband has chicken legs and said they were tight in the thighs but loose above that. I would have given 5 stars except for that. As long as they don't stretch out they should be fine. He wears a 36-38 waist and I went with the large size as it stated it fit a 34-27 waist. I should have gone a size down.
4.0,Nike runs about 1/2 a size smaller than other brands but I expected that so they fit my daughter great (she wears a size 1 and got her a size 1.5). They look great and she loves them. She loves the purple accents and that they look like lace up shoes but are actually velcro. So far she's enjoying wearing them to school every day. Hopefully they'll hold up
4.0,"These waders are well made and so far, no leakage. They have an attached strap/belt that can help cinch the waist - but you may need your own belt. The attached booties also can't be used on their own -- you'll need your own boots.<br /><br />There is a handy zipper pocket on the chest. They are lightweight and comfortable.<br /><br />They are a great, inexpensive option for waders."
4.0,The size C-D should be a little bigger. Other than that it's great
4.0,"The fabric, print & design are very cute and look like the picture. Unfortunately as many had said this short is best for a small bust. I have 34D and the seam gave me double boob. Not a cute fit. It does show good cleavage but squished down the breast area."
4.0,these are great for the price.  Not super comfortable but I didn't expect them to be.
4.0,These are holding up a lot better than the gloves purchased in the store at Target/Walmart.
4.0,The construction of these slipplers has not arch support.
4.0,"Very comfortable panties, great for working out or everyday use! My only issue is that my pads when on my period wouldn't stick to it snuggly. After a couple of washes it improves, but it doesn't stick well. Most likely due to the spandex. If you prefer pads this may not work for you."
4.0,Quality is great the color was a little lighter than I expected.
4.0,"I am 5.5 and the pants were a bit longer than my ankle, which did not bother me, I like pants on the longer side, in case they will shrink even a bit in the laundry or dryer I would be covered. I bought the XL based on reviews and it was way too big for me (usually size 12). I am returning them but will order the L."
4.0,"Love this hoodie. The sleeves are a little short and the leather tassles weren't as pictured - what arrived looked a little more cheap. However, I like the material of this hoodie too much to return it and will still wear it."
4.0,"my second pair.  I had to modify to Velcro strip, but otherwise works well."
4.0,"The material is nice. It‚Äôs a little tighter around the butt area, but I guess that‚Äôs my fault, lol."
4.0,"I may have ordered the wrong size. But the stripes are too big and it did not look very fashionable.on me because of my height, so I returned it."
4.0,Dont wash and get the size you want to be not the size you are
4.0,"When I first received these they were snug. Once I got them over my calf I spent 15 laying flat on my back on my bed pep talking these suckers to button. I had all but given up on them until my teenager pilfered them and wore them. How did she get them on yet I could not? I tried again and magically they fit fine. Maybe they just needed some breaking in? Now that we are on good terms with eath other, the pants fit good and look really cute. They have a snug calf/skinny jean look and fit the thigh and waist (thats almost impossible, you normally get one or the other) and were not overly long."
4.0,"Bought is for my hubby. He wore it on our wedding day, perfect size. He loves it."
4.0,"Stretchy material. Wish I had gone down a size. But lovely fit throughout the leg, great color and cute length."
4.0,"Love these! The purple is soft but pretty. You really have to be careful not to be too rough with them. Mine seemed to have a couple of scratches when i put them on for the first time, so I'm not sure if they were already scratched or scratch easily. Maybe that is why you get a case and wiping cloth with them to maintain. I get compliments on them everywhere I go."
4.0,"I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter for her panda bear Halloween costume. It is a little big on her, but overall great quality for the price. It did need some expanding/reshaping after being removed from the shipping package, which is easily achieved by stuffing a large round pillow or a blanket in there for a day or two. Would definitely recommend purchasing!"
4.0,I always order a size up on slippers cause I like the extra room. So far so good. Very warm and comfy. The inside fuzz comes off on bits during the first few wares.
4.0,"This top is soft and stretchy!<br />We were intending to get a small, but got a large so how.<br />The mannequin is a small/x-small, so the large sizing looks correct.<br />It is cute and stylish, but not quite my favorite."
4.0,"True navy, nice fit. Does seem to snag easily, but overall it‚Äôs a nice polished cardigan."
4.0,Very pleased with the quality of this inexpensive bracelet.  Bought it as a gift for our teen granddaughter and she liked it; not at all gaudy - but fun with the &#34;evil eye&#34; touch.
4.0,"True to size, comfortable & very supportive."
4.0,Love the ring great buy but it does get a little scratched up easily
4.0,I will try the extra large.  I like the dress.  I need to make sure I the clothes I buy off of Amazon is made in the USA.
4.0,Dress exactly as pictured. It‚Äôs cute but very scratchy. Not soft like little girls like.
4.0,"I liked a lot but had to return it. Runs 1 size bigger. Very comfortable, beautiful colors."
4.0,I love it!!! It‚Äôs the perfect size.
4.0,"Nice bag, somewhat smaller than I expected."
4.0,I like these very much.
4.0,It's an awesome top.  I just don't have the bust to fill it completely.  lol. Other than that I love it.
4.0,made for a great motivational gift and I really liked the necklace that came with it.
4.0,It has helped my planter faciitis..
4.0,"The bottoms are ...cheeky. far too small for my liking. But to be honest, I did mostly purchase for the wrap top - so I am satisfied!"
4.0,"When the band arrived, I noticed that the pin on the latch was weak. It broke the next day, so I had to take it to a local jeweler to have it fixed. Since he replaced the pin, the band has been great."
4.0,I liked the color choices. Compact size and case. Easy to carry even in your pocket.
4.0,CUte and soft but runs a siz large
4.0,This gives me the cafe' look at an inexpensive rate!
4.0,"very pretty, I may get me another pair in different color."
4.0,"Decent quality for the price!!  Elastic, so it fits XS-Large comfortably.  I wouldnt  reccomend this for someone who wears anything larger then a large"
4.0,These are super comfortable however the edge on the front side has rubbed my toes raw. With socks they are great though
4.0,Larger than labeled
4.0,"This is a cool looking metal cut owl keychain.  The metal , keyring, and chain are all sturdy and durable.  None of the metal components on this keychain bend easily.  Overall, nice looking and well made."
4.0,Love this dress but too tight in arms and chest.
4.0,"Does what I want, which is to tie onto my overall strap and keep my glasses handy.  Would give it<br />5 stars, but found out that the velcro wears out and won't hold after a lot of use.  Going to have to<br />sew the straps together to fit."
4.0,My granddaughter & I had the best PJ's. We looked like Christmas lights.
4.0,"These shorts are a little tight, so get 1 size larger, they fit OK"
4.0,"I really like the necklace. It would have served the purpose to add something to a top I have, but when I opened it, one of the starfish arms had broken off. I need it for this weekend so I tried it on to see if I could use it anyway. Not only did the broken arm stand out, the metal would cut. Unfortunately, this necklace will have to be returned. I may reorder and hope for better luck next time."
4.0,I like the fit of the sweater.  I do not like how large the buttons are.  Very big buttons on a short cardigan.
4.0,For the price this dress costs and the quality of received I'm surprised. I would have expected to pay at least 3 times the amount. The material is very soft and comfy to be in. Not too thick or thin.
4.0,Fabric ripped at the cuffs but other than that great for the money.
4.0,"My black one broke as soon as I put it on but it wasnt my color anyways, the brown one is nice, im wearing it right now :D"
4.0,They were a bit crooket but loved them just wish they were straight
4.0,"I love ellazhu! I cant find this style of clothes where I am from and I get compliments all the time. This did run really big on me though, but I am going to rock it."
4.0,"These are tight on my head but are otherwise great. Shipping was quick and the quality is great. I live in Colorado and these keep me warm on those cold mornings heading into work.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have a small head and they are tight, almost pressing too hard on my ears. Hopefully this eases with time and wear."
4.0,Don't know if it's just me but mine is really hard to open.. BUT I really like it
4.0,"The hat is good, But, it has an odor. you need to wash it at least twice before wearing it."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 112-115lbs (in between sizes)  I ordered the Navy at Christmas time and it came super wrinkled but I use Downey fabric wrinkle remover and about 10 minutes after spraying and smoothing out the wrinkles it was great ( an iron may ruin the light fabric)! I got a lot of compliments on it you can wear it with heels, flats or tennis shoes!<br /><br />This light denim color popped up on sale for $9.99 and the denim light blue is adorable for the price!  The Navy was 29.99 plus tax a little bit expensive, so when I  saw this color on sale I immediately bought it, it‚Äôs so much cuter than the photos and comfortable especially when in between sizes. While they‚Äôre baggy they‚Äôre not overly big! I got the Xsmall it‚Äôs perfect‚Äô but as others stated the buttons do come off but it‚Äôs a 2 minute fix!<br /><br />Love the material and  style bought 3 colors Navy, light denim, and a brown!. Because they‚Äôre so light weight, cropped bottom  you can wear with a tank top or cami for summer and long sleeves in fall and winter very versatile imho! If your in the fence buy it they‚Äôre great! I‚Äôm 62 and it‚Äôs very flattering my 27 year old daughter tried it on and loved it as well!"
4.0,"I purchased this for my boyfriend to try and help him with some of the muscle aches he gets from working all day on his feet.<br />He is a size medium usually with a 32 inch waist. These compression pants for men were the perfect resolution.<br /> The only negative thing I can think of about them is the fit;  I ordered a size medium and they are a little bit too loose. We should have ordered a small because they are very stretchy.<br />The waistband is very comfortable and does not cause any irritation. The scenes are put together nicely and the material is super slick and soft.<br />The pants look exactly like the picture so you get what you see. They did alleviate some of his aches but he said it would have been better if they were tighter.<br /> Overall, they are high quality compression pants and are a great addition to the working man's wardrobe. I imagine they would be good for work out too."
4.0,"the ring is a very pretty ring which is one of the reasons I got it, however the first ring I got broke instantly within a day. It was all ok the seller sent me another right and this one I have had for a good amount of time. I would recommend them to a friend. Over all a very good ring for the price!"
4.0,very cute. nice quality and details.
4.0,"Love the color and size.  Slightly heavier than I hoped for, but very pretty."
4.0,"Stylish and lightweight sunglasses, It also comes with a black compact sized sunglass case."
4.0,"Very cute in person; I had to add extension to it because I'm plus sized, but that's perfectly fine. Great set for the price!!!"
4.0,"Beautiful, vibrantly colored necklace. The length is perfect. I am 5'5&#34; and it sits below my chest so that it doesn't bounce when I walk. It's so bright that I am not sure what to wear it with yet, but it is definitely high quality."
4.0,"Great for wearing under a blazer. Good color, fabric feels great - I am a very happy camper."
4.0,Gorgeous color . Good quality.<br />Sadly too small . Should have gone up 2 sizes
4.0,It is a large piece of jewelry and the chain is long.
4.0,These are beautiful tights..very well made. I am just disappointed in the color. I ordered ‚Äúlight yellow‚Äù which turned out to be very much a mustard yellow and not at all what the picture looks like. Too bad.
4.0,That shirt is awesome!!! I have a large bust so I ordered 3x but the rest of the shirt is huge as well. I'm keeping it cause I dont mind but order 1-2 sizes smaller than your usual and you'll be good.
4.0,"The buttons seem loose but they‚Äôre actually fine, they‚Äôre just so loud. I sound like Santa‚Äôs reindeer. But the shirt itself is as described<br /><br />Edit: after 3 months and about 15 wears there‚Äôs a huge hole in the armpit extending down the side"
4.0,"Order it and do like it. Its a really flimsy knit matriel, but it is very big. I'm not a very big person so it kinda felt like a bag"
4.0,"This is a nice, simple dress. I was looking for something to wear with printed leggings, and this fit the bill"
4.0,"The tent has held up great after a few weeks use, albeit in good weather conditions. The stakes are lower quality, I bent two of them after a week (I think there are 8-10 or so).<br /><br />It is spacious for one, but was still big enough for two (fits two 25 inch sleeping pads). With that said, it isn't long in length. I'm 6'1, if you're over 6'2 don't buy this tent.<br />I've seen small amounts of condensation near the foot of the tent (which was staked out, but I didn't use the guy lines). Wasn't a big issue at all.<br /><br />Light enough for 1-2 person weekend backpacking or for car camping. I'd even consider it for a week long 2 person backpacking trip.<br /><br />The burrito bag makes putting it away easy. Easy assembly and spacious enough for two people to sit up and play cards or what have you. Vestibules add enough space if you are backpacking with two people. Easy to get in and out.<br /><br />I also like the colors more in person than in the pictures too. The peel back rain fly that you can then roll down just by reaching out of the tent is super clutch for stargazing or warm dry nights.<br /><br />I think I'm going to be a Sierra Designs fan for a long time.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are going to car camp or only do short backpacking trips, are 6'1 or shorter and want a tent that is on the high quality end of bargain/midrange tents (if you buy it on sale), then this is the tent for you."
4.0,"I am glad I read previous buyers' reviews before I ordered this because several of them said it runs Small. So I ordered the next size up (I usually wear a Small but instead got a Medium).  It was snug, but once wet it did loosen a little. Small would not have fit me. I really like that it's a full zip-up so it's easy to put on when I am in the pool and getting chilly since I use it to help me stay warmer, especially when it gets very breezy."
4.0,I love my earrings. I can't wait to wear them to Easter service :)
4.0,From other reviews I ordered up one size. I noted in reviews smaller on top larger on bottom. If this is you‚Äôre figure you‚Äôre in luck - it‚Äôs cute. I‚Äôll probably keep because it is cute for Spring casual and figure out how to take in least an extra inch or two in the hips.  But the material does stick out if you can‚Äôt fill the hip area up and looks strange.
4.0,"I'm a big girl and the elastic waist of this skirt was too small for me to wear comfortably. I have returned it. For smaller women, this skirt is a fun, twirly kind of indulgence."
4.0,very nice fits perfect on a child.
4.0,"This is a nice hat for the price.  It wasn't crushed when it arrived, and it even has a hatband.  It did come with a couple of minor imperfections in the weave on top (barely noticeable) and there were hot glue hairs all over it, but other than that, it's fine. I'm going to wear it to a Kentucky Derby party and will probably never wear it again, so it serves the purpose."
4.0,I bought it for my sisters birthday and she loves it
4.0,"A bit more lose than expected, and I was worried that it would be TOO tight. Go a size smaller. Besides that, they are pretty comfy. I'd love it a bit more tighter on the arch. It calls out Arch Support, but I can't tell a difference in tension between that grey strip versus the other parts."
4.0,Much better than I expected.  I had read a bunch of reviews of similar masks & wasn't expecting much.. but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a thick vinyl material that looks like leather.<br /><br />It does come packaged flat which puts a crease in it.  I've stuffed mine with newspaper in the hope that it will shape up correctly.<br /><br />Overall... it's not bad. With one complaint.. the center strap is a little short which makes the mask ride up on your head.<br /><br />The people at the grocery store weren't as amused as I was.
4.0,"Cute color, material isn‚Äôt as soft as expected. Also thin material but not see thru. Overall recommend not bad for cost"
4.0,"They work good and seem reasonable well made.  However,  it's a bit of stretch to say it is credit card size and fits in a wallet.  It might fit in a very large wallet."
4.0,I liked the jacket but the sizing is very small.  I usually wear a size 10 in tops but I couldn't even get this jacket zipped in the Medium size.  I returned it and am deciding whether or not to re-order the same jacket in Large.  I am hesitant due to the reviews that mention the really long sleeves.  The sleeves on the Medium were too long for me but would have been OK if the rest of the jacket fit properly.  I didn't agree with other reviews that said the jacket was boxy.  It had a slightly tapered waist and other features that made it seem feminine.
4.0,"Good for the price and very pretty but it broke the first time I wear it , any way I could fix it"
4.0,Nice product for the price . Nothing bad to say about this product only had a few days now.
4.0,"Absolutely love the dress!!!!  If I had to change one thing it would be to have the materiel of the skirt have alittle bit more give rather than giving the feel of be in a bustle from the 1700. But on the plus side ,it gives the illusion of a buttüçë :: XOXO April (the Girlfriend of the account holder, purchaser/wearer of said dress)"
4.0,"Love the PJs for my little one, but they are a tad bit short in both the pants and shirt. They seemed fine when she tried them on upon arrival, but after a wash (cold water) and hang dry, they are about 1-2&#34; too short. Wished I ordered her a size up."
4.0,fits well as the tunic material is soft and it does fit the bust area fine
4.0,Well I guess I know how bad this pandemic has affected my weight when I can‚Äôt even fit into an Asian manufacturer‚Äôs size 2XL. I‚Äôm about a 10-12 in US clothes. These looked and felt pretty good but were just a bit too snug up top. Will likely return.
4.0,"I broke the chain to my favorite necklace so I ordered this one as a replacement. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I thought it would be a thicker chain. However,it is a beautiful chain in its own right. It does work as a replacement chain too which is what I wanted it for. It is delicate so I worry about it breaking but it hasn't yet. Overall, it is a great chain!"
4.0,"Nice dress just needed a smaller size. I normally wear a medium or large and even checked the measurements provided. Yet if I order again, I would actually choose XS. Thanks"
4.0,"nice looking shirt, fits well but seems to be cut for a slim person. Personally am average build and seems a bit snug overall."
4.0,These glasses are super cute and exactly what I imagined as more and they arrived way earlier than expected üòç the only down side was the nose peices came loose luckily I had a small enough screw driver to tighten them.
4.0,"Sharp looking wedges, fits great! Comfortable to walk."
4.0,I bought 2 of these.  The fabric is not cotton like one might think. I it a slick fabric not what you would expect to hang on to eggs?  The family that I gave it to has two daughters who collect eggs daily and they claim that it works very well and that they love it!!
4.0,"Pretty hat and easily sized to fit head.  My only disappointment is that the accent tie came off immediately, but of course can be replaced just as easily."
4.0,"The dress is cute,I missed the &#34;mini&#34; part..good thing I am short..because at least it comes to my knees I have to get the nerve to wear it."
4.0,They run about a size smaller . Toe area is narrow
4.0,So beautiful and it is very solid and not cheap and flimsy feeling but it was so big that it was literally resting on my top lip
4.0,I have thick hips. I love how this fits. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 weigh 200.
4.0,This is going to be used as a bridesmaid dress for a wedding in October. I went by their size chart and ordered an 18. I'm normally a 14-16 in jeans so definitely go by the size chart not your normal size. The dress is a little big &amp; baggy in areas but I'm sure a 16 would've been too small. There is no give to the fabric. It'll need to be altered and taken in. Easy fixes. Also worth noting the color plum is more of a purple grape color than the dark version shown here.
4.0,This shirt is very nice its just a little loose on me but I don't recommend getting a size smaller.
4.0,"I wear the XS/S in lululemon and ordered the small. It was an inch or two wider and longer (so I would want an XS). The material was similar, but the inside fleece material was thinner and lighter in weight. Overall, a good dupe. Please make a funnel neck dupe."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a nice dress in general- good quality and really soft also nice design and looks great on me but it is too thin you can see everything through, probably good as a ocean outfit"
4.0,I like this dress.  I'm not sure yet but think I will send it back and order the next smaller size as it feels/looks a bit big on me.
4.0,"I took a gamble on this one since there are no reviews so because of that I wanted to make this pretty detailed for the next buyer. I purchased both the white and the sage green color.<br /><br />Material:<br />Material is great. It's your standard ribbed cotton which is usually what I look for in tanks like this so it's not see through unlike most polyester or rayon fabrics I didn't wear a bra with it and I felt totally comfortable that nothing was showing through. It has a decent amount if stretch to it. Just be aware that most cotton materials like this may stretch out alittle bit over time.<br /><br />Sizing:<br />I'm a size 8 (36B) and purchased both a medium and a large b/c I'm usually always right in between sizes. The medium fit so perfectly that I almost didn't even bother trying on the large but I did just for the heck of it and was so surprised that they fit almost exactly the same. I prefer the medium only because it hugs my body slightly more but the large was not loose or ill fitting in anyway. If youre not between sizes, I would say definitely stick to your normal size. If you are between sizes but have a smaller chest I'd go with the smaller of the two. but if you have a larger chest the larger size may fit you a little better.<br /><br />Fit:<br />I chose this top because on the model it looked like the sides were quite low and that's what I look for/prefer when it comes to tank tops. I hate when the sides are all up in my arm pits (so uncomfortable for me!). So I was a little disappointed that the sides are not as low as they appear on the model (for either size). I feel like I'm constantly trying to pull it down. They're not super high up though to where the average person would be uncomfortable. I understand that this may only apply to me as I'm very picky when it comes to this aspect but if this isn't something that bothers you then I think you'll really like the fit! There's also no tag in the back so trying to figure out what was the front took me a minute lol I had to try it on both ways. But doing this I realized that you really could wear it either way. The correct way is how it shows on the model but the other way is a higher racer style neck that's also super flattering. It looks great either way so I don't think any one would ever know you had it on backwards. Especially because there's no tag.<br /><br />Overall I think most ppl would be very pleased with this top. I would absolutely recommend!"
4.0,"I haven't had a bum deal on Amazon before; This isn't exactly a bunch deal, but two things:<br /><br />‚ñ™Ô∏é First, I ordered navy blue, and received a color that's a cross between olive drab and light green; It's not a bad color mind you, but it was to be used for our paranormal teams investigations, and dark is usually best used during photography of anomalies, etc. at night. But, I'm going to use it anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br /><br />‚ñ™Ô∏é Lastly, this was advertised as a male fleece. It's been my understanding that the pull tab on the front zipper was always on the right side for men. ü§î Well, it's on the left... üôÑ Since I'm keeping it, and it's really a fine quality garmet- I'll just tell my team that it's specially for left handed men on paranormal teams... üòè They won't believe me, of course, but it will get a chuckle!<br /><br />--Doc Lykins, EMT-Paramedic (Ret.),  Virginia Paranormal Exploration Society (VaPES)"
4.0,The pouch could be a bit bigger but it still looks good under my jeans.
4.0,I mean for what l  payed for it look good . I like the Jade heart  a wear it every day to work but with a different chain and  it has healed up nicely!
4.0,"I had severe blistering on both feet that took more than 3 weeks to clear up. The pain was extremely severe and I couldn‚Äôt walk without the socks. As it was, walking was still very painful as was getting my feet wet."
4.0,"They not as heavy as I worried they'd be, but the connectors sometimes cause them to stick in awkward positions beneath my ears, haha. Otherwise I got a lot of compliments on them! The green in them threw me off some though, guess I didn't notice it before I bought them."
4.0,"Very comfortable frame. The lens is pretty light, probably good for most. My daughter and I have more light sensitive eyes so perhaps we should have opted for a gray lens instead. Overall nice Sunnies...just for us they'll be for partly cloudy bright days"
4.0,"I did not give it 5 stars because the elastic it comes with needs to be more substantial and tighter (even though it's adjustable), I swung it at a wine bottle at although it made a small mark didn't break it. I was doing it in the bid padded envelope Amazon ships stuff in so I did give it a pretty hard whack knowing there wouldn't be a mess- not full force but as much momentum as could be expected to generate if you were trapped inside a car."
4.0,"This sweater is so soft, and not itchy at all, and a great color.  I am 5'4"", 125 lbs and the small/medium was like a dress on me, it hit about 3 inches above the knee.  Returning, wish there was an XS or petite size."
4.0,Great product! Just what I ordered
4.0,"Love this keychain. Sturdy but not too heavy or bulky. Only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because when I opened the package, the GMC emblem was off. In the package but it wasn‚Äôt very sticky and just came off I guess? I put a dot of super glue on it and popped it back into place. That held. But overall, a cool and unique keychain."
4.0,Nice items..
4.0,good fit and works well for my 6 year old
4.0,"Overall a nice dress, looks as it does in the picture. You definitely get what you pay for. It fits as expected."
4.0,Love it!  Gauge ended up being too big though.
4.0,"Capezio seems to run a tad bit small/tight? I always ordered this brand for my girls because they're known for their quality - but beware, if your girl is not a bean'pole -size up they run tight/small. Like a size 4/5 is better to fit a 4 year old verses a 5 year old. Fast shipping though is always a plus."
4.0,Awesome style and fit!
4.0,I was surprised at the weight of the necklace. Doesn't feel cheap for the price. The metal in the necklace is a different color in person. More of a brassy gold tone. Still a very cute necklace.
4.0,"they run small in length and width, but are super squishy fantastic."
4.0,"Good sturdy warm socks. Not my favorites when it's 90+ outside, but awesome otherwise."
4.0,I bought this sandal for my son. This sandal runs about a size too large. I really like the fact that it is such good quality for the price I'm keeping it. He will grow into it. So I don't know yet how it wears to be continued.
4.0,"Runs Small,  Or maybe I‚Äôm Just Fat Lol"
4.0,"A little on the cheap side , would not pay more than I did, but it is nice for the summer"
4.0,My daughter loves them. Says they are cushy. She likes the fact that there is a toe ring type holder than it going between her toe.
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace that belies its affordable price.  The stone was clear, colorful and very realistic.  The workmanship looked great to the naked eye, and the clasp was adjustable and easy enough to use.  She really like it and has worn it many times.  I took off one star becuase it does not have the same look of quality when viewed from the back, but it is heavy enough that it normally stays straight.  Especially impressive for the price."
4.0,Ordered for my daughter the split BFF necklaces. Very nice quality. Shipping took a couple of weeks.
4.0,The wrong color frames were sent to me.  They were supposed to be the bone colored / tan ones.  Kind of dissapointing. They still serve the same purpose but they don't look as cool üôÑüôÑ
4.0,"Really cute, but as I‚Äôve adjusted it a couple of times it‚Äôs started to compromise the metal. It‚Äôs fine for right now, but I think over time it will break."
4.0,"These fit great, and are super comfy. I would never wear them if I were running though,  it a lot of support."
4.0,"I love the color, but it's a little too big."
4.0,"I love the way you can see every card, but I wish the other side had a bit more room and was more flexable"
4.0,needed smaller hoops for every day wear. I like them
4.0,"My son loves his pajamas and they‚Äôve held up pretty well but they do show some wear after a while and are a bit thin, but they are meant to for warm weather so we are pretty happy with them."
4.0,The hat is what I was looking for and is attractive and seems well made. I have a small head so was not surprised that it was too large but was able to remedy that easily by adding padding to the inside band.
4.0,Fit nicely- Not tight. Easy and comfortable to wear and looks good.
4.0,It's a bit on the tighter side when trying to put it over your head but is comfortable.  I do love it.
4.0,to big needed a large size not extra large
4.0,Cute top. Material a little thin but overall comfortable.
4.0,Got this in a large based on the reviews which fit perfectly. The shoulders and arm length were perfect. I'm usually a S/M weigh 130lb and 5'4. It's not too thin but you'll need to wear a tank underneath.
4.0,"Great for all day use, don't pull to hard they tear. But still work"
4.0,"Nice ring, I had bought in the wrong size the first time. So I put it on a necklace and bought a new one. Fits good and doesn't scratch up to easy."
4.0,"cute dress, tight in the breast area but it‚Äôs real nice"
4.0,sizing is a bit off but nice order a little bigger
4.0,Not the warmest Fleece lined leggings but very soft and looks great
4.0,"They look great and, if you do it carefully, bend really well. They are light weight but the real test will come while wearing them all day. Wish they came with clear straps instead of white ribbon but that‚Äôs my only issue right now."
4.0,"These are larger pendants than I generally use.  Very pretty and seems to be as well made as other products.  My only issue is that when I have added the image behind the cabochon, once the adhesive dries you can tell is is not evenly spread across the flat surface of the cab even though I was careful to add what I thought was adequate Judkins Diamond Glaze on one and DecoArt on the other.  May be part of my learning curve."
4.0,Comfortable and cute pattern
4.0,Est√°n muy bonitos me gustaron mucho
4.0,The reason I gave four stars is because the three tool that came with or very different in size. I knew they would be different sizes but two of them for so long I can‚Äôt imagine they would be the correct size for hardly anyone. The pendent it self was perfect and exactly as described!
4.0,People who complained about the stockings being too tight don't understand the purpose of the stockings. They are perfect tightness. They look so cute I would buy another pair. The only thing I would change is the foot pad is shaped awkward and needs frequent adjusting. Not sure why people say they are too long. I am 5'3 and they fit perfectly just below my knee.
4.0,Only complaint is the price.
4.0,"Gorgeous color. I got a size up, it fits comfortably."
4.0,"Cute shirt! I always purchase plain shirts to wear, so I like the details of this one with the buttons up top to give it a little flair! The shirt also has pockets which works nicely for keys or a cell phone!"
4.0,Nice quality and good size. Just what I was looking for.
4.0,for an xxl shirt it fits kind of snug.<br />i wouldnt not put this shirt in the dryer<br />id wash it and then hang it up to dry.
4.0,"We are hard on sunglasses so we buy 'em cheap. These are usually around $8 and are stylish enough... and the lenses aren't too dark like some other Locs. My husband loves these and we've probably ordered this model at least four times. You get what you pay for though... on every single pair he's owned, the frame has broken along the top rim of the lenses. So don't expect them to last too long, but at least it won't break the bank to replace them."
4.0,I like the stretch of this bracelet but it broke apart.
4.0,"A very good value and it is comfortable to wear.  The size is about right for someone that wants a small less noticeable watch.  The light feature is too dim to use, but I use it out on my sailboat and out in my woodworking shop so it doesn't matter."
4.0,I really like this nightgown. I bought a large and I normally wear large so it's true to size. I actually really like the length. It goes below my knees. Material feels really silky so its smooth on my skin. My only complaint is that it is mildly see thru. I think if I didnt wear a sports bra you would be able to see thru it and I wouldn't be comfortable wearing it around the house.
4.0,Great shirt! Less baggy in the arms than the other Magcomsen shirt with the collar. As a woman I appreciate it!
4.0,"Good. The only thing is that if it is caught in the hair and you pull too hard, the chain can detach. You just need some tweezers to re-attach it again."
4.0,Stays in place pretty well
4.0,"Good fit, cloth is very thin but very nice and pretty dress for the price!"
4.0,it will be nicer if the edges are more rounded and some sort of mark is added to the spin ring so you can actually see it rotates around.
4.0,Gave it to my neighbors daughter for when she plays on her tablet. she loves them.. says she looks like me :)<br />Great way to help with children who play on tablets often.
4.0,Neckline slightly off but so casual and comfortable it can be overlooked
4.0,Too big for a 1 year old naby
4.0,Love this dress. Very ladylike.
4.0,"Very cute, fits as expected! It's comfortable, with soft flowy material."
4.0,The slipper runs more narrow than most (which is why I purchased them). The footbed is firm; no cushioning-I will have to add a gel pad.
4.0,My wrist is about 7 and 3/4 in. This is a tight fit. I like my bracelets loose. I prefer an 8&#34; watch or bracelet. I bought an extender from Amazon to add. It added enough length to make it comfortable for me.
4.0,"Wish they were not so dated. The material could have been cuter, but I now have a sample and can make my own. Great buy overall."
4.0,This is a luxurious robe and great quality.  Well worth the price! May not fit larger sized men with bigger waist sizes.
4.0,Just what I wanted..a red hooded light weight jacket. I like it and size was true.
4.0,Great buy for the price. Keeps good time. A close resemblance to my Rolex Sub which is nice when I want to wear gold.
4.0,It's only the stone. I still like it though.
4.0,A great buy off of Amazon.  This Garment bag is durable and I love all the individual zip components for additional items.
4.0,"After putting this on my house key, I wasn't able to unlock the door to my home. So, I had to use an exacto knife to cut away the excess and it works great now, but I hate that it doesn't look the way it's supposed to.<br /><br />I wish they made it better fitted for the average house key."
4.0,"The pocket is large, it holds my iPhone 6+ easily. The leggings are somewhat shiny, so if you don't like that look, I wouldn't recommend them. Overall, they are a quality pair of pants."
4.0,"It's a good small wallet. It has about four pockets for cards,  three in the front and a fourth behind the three. The card holders are tighter than normal,  but just after a few days of use they have loosenes up,  so just another thing to break in the wallet.  My husband loves it and we are happy with it."
4.0,Not as pretty as the picture made them look. A little bigger then expected. Looked very nice on my wife's ears.
4.0,"I‚Äôm not a small guy, but this fit a little more snug than my other Spyder gear. Definitely keeping and wearing."
4.0,It's a little awkward with all of the strings hanging off but overall it works.
4.0,Looks beautiful. Item is inexpensive thus do not expect it of being of good quality. will probably need to be thrown out after or even within the current season. do not expect the top to give you support.
4.0,"what you pay, is what you get"
4.0,"this is very pretty. especially if you are already in shape. as far as really working out in it, i think i may need a larger size.<br />the top constantly moved around and i was for positive i was going to pop out at any moment. I did not feel comfortable doing my workout. BUT if i was already in shape i think it would have been okay."
4.0,Love the color. Wish it was a bit bigger
4.0,"The swimming suit is cute, but it didn't fit me correctly.  The straps seemed like they were sewn too closely to the neck.  Returned it for a different suit."
4.0,"I loved it, comfy and light weight."
4.0,"I used to clean my silver with cream and water , it was just a hassle because the sponge did not clean the small details that jewelry has.. This cloth is perfect because I feel that I can clean my jewelry as I am getting ready to go to work."
4.0,Love it! Easy to use and clean.
4.0,"This is my first time for buying these &#34;¬ÆBeFit24 Elegant Knee High Graduated Mild Compression Support Socks for Women (10-14 mmHg, 40 Denier &#34;1&#34; Pair)&#34; The description is what attracted me to these particular ones. I thought these socks were only for use when your legs started to get swollen but how wrong. After speaking to a doctor, she had mentioned that these could be worn for almost anything, and anytime. (not to sleep in though)<br /> Had these a couple of weeks now and they definitely make a difference. Having a job where I'm on my feet all day I used to go home with very tired legs, but these compression stockings have definitely leave my legs feeling fresher less tired after a day at work. They arrived very quickly and such good value. I have tried a cheaper pair from a shop and by the time I got them on I thought my legs were about to burst!! These are comfortable yet you can still feel the compression working.<br /><br />~The benefits these socks provide include~<br /><br />Benefit 1 ‚Äì When you first put them on, they are tight, but you will find that you no longer get any strange feelings in your legs such as pins and needles, etc. in your calves or thighs. They will help you with swollen legs, and they prevent/stop your feet from swelling.<br /><br />Benefit 2 ‚Äì The socks are made from a thin material, so they can be worn with pumps and court shoes. They are comfortable to wear, so you can wear them often. They are suitable for long walks. They help combat aching and tired legs, and they help keep your legs fresh.<br /><br />Benefit 3 ‚Äì If you have had an operation, they can be worn after surgery. They can also be worn if you have had any injuries to your legs, including shin splints, etc. And if you are a cyclist, you can wear them as well.<br /><br />Benefit 4 ‚Äì Pregnant women can benefit from compression socks, and nurses can wear them throughout their day and night shifts. They are safe to wear and are comfy and airy. The material isn‚Äôt too thick and can help with regulating your body temperature.<br /><br /> All in all, it does what it says on the packet!<br /><br />This is my review for the &#34; BeFit24 product order on Amazon ( ¬ÆBeFit24 Elegant Knee High Graduated Mild Compression Support Socks for Women (10-14 mmHg, 40 Denier)&#34;<br />I try to review items I need or have a strong interest in so in order I can provide a review based on a real genuine trial. My opinions and experiences with the product are an actual true reflection of my personal experiences with the item. These reviews that I write are not in any way influenced by the seller or website that the product.<br />Because many of the products that I review, I have not been discounted or given this product for free. I chose to review so others can see what a great product this is. I do though still try to supply as much information as I can in terms of my initial experiences with the product, and the contents of the product as well."
4.0,Pretty yet heavy (weight wise)
4.0,Looks like the picture! Wish it fit -_- I ordered a medium for a snug fit but it's too small. I feel large might be too tight still but I can be worn as tube top with a boho skirt n looks great!
4.0,very pleased with this item. size and discription is accurate. can't wait to wear.
4.0,The hijab is great except they smelled funny upon arriving.
4.0,Got it for Christmas and she loves it
4.0,Almost perfect!  The reason why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is bc the material is thin. Will need to have a slip underneath. But looks absolutely wonderful and fits to a tee!
4.0,Fun and unique sunglasses.
4.0,"These aren't the warmest gloves out there, but they definitely help on cold days, and they work very well with my smartphone."
4.0,Colorful & pretty.
4.0,Arrived fast..runs larger than expected..crown and lil bra doesnt come with fasteners gotta tie it. Hoping it works out with photo shoot. Will buy from seller again
4.0,Good for the price but it came in a little lopsided. It's not too noticable but still a slight bummer.
4.0,the belt is a great stretch belt.
4.0,Comfortable but to tight at the top.Still leaves deep impression in my leg.
4.0,It would be nice if the opening at the ankle was a bit bigger but overall very easy to get on and these are cozy warm
4.0,"Overall I definitely like the slippers, they're comfortable fur on the inside is soft and nice and the memory foam souls feel good. We will see how well they last and I will say that they tend to run small but they will also probably break in and be just fine."
4.0,Heavy keyring nicely made
4.0,"My son picked these out for my husband for Christmas & he loves them!! I was hesitant to buy them because of the cheap price Oh, I thought they would be cheaply made. But that is not the case!"
4.0,"This is a great wig for cosplaying Jade Harley, Vriska, and Aradia! I'll send a few pictures of what it looked like wearing it. It tangles easy, so a wig brush is recommended, and when tangled the hair fell out a bit easily. It was also a bit thing at the top, and if you moved the bangs far enough it will show the netting imside the wig. But great color, waves and cirls, price was great too!"
4.0,nice teeshirt
4.0,For 10 dollars I'd say it's great. I just received the white one and it looks good. I hope the stones stay on but if not the box claims it's an easy fix with glue
4.0,"This suit came in 1 day and is just as nice as the picture. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it doesn't have a button hole on the pants, but it does have a button. I was nervous ordering a size 6 for my son who is turning 8 soon, but I followed the sizing chart and it was right. It fits perfectly."
4.0,"Very fashionable shirt,  the material is fresh"
4.0,Very cute but the strap came apart. The metal hooks holding the trap loosen. I have to tighten it in order for it to stay. For now I rotate the hooks so the strap can stay in place. It would‚Äôve gotten 5stars. It has just enough space
4.0,"I really like the glasses, but a screw fell out only a little while after purchase. I would love to get a replacement screw because I love these glasses."
4.0,I love drop waste dresses but this one looks nothing like it does on model (of course) If you get the size stated it won‚Äôt be as loose. I still like the fit that it has on me.
4.0,Works for the price and cute little gifts for friends.
4.0,"I bought it for my African safari trip, it was easy to carry and worked well for me, even though the hat style isn‚Äôt quite a safari style, I am not a perfect style matching person so I didn‚Äôt care that much."
4.0,What I liked:<br />- N95 quality<br />- It folks nice and flat when not wearing it<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />- It doesn't have a loop on each side that goes over your ears<br />  -- You must put 2 separate loops over your head (around bottom of neck and top of head)<br />  -- You put the bottom loop around your head/neck and then put the top loop around top of head<br />- It totally messes up my hair to where I need to comb it after I install it<br />- I also wonder how long the loops will last since you have to stretch them firmly to go around your head<br /><br />ADVICE TO MANUFACTURER: Install loops that go around your ears (not your entire head)
4.0,"The lining of this coat is a little on the cheap side, but frankly, I only wear this as an outer coat anyway, so it's never in direct contact with my skin. Aside from that, I love it- it's warm and fits nicely and makes me feel like I'm right out of assassin's creed when I walk around in it with the hood up. LOVE IT."
4.0,"Super cute, fit even better than I expected, love the nose thing that fits the mask to my nose. Only thing is with the filter it feels like I'm suffocating. Like no air is coming through at all. I hear that means it's effective though. I use it without the filter. It might not be as effective but without the filter atleast there is still 4 layers of cloth covering."
4.0,Very comfortable product they do run small size wise though
4.0,"I bought this same sweater in a large from another seller and thought it was a little big so I got this one in a medium and it‚Äôs just as large, I would say the sleeves are even longer in length then the large. The waist ties are long, so I cut them because they keep getting in the way."
4.0,Nice for the price. Wish there was a sewn seam at the top and bottom. Yes that would negate the seamless but it would keep them from fraying.
4.0,Very stylish just not for me
4.0,The mask was beautiful!!! I got so many compliments at the masquerade party I attended. I gave it four stars because one of the stones was broke off when it arrived. I had to super glue it on. It‚Äôs also pretty heavy so if that would be an issue I wouldn‚Äôt get it.
4.0,I like the original band that tucks in the end of band.
4.0,"These socks are really cute, my daughter likes them very much. The quality is good and the colours are nice.."
4.0,Its Christmas gift. Nut looks pretty good
4.0,I read the reviews and notice most people felt the shirt run small.  I ordered my size (Large- 38 DDD bra) and it was actually big and provided no support.  The purpose of this tank is to provide support not for luxury or extra room.<br /><br />I now need to either buy another size or another brand for support.
4.0,"This is a great item, very good quality. Would definitely recommend. The only thing is it runs very large. I ordered exactly as directed by the size chart, an XL. I ended up needing a medium"
4.0,"The shirt fits a little small.  The cut of the neckline is lower than I thought. But so a nice shirt. I have a 42DD chest and normally 2xl woman's is fine,  but not this time."
4.0,"Material at top is a little thin but fits great otherwise! Love the pockets! I ordered small and am 5‚Äô3, 140 and 36D"
4.0,"These look like they would work.  The sad thing is, I bought almost a dozen pair of similar gloves a couple of years ago for the same purpose.  But those gloves had ruffles, a decorative ribbon, little ornate buttons....  I should have bought a lifetime supply because now I've worn them all out.  Why couldn't these be pretty?"
4.0,"My son is a huge Murder She wrote fan, so when I saw this shirt I knew he had to have it! It's TRUE to size, came on time, and he loves it! Everyone keeps asking him where he got it! Made my Christmas! Thank you"
4.0,Cute for teenagers! Thumbs up for the price. The only thing is that when you put it on the watch itself is being covered by the braded one. It's the way they put it together.
4.0,Thought they would an small.
4.0,These are cute! Have 4 stars because they‚Äôre gigantic.
4.0,Is a little bug but the girls can grow into it but nice soft cool material.
4.0,"Bought these for my really skinny daughter. They are too tight on her, she loves them but I feel they run a tad small"
4.0,that's the least confusing way
4.0,Great product for them money
4.0,Nice boots for Undyne cosplay
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful, however, in real life that are much smaller than you‚Äôd expect. I thing they would work well for someone with multiple piercings on their ears."
4.0,"I'm a woman that wears an average hat size. I'm always interested in reviewing gaiters. The first ones out were quite small - clearly designed for an Asian market. The sizing has gotten better, and this is one that I can get behind.<br /><br />First, let me say that I thought it was a bit tighter around the neck than I personally like, but I think that has more to do with the fabric not being as stretchy as others. The sewn seams seem a bit scratchier than others I've tried, too. However, once it's on, the gaiter is quite comfortable. It sits loosely around my ears, but not so loose that it slips down. It will, I think, work well on a man's face because of the extra room, so that definitely is something to consider. I get around any fogging of my glasses by just pulling the mask over my nose and sitting my glasses on top. I also prefer the bandana style bottom, because when the gaiter is pulled down, there's less fabric bunched up.<br /><br />Please be aware that, while these may fulfill your area's requirements for wearing masks, air passes through them quite easily and I don't feel confident they'll do anything to stop a virus. They will, however, stop dust, pollen and bugs. I took off one star because of the lack of stretch in the fabric, and because of the kinda scratchy seams, but I will still be happy to recommend this because of the way it fits. It really is unisex and I believe most men would be able to wear it comfortably."
4.0,It's really cute but on the thin side you bought it for my granddaughter you definitely have to where something underneath .
4.0,"For the do-it-yourselfer who attaches these to bands, they are more than adequate as long as you don't expect them to be performing well for years."
4.0,I like these pants but the seams feel odd on my legs while working out. I will not be purchasing the same design again.
4.0,"These are very cute and not at all expensive. However, they fall out super easy! Maybe it‚Äôs just my piercing, I usually have the screw type of piercing for my nose and those tend to stay in better. However these are very cute!"
4.0,"It's a nice shirt, nothing over the top. It has no collar stay slots, and the buttons are a little far apart, but it is very comfortable for a full day of work.  At the price I payed, it was a good deal."
4.0,This is a cute dress causal dress the only think I would change is the neck line I wish it was a v neck to create a slimmer affect. But at 5'7 220lbs 44 bust 35 waist and 47 hips this dress fits and though it is a lightweight material its not sheer on my body( my bra does not show).. I am pleased.
4.0,"Much larger than the size ordered. Guess he will grow into them, otherwise made well."
4.0,"They will shrink.  They are not super big, but kinda big.  I can still wear them no problem, and they may shrink the way my husband does the laundry."
4.0,I love the colors and the style. The lens were just a little big for my liking.
4.0,happy with this dress
4.0,I wish it was a little bigger. I do love the bag!!
4.0,The company is very responsive to emails! The sweatshirt fits exactly the way I had wanted it too!
4.0,Nice quality.. A little thinner then I like .. But for the price I'm not complaining ..
4.0,"Have to adjust them occasionally, not sure if I got the right size but works well for what I needed them for."
4.0,"This hat is made really nice and fits well. The large US Air Force lettering is not really clear so I did what another reviewer did, I used a black fine point permanent maker to go over the outside edges and made it look a whole lot better. Would have given't a higher rating if the words US Air Force stood out better."
4.0,"After my wife worn it for a bit, it fit fine on me.  I changed my mind.  It is a good product."
4.0,Fits great ! Washes well
4.0,"Fits great and is very soft, but the color is not accurate. The model photo looks heathered and the color I received is a solid grey/blue. Still cute, but not what I expected."
4.0,Love these glasses. I have bought 3 pairs already. But only one concern is that the pin holding them together comes apart away to easy. All 3 pairs had to be fixed. I bought 3 pairs cause the first one broke and got to more just in case it broke again.
4.0,Big roomy hobo like purse.  Purse had a smell.  Put a tea bag in it and that worked to take the smell away.  I liked the color I got.  True as pictured.
4.0,it is hard to open the home screen thru the plastic but once you have it open works great ! Purse does not hold much else tho. Great for running errands
4.0,A very nice Summer robe.  A bit thin for a Midwest Winter.
4.0,"I purchased this coat on 3/20/15 and recieved it on 3/23/15. It wasn't expected to be delivered until 3/26-3/31, so I have to say I'm very impressed with how fast I recieved it! I ordered a medium because I'm usually in the small to medium range and it fits perfectly! I would definitely say go one size up from your original size. It's very light weight and thin but I knew that when I ordered it. I love how it looks while wearing it. The only flaw I have came across with it so far is that in the near future the buttons will need to be replaced because their not sown on as tightly as they should be. But I'm very pleased with this purchase and definitely recommend purchasing this coat!!"
4.0,"Quality good, everything I expected it to be."
4.0,Beautiful dress for any business
4.0,A+ both categories.  Will buy again
4.0,The heart is a little bulky. Its still pretty though
4.0,"I'd been looking for a black buckle with some sparkle for a jumpsuit I was making.  The ""Goldilocks"" buckle - not too big, not too small, etc.  This fit the bill.  I was a little disappointed in the quality for a sewing project - a little flimsy and each buckle had a sharp spot on the edge where it had been detached from the mold. I I trimmed those off on two and glued them together back-to-back to make a more substantial buckle. Made the belt and I loved it - it looks a lot more expensive than I feared.  I don't know why there are four in the package, maybe a non-sewing use? - but that allowed me to customize so I'm happy.  One star off for quality otherwise great!"
4.0,"The hat is very cute and is well made.  The plastic visor was very wrinkled.  I was able to remove the wrinkles by taking the visor off the hat, then lying it on the dashboard of my car on a hot day.  I smoothed it out every hour or so and it is perfectly smooth now.  The visor needs to be about 2 inch longer.  Notice in the photo, the visor is poking out when the hat is worn slightly back on the heat.  To achieve a better protection you must wear the hat flat on the head and that interferes with vision.  In the position shown in the photo you need to wear a mask.  I was hoping to avoid wearing the mask."
4.0,Fits great in my nose
4.0,The pajamas look just like the picture.  I am happy with the material and the way they are made.  Although they run a little small.  No problem with the seller and the package arrived when promised.
4.0,It doesn't feel cheap considering the price and the size chart image it's pretty accurate so I'd suggest you to pick your size based on it.
4.0,"I really like this purse. It is bigger than what I usually have, but it has three separate sections plus additional pockets and slots for organization. It is nicely trimmed in black and the top zips closed. Thanks!!!"
4.0,Nicely made for the price and the look was very cute. Just a little larger than I expected.
4.0,I'm pretty pleased with this suit. My only issue is that I have kind of a long torso and its not quite long enough.
4.0,these are too cute but they are actually bigger than i expected my baby had to grow a little in order to fit it lol
4.0,Nice shirt for price.
4.0,"I mean there‚Äôs nothing too special about it, it fits nice and doesn‚Äôt make my finger turn green. Decent"
4.0,"Pretty blouse but definitely runs a tad bit small and short, but i guess that shows in the photo."
4.0,Very pretty but quite large in size
4.0,What else is there to say...five year old approved.
4.0,Fit good cotton good.
4.0,"I love this purse. It has a lot of zipper pockets so you don't have to throw everything in there & dig for it. I like to just carry the essentials & this purse is a great size for everything I need to carry. The straps are adjustable do it can be a shoulder bag, cross body, or a clutch. Perfect for taking a purse out to the bar or somewhere where you don't want to be weighed down by a big bag!"
4.0,Nice great fit and it was a gift
4.0,decent quality fabric but runs a bit on the small side
4.0,I like the fit of the pants and they wash well with very little shrinkage.
4.0,The dress is cute and a good value for the money. I loved the pockets! Unfortunately it was much too small in the bust. It fit in the waist and shoulders but was not even close in the bust area. The next size up would be too big in the shoulders I believe.  I'm disappointed because it's very cute.
4.0,"These skirts run very small, Otherwise I love the material and that they don't have to be ironed. Just wash and dry, and wrinkles leave."
4.0,"These are a little small fitting which was great for me as my hands are very small, 4.25 ring size. Didn't snag or bunch up."
4.0,"Like many, I have problem feet.  I seem to have Band-aids on more toes than not.  I wondered if toe socks would solve the blister problem.  I tried Injinji but their weave is a bit heavy even in the lightest weave.  The Fila have a thinner weave which seems to work better.  So far so good."
4.0,"This is a very pretty round stone necklace.  The stones are all set well.  Unfortunately, the clasp does not work well.  It works very hard and it is hard to close.  While pushing it closed to prevent the necklace from falling off, I ended up breaking the chain as well.  The chain is thin, so it must not have been able to handle the force needed to force the clasp closed.  The stone itself is very pretty and I will probably be able to find a different chain for it.  The necklace came with a blue pouch for storage.  The zipper on the pouch works well.  There is also a care card that comes with the necklace."
4.0,The sun glasses is perfect for driving. This is the 2nd pair I've bought. The reason I gave a 4 starts is it's heavy. It's not good for wearing for a long time.
4.0,Nice construction but a little small for my wrist
4.0,got what I paid for
4.0,I do really like these jerseys but MAKE SURE you order at least two sizes larger than US sizes. Pay attention to their sizes listed.
4.0,I really like this - wish it was on a shorter chain
4.0,"I wore this to our company dinner and received a night-ful of compliments.  I am an average size 8 after 4 kids, and this was flattering (I recommend Spanx or the like as it does hug your curves).  The only downside (and why i took off a star) is that the portion that criss-crosses in the front and folds down around the shoulders and the back always wants to flip up.  This is an OFF THE SHOULDER dress (ALL the way off) and it looks ridiculous if you try to wear that folded part up and not down.  It would do well being tacked into place (i just pinned it).  Otherwise, very flattering."
4.0,Super easy to put on. works well in the field.
4.0,Very quick delivery. Very cute.
4.0,Nice comfy socks. There isn't much more to say about them.
4.0,They run a bit small but extremely comfortable and great customer service on the exchange for size!
4.0,"These are adorable but look small on my fat lobes, but that‚Äôs on me.  They were a gift to me. So as the giver,  I was pleased with how they looked, and would gift them to others.  As a gift receiver  I‚Äôm overly critical.  Therefore, I had to ignore my sarcastic comments and talk behind my back on how unappreciative I am."
4.0,"I like the chain a lot. The actual pendant part is a tiny bit blurry. Despite this, I still really like it considering the low price."
4.0,"lovely quality and very stylish ,but it fits a bit loose. Had to adjust to get the fit  wanted"
4.0,The colors look very faded and dingy
4.0,I received this today and was pleasantly surprised! It does have a little stretch but I would recommend going up two sizes - I'm 5'5 and wear a sz 14- I got the XXL. It fits great- hugs in all the right places!
4.0,"I bought this a little over a month ago and noticed the paint is starting to chip. I work from home so I rarely need to use my car, therefore I barely move/use my keys. The product itself is great, but the paint seems cheap. I'm not mad, just disappointed as it shouldn't be peeling with minimal usage. I'm planning on repainting it once the paint has fully fallen off."
4.0,"Odd since it's not a TOY but yeah. Arrived at least 3 weeks before scheduled timing, came with a broken chain that was easily fixed (the links became detached), and I really adore it, it's heavy, like a real pendant should be, and it's creative and cute. I wear it regularly and I have sensitive skin. Though it rubs and I wear it day long, no rash/reaction have formed, so I am really pleased."
4.0,"I needed a new pair of winter jammies, and this pair  of Woedpez Womens Pajama Set had pockets, so I was all for it. They arrived and the top is nice and roomy.  There's lots of room in the hips .  There's plenty of space in the waistband.  The disappointment came when I realized the elastic in the waistband wasn't properly sized for XL.  I like these so much that I will pick apart the stitches and cut the elastic.  Women's pajamas with pockets are usually quite pricey, so these were a good value."
4.0,"This is a very pretty little watch that has a lot of bling appeal. It looks so sparkly on and compliments many of my outfits. It's not too shiny, though. The Art Deco style is refined. It's not heavy and fits all with the adjustable clasp. The rhinestones are well-attached. It has a silver-tone face. It keeps time well so far. I deduct one star because it was already running when I got it, so I can't know how long it's been running, hence I don't know if it will have a short or long battery life. These inexpensive watches are great, but buying new batteries can add up. Overall. I'm pleased with my purchases."
4.0,"This watch seems to be a nice heavy and sturdy construction. I have a smaller wrist and was concerned it would be too big, but it seems to fit well. I am very glad I kept this watch and very pleased with the way it looks and feels.  It took me a long time to hit the purchase button when I was looking at this watch on different websites because there were no reviews or pictures from customers, so I added pictures that may help someone make a purchase decision.  The band is a very heavy rubber material with a large buckle.  It takes a little while to get comfortable with the weight and feel of this watch, but if you give it a chance I believe you will love it.  I came close to sending it back and buying a comparable Seiko or Citizen, but I'm really glad I kept this because it looks very rugged and classy on.  Bezel moves with a nice click and glass/crystal gives a little bluish color from the side.  It is holding the correct time with no second loss or gain compared to my satellite G-Shock which I set to match.  A few cons are I was not real impressed with the packaging/box it came in and I wish the Luminous stayed lit a little longer than it does, but it is very bright right after charging with light.  This is my second Swiss Legend watch and I have had no trouble with either.  It did not come with Amazon Prime shipping, but the free shipping did arrive very quick."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but works well and looks good
4.0,My husband like the way it fit him
4.0,"We bought it for our beach trip. It's a really big bag and that's why we decided to buy it. We were not disappointed when it arrived. There is enough room for all the junk you take to the beach.<br /><br />The side pocked was ripped on the inside, so stuff would fall out into the main bag area. It does have a very handy small bag inside that is attached and can not be separated. Good for room keys, phones, money, etc."
4.0,too big on me and very easily wrinkled.
4.0,"Loved this dress, until I washed it - shrunk big time.  Washed in cold water and hung to dry, no washing instructions on item.  My guess - needs to be dry cleaned. BUT, I'm buying it again and won't throw into washing machine...."
4.0,"Very nice sweater, perfect for weekends"
4.0,"Absolutely love the color and material! The only issue is it will show any imperfection in your body, so bigger girls like myself should order a size up if they want to avoid that."
4.0,It's lovely but a bit small.
4.0,Nice pairs of shorts. The elastic band waists make them slide down a little but overall awesome for the price!
4.0,"This will be my band for the next few months. Maybe more. It is really cormftable, specially after using the original bands, which i couldn't bare anymore. They were extremely uncormftable. These, from the moment I put them on, felt extremely good on my wrist, I even forgot I was using a watch. However, I don't take my watch off when I sleep, and today when I woke up, the band felt loose, just a bit though; but enough to slightly feel it falling sideways, which I dislike. Nonetheless they are still cormftable to use. No itchiness, no nothing, which is enough to overcome that loose feeling. This is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. I hope they don't strech anymore. I can't keep adding another hole as it becomes to tight. Overall, a good 4 star product."
4.0,"Lots of people can attest to the quality of the product based on how many great reviews this already has. I've only been using it for a couple of days and I already love it. Here are some things I didn't like and suggestions that I would make:<br /><br />-The price point for this product makes it a premium item at $89 on Amazon/$119 Retail. Considering the average duffel bag probably costs anywhere from $20 on the low end to $50 for a quality product, it is expensive.<br /><br />-[bigger or stretchier water bottle pocket] The water bottle pocket is a little too small. I always bring my blender bottle to the gym and honestly it fits perfectly but it seems to be stretching the nylon in the pocket to the max and it makes me feel like continual usage will cause this to rip.<br /><br />-[bigger cell phone pocket] The &#34;cell phone pocket&#34; is too small to realistically hold any cellphones. It would be perfect if you were trying to fit a Motorola Razr into there but this isn't 2003. Considering how large smartphones are these days, this is not a cell phone pocket but rather just an extra pocket you can put maybe your keys, gym card, etc."
4.0,It smells great! And it really help clean up my previous LV never full tote!  It is a small jar and a little expensive but a little dab goes a long way
4.0,Very disappointed with shipping promises as product arrived almost a week late and still charged me the expedited shipping fees :(<br /><br />Overall product was very nice and covered just what it should!
4.0,"Product arrived on time.  Product is exactly as described - actually, it's a little prettier than the picture.  Looks really nice with black slacks."
4.0,I bought this hat to protect my scalp from sunburn.  I wanted something lightweight that protected from the sun but didn't make me hotter.  This hat seems like it will work well.  It's light weight.  The brim is adjustable.  The top of the hat has a mesh lining that will hopefully let air flow.  I also like the string in case it's windy or I want to take it off it can just hang and not blow away and not have to be held.  For someone who doesn't look good in hats I thought this hat was pretty flattering.
4.0,Overall I really like this top. It‚Äôs fits true to size and is comfy. I‚Äôm a little worried about snagging the fabric though. I wasn‚Äôt positive what waffle knit was and it seems like one that would snag easily.
4.0,"Good value. You get what you pay for, but these are elegantly designed and work well. The finish isn't spotless, and the small but visible scratches on the clips are the reason for losing a star. Nevertheless, a good buy."
4.0,little small but looks awesome
4.0,"Wore this dress to church and it made me feel classy and lady-like. It fits as expected: with measurements 40-32-47, I used the size chart and selected the xl which fits just right. The material is not see through. My only issue is with the neckline as it is wider than expected and when not pulled taut, has a drooping effect which I did not like. Other than that, it's a great dress!"
4.0,So cute. I loved it! But it came broken. Had to return it
4.0,Nicer than I thought it would be. Good tie.
4.0,It's a nice shirt. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 215lbs. Just had a baby so I have a baby belly so all my shirts have to be loose around the stomach. The only reason I have this a 4/5 star was because the white is so thin it's see thru. I will be ordering the blue in this same size (2X) bc it fits nice.
4.0,"After reading other reviews, I decided to order a larger size.  I am glad that I did, otherwise it would have been too small."
4.0,"This dress had that nice, thick, almost satiny type of fabric typical of so many of these amazon dresses. Almost like a &#34;foam&#34;y fabric, for lack of a better term. I loved the colors and the length. The straps were really skinny elastic strings that criss cross in the back, offering no support whatsoever. It has a side zipper. The chest area didn't have enough of a &#34;cup&#34; shape to contain my boobs, so it ended up smashing them down in an unflattering way while at the same time allowing some fabric to flare out at other spots where you didn't't want it to be flaring, and it was extremely &#34;booby&#34; on me- too much boob for me to be comfortable with, especially smashed down like they were. If the boob areas were more conforming in shape, with a dart or 2 added to allow the fabric to &#34;cup&#34; the breasts a little more naturally, it would have worked better for me. The top &#34;fit&#34; me but the waist was big, probably by 2 inches, which could be fixed. The length was past my knees and the skirt was full and swingy and heavy. I ALMOST love this dress.  I am 39bust (36C/D), 31waist, 36hips, 5'3&#34;, 135lbs."
4.0,"Fits my room piercing perfectly. I wanted a curved barbell that didn't look longer on the bottom half, like the one I got it originally pierced with. However, since it was sent from Malaysia it took longer to arrive and the actual ear ring was much smaller then I thought. So unless you have very tiny ears and very tiny fingers, good luck getting this in your ear. It took me almost half an hour to figure out how to get the pinhead sized ball screwed on and therefore don't drop it.cause you will never find it."
4.0,"Great dress, stretchy material,  thin material perfect for summer. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'6&#34; 155lbs 34DDD/E. the only issue is where pink meets black the stitching is not stretchy so it is a bit difficult to get it over my bust but after that struggle everything fits perfect!"
4.0,Very comfortable and so far they stay put. Like them.
4.0,Very lightweight good to keep the bug bites away breathable.
4.0,"The hooks don't stay hooked. The material on the shoulders bunches up, does not stay smooth like in the pic. For me, anyway."
4.0,"I love this bracelet.  I think it's a bit pricey however, it's sturdy, easy to take off & put on and has the look of regular jewelry, with a nice big medic-alert emblem and large print medical &#34;Issue&#34; on the reverse.  Good purchase!"
4.0,Purchased for a gift. It is very pretty
4.0,I use them for food prep but also during this time of virus I carry them in my pocket for shopping and times that I feel I need protection for myself and others.
4.0,"Shirts are cute, and fit is about average, not generous.  Material is thin. I had to return most shirts because I ordered a size too small for my tall 11 year old granddaughter."
4.0,"Shipping was fast, wallet was as described. Love this wallet. Very pretty and holds enough to not have to take my purse. The only problem I had with it is that one of the card slots was ripped when it came and couldn't use it."
4.0,"Really like these socks, however they're too small for my calves!  They are a large!  Need XL."
4.0,"It is nice, but the material is thicker than I expected.  The sleeves are long and I am going to have the sleeves and the bottom of the dress taken in.  It needs to be taken in for the look I am looking for.  I would buy again, but I would make the same adjustments.  I love the BOW!"
4.0,"These socks are very good. They fit about as expected and they stay up all day long. They are soft, comfortable, breathable socks that didn't cause any sweating. They are snug in the right places for slight compression. These are all around good socks."
4.0,"exactly like picture, i did expect them to be a bit smaller but over all good earrings but didn‚Äôt blow me away. (definitely not for people with easily irritated piercings)"
4.0,The only thing that could make theses better is if the lining stayed put better when you pull your hand out.
4.0,Came nicely packaged. Got compliments first time I've worn them.
4.0,Nice luggage. Used it for the first time last week on a trip to FL. Survived 3 baggage handlers. Found a tear in the zipped cover on the smallest case.
4.0,My wife love the doggy bone. Only wish the clip was smaller.
4.0,"Nicely cast gold leaves.  Pearls extend well above and to the sides of the casting, so may catch fabric."
4.0,"I liked this band for my Active 2 watch, nice feel to it. I got it because ti was one of the only bands that ran small enough for me. The only issue I had a was the clasp would occasionally pop open, but I was given a replacement to resolve that issue. By the time I received the second band I had decided to return the watch entirely, so I never tested the new band."
4.0,"I was skeptical about buying this product at first after reading the reviews about them breaking, but they're great when they arrived. A bit too crumpled, but nothing that cannot be fixed. Some of the clips looked old to me. But it's a great set for just 8 bucks. It also comes with a cute bag to solve any storage problems."
4.0,"So far these compression socks have held up better than I anticipated. They have held their shape well, and remain just as tight and difficult to put on now as they were when I got them several months ago. Mind you, these are the tightest possible, and therefore they are tough to put on. Compared to the compression socks for sale in local pharmacies, these are pretty good quality and a lot cheaper. They are not thick, like the expensive ones."
4.0,"Doesn't breath well. otherwise, a great coat"
4.0,"This hat does the job, but it will only fit a small head, which is perfect for me, but others should be aware that this is NOT an adult size hat. It's very soft, pleasant to have on your head as it's light-weight."
4.0,I does what I expected.
4.0,It was a little tighter in stomach area
4.0,A little small but getting used to it.  They are great for driving and outdoor activities.
4.0,"This hoodie arrived on time and looked decent. I would have liked the graphic to be a bit more prominent, it seemed a little more washed out and faded than I would have expected for a brand-new item, but perhaps I'm splitting hairs. It looked great, and my daughter (who is a HUGE RWBY fan) was very pleased with it. The fit was perfect, although I had to guess because obviously my daughter is not a man (then again, in today's society....), so maybe that was more luck than actually using the sizing chart. The only other thing I was a bit disappointed about was that on the very first day my daughter wore it, the pocket stitching came apart on the left side. If not for that I would definitely give 5 stars."
4.0,"Follow the size chart.  I got lots of compliments on this.  LOVE the pockets!  A bit short but I had always intended on wearing with leggings anyway.  I wouldn't say it is high end quality, but it also isn't high end priced.  Great deal for the price!  I've given the link to several people because I have gotten so many comments on it.  I wish there was a valentine's version!"
4.0,"Good value but not exactly ""dry"" fit"
4.0,"I put this on my Timex Expedition watch.  Looks great and very comfortable.  I thought the $35 dollar price tag was a bit much.  But it was exactly like what I wanted so I took it.  If I never have to buy a watch band again, then it will be worth it.  We will see."
4.0,"Love the boots I ordered the wine color, they are just a touch of sass I ordered my size 7, they are a little narrow, but thin socks will be fine, can't wait to wear for valentines day!"
4.0,Waist is huge
4.0,Cute - but somehow the ruching looks more dramatic on the picture here than it does in person.
4.0,"Shirt is advertised as oversized, and it is, but that is what I was hoping for and I don't look like I'm swimming in it.  It's comfortable and the small is perfect for me (I'm 5'4&#34;, 130).  The fabric is not polyester as listed, but seems to be cotton."
4.0,Really like these except a bit small.
4.0,Love the neutral colors easy to match outfit.
4.0,"I love this top, but I can't give it 5 stars because the cayan color has a greenish tint and is not the blue color shown in the picture. It is a more warm color and I almost always wear cool colors. But the color is deep and vibrant and attractive, so I kept it. the material is very nice and it feels as it should. It comes down over my butt and I am 5'10&#34;."
4.0,"Comfortable enough. But it‚Äôs thin, not thick or lined like a lot of the other yoga pants. The price was lower than some. Nice quality, and soft, comfortable fabric. It does not show through! It‚Äôs just not thick."
4.0,Little small but good for the price
4.0,runs a little small if you have an ample chest. but very nice for business shell
4.0,"This is my go-to for work. I'm 5'3 and 128 lbs and got a small. I love how the top fits! The bottom isnt too flattering if you have a little belly, but Spanx fix that."
4.0,I wanted to love the swimsuit but my torso is just too long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and about 115. I ordered a medium and the fit was just right other than the length of the top. I‚Äôm a mama of 2 and was hoping for a top that covered my belly.
4.0,"These were given to me as a gift.  They are very cute, and comfortable.  Love the pockets in them, they are deep enough that my phone fits all the way down in them, so no chance of falling out"
4.0,It is not the best quality or the softest material but def worth what I paid for it.  Would order again.
4.0,Very cute.  Bra area fits a little big.
4.0,"Very soft, fits well, I will buy again"
4.0,"The mask was purchased for my 13 year old son. He really liked it a lot because it looked so realistic. However, when we wore it Halloween night in the dark... he had a hard time seeing through the eye holes."
4.0,I had a couple of these in high school and got a lot of compliments with them. I also use them on my daughter and they do the job of keeping the laces together. I just wish that the colors on them wouldn't chip so easily but other then that I would recommend it especially for kids!
4.0,"Really pretty, nice material, very soft. Pants a little long but I'm tall so not a huge problem. Used them under my clothes for a trip to Mammoth during a snow storm. Warm. Word great!"
4.0,"I like the shirt, just need to buy a larger size lol"
4.0,"The watch looks beautiful, but I need to adjust the band still, so haven't worn it yet."
4.0,"Overall they are an ok made set of glasses.<br />Build quality and material we're good. My problem was changing out lens. Seemed harder than it needed to be. The little plastic clip that secures the frame to the lens was kind of tricky to unhinge. That being said once it finally does release I was concerned it would snap off and the joined area. The joint would get weaker with every lens change. To their credit it has yet to break out completely. You get an awesome carrying case with, I believe four extra lens for different types of condition. Kinda look like something a Storm Trooper would wear on Holliday. Conclusion is they are a fine pair of shades with numerous options. You'll be happy with them."
4.0,"Nice, lightweight, comfy dress.  I consider it an around-the-house dress, though I suppose it would look better ironed and accessorized."
4.0,"Color is pretty and as described, material is spandex like and very clingy with no slip underneath .  Size 130 was a bit big for my tall 6 year old with a thin frame.  Length of dress was at knee."
4.0,Work very well.  Keep me looking sharp.  Minus one star because  you have to frequently bend them back into shape because they will loosen up and fall off over time.  I'd love to pay $5 more for something made with sturdier metal.
4.0,"I like the style a lot on this shoe.  Excellent for summer wear.<br /><br />I love the look, and they get looks!  great for the beach because the sand pours right out.  (but don't get them wet)<br /><br />The sole is very comfortable and has a little foam padding.<br /><br />The straps don't rub on my feet or toes!<br /><br />Love these sandals!!"
4.0,Pretty otherwise.  Keeps the sun off.
4.0,"Solid quality bands. Better than the one that came with my Timex Weekender, in my opinion."
4.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful but very I mean very long for the average person.  My daughter is 5'6-5'7 and we would have had to hem it a good 8-10 inches.  Perfect for a taller individual.  Loved it but just too expensive to get it altered.
4.0,"Fits TTS, ribbed material is nice and stretchy, but a bit thin.  For reference I am 5'6"", 130lbs and 32B, I had ordered a small and it fit."
4.0,"Very nice, packaged well. Great deal"
4.0,This shirt is off white.  Not a true white.  Like the little collar.  Bought medium- fits nicely.  5‚Äô3‚Äù - 140 lbs.
4.0,"This is a nice hat especially if you have a lot of hair that won't fit under an ordinary hat and you don't want it hanging down possibly in pool water. The only issue I have with it and that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the creases that were in the brim from packing and shipping were nearly impossible to get out. No amount of wetting and pressuring would get them out. It took a steam iron, twice but it finally smoothed out enough to the point that it could be worn.  Then did not prevent me from ordering another one, I just know the work that I have ahead of me. I think it's worth it."
4.0,Lovely dress but expected slightly different material
4.0,These were bought as a gift.  These are thin.
4.0,Okay...got this to prepare for my trip to New York this past weekend. Never been and the temp with wind chill was -12. Yep that is cold for someone that lives in a coastal southern city. Used this for 2 days in crazy wintry conditions. Snow rain and just overall frostbite type weather. Kept my face and head warm. Only thing that sucks...I wear glasses and when I covered my mouth and was breathing it fogged the lenses. Granted I had a stuffy nose and was breathing through my mouth. I bought 2 and the wife was hesitant to wear hers until that snow hit her in the face. She pulled hers out and it provided the relief she was looking for. Glad I bought this. Would suggest and recommend it to anyone.
4.0,"Bought this for a friend's wedding and just to have a nice top for going out. Just got this today, so I only tried it on. Haven't worn it out yet, so please keep that in mind. This review is based on having tried it on at home.<br /><br />I was debating between this brand and another brand which appeared to have the exact same shirt.  After reading many reviews, I decided that I'd rather just go with the cheaper brand (this one ended up being about $12 - $17 cheaper than the other brand, this one was 3 1/2 stars vs 4 1/2).<br /><br />Size:<br />I was mostly afraid that the size would be off since that seemed to be the biggest complaint, but the medium fit me fine. Before I ordered, I measured my dimensions and compared them to their sizes (don't use the normal sizing chart. In their description, they have their own sizing). I am 5'2&#34; and around 130lbs. I normally wear small or medium sized shirts. I feel that this medium size worked out well for me. The arm length and shirt length were good, and the top lace part fell correctly on my shoulders. I think a small would've been too tight under the arms.<br /><br />Quality:<br />I thought this would be a thicker lacy material (I imagined that the lacy top part would be thick enough to stay upright), but it is a softer thinner material. This is my own mistake as I didn't really read what it was made of. That being said, it does stay up okay. When it falls limp, just need to readjust it a little so it's flipping up and not down.<br /><br />The top and bottom scalloped edges have fringes that need to be cut so that the scallop is smooth.  I expected this from reviews, and don't mind trimming this off personally, but if you don't want to be bothered by that, they you shouldn't get this.<br /><br />The matching tube top is not a separate piece.  It is sewed to the shirt and is a soft thin t-shirt sort of material. It went all the way down to the bottom of the shirt. It was sewn closed on the bottom and sewed by the underarms. The top was not sewn closed on the front or back. Worked fine to cover up the skin.<br /><br />Smell:<br />Had a bit of a chemically smell to it or something, but nothing super bad. I imagine that I just need to give it a wash, and it'll be fine.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Was worth the price in my opinion, especially since the other one would've been almost twice as much. Very pretty lace!"
4.0,"There seems to be a certain direction to wear these and for them to be facing the correct direction on each ear, one must be turned backwards. That‚Äôs fine, however one side has texture and the other doesn‚Äôt so if you look closely that may disappoint some people. I don‚Äôt care if one ear has texture since it‚Äôs hrdly noticeable. Still a bit annoying.  Great look though."
4.0,Love it. Fits great and looks amazing.
4.0,The quality & price
4.0,"These earrings came super fast and are super cute, but i didn‚Äôt really realize how small they would be. It does say the size in the description so you should make yourself aware of how small they are. They also have kind of loose backings but that‚Äôs fine i just use backings from a different pair of earrings."
4.0,Even though its function is acceptable  i still wish leather was better quality however good for price
4.0,Cute. The arms are a little weird looking but it's a cute comfy shirt for everyday running around.
4.0,Matches the picture and fits well.. it's just extremely small.. almost looks like just a band
4.0,"bought size 38, I'm a size 7 1/2-8 and they're pretty snug. Fit better without socks, but I'm gonna look for some no- show thin socks to wear with them because my feet sweat a good amount. Very comfortable shoe."
4.0,"It was what I thought it would be, although material is a little thin."
4.0,"I'd been wanting a sexy little schoolgirl skirt for a while, and this one immediately drew my attention because of the adjustable velcro waist.  As a female with somewhat wide hips and thighs, it can be difficult (even with a size chart) to get sizing right when buying clothing online, and the velcro gives a the buyer a bit of wiggle room.  This skirt actually comes completely apart, so there is no bunch of material when adjusting the velcro.<br /><br />I ordered the medium, which states it is made for hip measurements around 38-39.5 inches around, and my hips are 38 when measuring around the band of my underwear.  I expected the skirt to fit with the velcro strips flush against each other, or maybe having to tighten it a bit, but to my surprise it actually fit on the small side when trying to fit the velcro strips right on top of one another.  This means that when wearing it, some velcro is visible around my waist, but that's not a huge deal.  I feel like the large would have been too big as far as the amount of skirt material though.  Just be aware that at these measurements, you may have a bit of velcro visible on the waist.<br /><br />The skirt is very cute, and the bottom edge allows a little bit of cheek to be seen (definitely a provocative piece of clothing, as a heads up to anyone who might be looking for a truly innocent skirt, haha).  I would definitely hand-wash this item (as it states online), as some of the threads came out upon handling the skirt, so I'm not sure just how sturdy the seams are.  Overall, I like this skirt.  The only issues I have seen thus far are the loose threads and the slightly confusing sizing.  I do think this is a good deal for the price it's offered at!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I will not rate items highly if they don't deserve the rating, and I write these lengthy reviews to help out fellow shoppers, since I always read reviews on products before buying."
4.0,"Okay so I definitely thought these were just earrings‚Ä¶. It is an entire piercing gun with earrings lol. Hopefully I can just take the earrings out with no problem, without having to pierce."
4.0,Runs a little small but loved it
4.0,a lot smaller than i imagined but they are still really cute! i pair them with the iGirl necklace to spice up a fit
4.0,I ended up returning these because they were too short.  I am 5'8&#34; and the ankle elastic was fairly tight and hit about 3&#34; above my ankle.  When I moved the elastic rode up making the pants look like capris.  The fabric was good quality and the waist was extremely comfortable.  I liked that the pants had functioning pockets too.  Had the pants been a bit longer or the elastic looser I would have happily kept them.  Even if I had put in elastic in myself they still would have been a bit short.
4.0,This was a birthday gift for my adult granddaughter. She was very happy with it.
4.0,For great! It was perfect for what i was wearing it too!
4.0,Very nice . Match the robe perfectly a little long for shipping so be warned if need for Christmas order early !!
4.0,"I like the product but I wished it had two pins in the back so it won‚Äôt spin upside down as much; but other than that,  I‚Äôm satisfied with it."
4.0,"Well made and Cushie, but a little snug as I wear a size 14 shoe."
4.0,"Jus buy it, you won't regret"
4.0,Bought for a Christmas gift don‚Äôt know how it fit but he liked it
4.0,Runs smaller than expected. However beautiful color and cute style.
4.0,"Love the bright colors.  Ordered a small and if it's perfect like the stretch on it, I am 5'3,130 nd get  many compliments. Price is great"
4.0,"The top is cute and comfy, the bottoms were kind of weird with some extra material, but still good quality for the price"
4.0,"I think these are super stylish and I always get compliments when I wear the rose gold ones! I think they‚Äôre really current and stylish. Although I personally wish the lenses were a bit bigger, that‚Äôs my personal preference. I often find myself still squinting when the sun is out, which leaves me questioning; is there actually protection or are these just for show?"
4.0,"The eye patch was a has tight, but I have a big head so can't complain. The patch Is sturdy and very old school. The cap is a good collectors item."
4.0,"Great design and quality, haven't worn yet. Thank you for designing a belt for those of us with big stomachs."
4.0,I usually dismiss complaints about a clothing tag bothering someone but I have to say this is the only con. The tags are there to stay unless you cut a hole in the material. Tagless Ekouaer Tagless.
4.0,"OH I AM SO HAPPY I ORDERED THESE!! These fit perfect and they aren't too heavy. The heaviness feels nice but it isn't like too much. The flares are a perfect size.<br />The only reason I rated 4 stars is because right when I took them out of the package they were dirty. There were hardened finger prints on the jewelry and I thought that was pretty gross..but other than that, I love these plugs!"
4.0,Quality is great but one wasn't strong enough to lock
4.0,Nice color. Nice fit. Smells weird though.!
4.0,el producto llego en muy buen estado y bien empaquetado la entrega se realizo en el tiempo estipulado estoy muy satisfecho con el producto.
4.0,They came in great! I did not expect them to be as large as they were. I also didn‚Äôt know that the design wouldn‚Äôt be on both sides but I do love it though!
4.0,I‚Äôm a little skeptical of the fit - a little tighter around the middle than expected. Cute at the top though. Good dupe.
4.0,"I loved it, but the link will eventual fall off your wrist and you'll lose it like I lost mine."
4.0,"Yip, this bigger grid is the one I should have gotten in the first place. Love it!"
4.0,"estoy muy contento con mi producto, es un producto de muy pero muy buena calidad y lo estoy disfrutando;la verdad lo he recibido  en el tiempo estimado,y  mi esposa esta  feliz,lo &uacute;nico  q no me  gusta  es que en amazon al embalaje inicial del producto se le a&ntilde;aden alrededor  de una libra con el embalaje  de amazon, deber&iacute;an de usar  un empaque un poco mas liviano al usual,por lo dem&aacute;s  estoy muy contento  con mis compras  por  ac&aacute;,espero  tomen en cuenta mi opini&oacute;n para futuros empaques,saludos y &eacute;xitos[[ASIN:B004OA74B0 VTech CS6419-2 DECT 6.0 Digital Two Handset Cordless Phone System with Caller ID]].LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE EN LA COMUNIDAD!!!!"
4.0,"Fits as expected and i love the hat, Four stars only because it was a different hat but i still loved the design."
4.0,"I got this necklace as I have a feeling I‚Äôll need protection from ‚Äúevil eyes‚Äù. It‚Äôs cute, but not sure if it will tarnish. Will update if anything changes.<br /><br />UPDATE: my necklace never tarnished HOWEVER, the chain broke :-( I bought another one to replace it because I loved it so much!"
4.0,cute for christmas time but you cant wear them very long they are heavy
4.0,"the fabric is good, it is a very beautiful dress. It is adjusted to the body"
4.0,Just a little see-thru
4.0,I liked the new design with square tubing and the 360 degree swivel. Hopefully will provide the sturdiness it requires. Not impressed with the cranking mechanism; could be more sturdy but time will tell. Have only had it opened once so far because of weather?
4.0,"I am getting older and wiser and start staying away from tight fitting pants. But in order to keep pants ""up"" this requires suspenders. I picked these since they are so stylish and fashionable indeed.  They are easily adjustable and I do like the color.  I like the fact that they come with two clips per location, looks a little more impressive. The faux leather is very noticeable, but it is what it is. Happy with the purchase."
4.0,This is really cute it looks like Kumatan from bunnys Cafe. It does get a little defected but no squishy is perfect. I love this squishy and it smells great like strawberriesüçì!!
4.0,super cute used it for a gift
4.0,"This is a good shrug to have. But I would say it would work at its optimum for a certain body type. My chest area is a little on the heavier side so when I wear this, it doesn't sit well around the armpit area. It bunches up around my shoulders and my under arm area is exposed."
4.0,"I like the fit, material, and the fact it has a filter pouch. Filter pouch was not seen so filter fell right through."
4.0,"They are good, just avoid the dryer üòû"
4.0,Great leather belt. I'd suggest ordering one size smaller although it's easy to make it shorter if you need. It is NOT a dress belt. It definitely has more casual look and would better work with jeans. It's kinda wide too. Good quality but not for formal pants for sure.
4.0,"These run small, so size up. Color is nice and bright and otherwise the fit is nice. Just should have gone up a size."
4.0,"Really cute hat. A little tight on my five year old's head, but she does have kind of a big head (she gets it from her father). It will be perfect for her Amelia Earhart Halloween costume. I was concerned with shipping because the description said two weeks and after ordering on Sept 30th, it said to expect it Oct 27-Nov 17; however, it was actually delivered on Oct 14th."
4.0,This was great and exactly like it was pictured. The only thing is that it slightly started to turn my neck green after wearing for over a week or 2 straight. Other than that it is an awesome purchase and its beautiful.
4.0,"This apron was a gift to my sister in law, she is  a ""Leo"" and she likes everything with lions on it. She is not going to be using it for cooking, she has a beauty shop, so she will be using it when she is working there, cutting hair, hair coloring, manis and pedis. She is very happy with it, I will say that i will recommended ."
4.0,Great pattern & material!  A little shorter than expected.  Often wear it as a long shirt with shorts.
4.0,What can you say not much tell
4.0,"Its cute, but there isn't any underwire for support. You'll need to fill the top completely in order for the two top lines to pop on your cleavage. If not , than, it's pretty loose at the top without any way of adjusting."
4.0,I like the style and the tint on these but the frames felt like cheap plastic sunglasses. I was expecting a bit more sturdiness and weight to these.
4.0,they are just what I wanted. Thank you.
4.0,"My daughter loved them and are comfy. They run a little small, wish I would've order a size bigger. I'm definitely ordering a pair for next year now!"
4.0,"I searched the internet for a purple cross body purse that was small enough to be comfortable but large enough to hold my large cell phone, keys, wallet, etc. Even my kindly fits. This was the only one which seemed to be the right dimensions and indeed it is. My old purse just wasn't large enough. I would have preferred real leather and slightly longer strap but at 5'2"" I can make it work."
4.0,like it a lot- took a star off because the bottoms are a slightly different color
4.0,I wear a size 5 ad this must be a 6 because it's way too big. Gave a 4 star for that reason
4.0,"They're very comfortable and tough, rather thin for wearing by themselves. Make good liner socks."
4.0,It fit perfectly on her! Only thing missing was the necklace. But I would still definitely recommend this product!
4.0,"Seems to be sturdy and durable.  I loaded it up and the shoulder straps cut into my shoulders.  I was intendeding to take it on a camping trip but I have more great than will fit in this bag, they must be including outside pockets to get to the 50 liter mark. It's tall but narrow on the sides and appears to tapper upwards."
4.0,Runs small & shrinks
4.0,"Beautiful dress. She likes it allot. Old timey look and feel to it. Very soft and comfortable. It comes with a sash/belt to tie around the middle. The large is a little snug for larger busted women. Besides that it fits well.<br /><br />Relying on other's reviews I see written is important to me when making purchases; so being very honest with my own, is just as important.<br />It has become a hobby and makes my day if it helps others!<br />If you have any questions or comments please feel free to ask.

4.0,"The bracelets are fine, would have liked to pick the color stone that went in. Like maybe a birthstone. Other then that they're great."
4.0,It was a beautiful dress fit perfectly but it didn‚Äôt come on time so I had to return it
4.0,a little big ordered a size 10 but can wear it on my right hand nice looking ring and for the price would buy again .
4.0,"comfortable and and pretty lavender color, little tight around the ankle"
4.0,I have larger thighs and am pretty short so I ended up looking like a clown? Product is nice- I like I color- they're just not flattering on me.
4.0,"Like the style, but fits a bit small for me. Planning to return."
4.0,Light weight and fuzzy warm not meant for really cold temps
4.0,Loved the colors and they have a very good reflection so cars are sure to see you when running at night! Fits just a tad bit tight but I don‚Äôt mind because it ensures that it‚Äôll stay in place while running
4.0,"Good watch, is a little larger than I like but overall good"
4.0,This was given as a gift so I don't have &#34;wearing&#34;experience but it looked good.
4.0,this dress was bigger than expected and didnt fit well at all. VPL all the way
4.0,"SUPER CUTE! the only potential problem, is that i have a bigger butt, so it may ride up or look a little short from the behind if you‚Äôre anything like me. otherwise, the color was so cute and i‚Äôm already thinking of all the possible outfits to wear with them!"
4.0,"Es de estilo playa, s√∫per sencillo, la talla corre grande"
4.0,"Very pretty comfy dress. The only drawback is that it had a very strong, nauseating, chemical smell when it came out of the bag. After one wash most of the smell is gone and I anticipate it should be ok after that."
4.0,"My daughter got this for Xmas and she loves it. Except to sleep, she wears it almost all day long. The unicorn look is the girly thing right now and and it does keep her warm; and it's so soft. It is a bit large on her, but that doesn't impact its use. Makes a great gift!!!"
4.0,"This top is cute, i normally wear a US size XXL or size 18/20, So naturally I purchased the XXL, unfortunately this top runs just a little bit small. I can still wear it but i'm almost out of my comfort zone on tightness. I was hoping that it would be longer too. Seems like the measurements are off a few inches. In the picture it looked longer. I might return."
4.0,Good Product üëç.
4.0,"These gloves kept my hands warm in below zero temperatures, and are also very comfortable.  I love them.  The only thing possibly wrong with them is they seem to collect lint easily.  Roomie enough for a wider hand, but cozy enough for a thiner one."
4.0,"Comfy ,fits well . Decent weight altho not as heavy as the average  sweatshirt. Like the way it looks and it's  great  for around the house wear."
4.0,"I've got a couple of these. Love the fabric. My only issue is some very slight inconsistencies in sizing. Not enough to say that one &#34;fits&#34; and the other doesn't, but enough to notice the difference in the way they're cut around the arms.<br /><br />But for the price and quality of the material, I can certainly live with this."
4.0,really cute. Bought as a gift and it was very much enjoyed
4.0,My daughter loves these but they do seem to run about a half size small - especially since all the other crocs I‚Äôve ever bought for my daughter have run on the big side.
4.0,Good watch. I hope it lasts. It‚Äôs my 3rd weekender. They all died fast. I bought this because it‚Äôs waterproof. Hopefully that helps.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:17370fc0bcdd09f05f38748197a7f5bd]] Super stretchy pants with a groovy pattern. I got these bell bottoms for a costume. I usually wear size 10-12 women's pants and ordered a large. They fit but the elastic cut in a bit at the waist and the fabric was stretched pretty tightly over my thighs. The fabric is sturdy but almost see through in the tighter fitting areas. Any undergarments would show, so I wore slip shorts underneath - which gave a seamless look.<br />Being 5'5"", these pants are at least 4"" too long. I temporarily ""hemmed"" them by using safety pins and double-side garment tape. I was able to wear them for one night, but they need to be hemmed permanently.<br />They worked for a costume but are not the most comfortable or best fitting. I would recommend ordering a size up to account for the thinner fabric and tight waist elastic, but expect them to run long.<br /><br />#bellbottoms #blackandwhite #costume #willandkaraleigh<br /><br />Please click the >> Helpful &lt;&lt; box below if this review helped You! =^D"
4.0,"I really like these underwear, very comfortable and breathable. They do run a bit large."
4.0,"I love the material on these sets. They're soft and seem like they would last long. However, I'm giving it four stars because when it arrived, there was a hole in the scarf. Not a huge one. Other than that, I would have given five. The other two sets I ordered arrived perfectly fine, no tears or holes or anything. These are great"
4.0,"Other reviews are correct on the wrinkling; not even the dryer will take them out. However, if your sizing is correct, most of them will smooth out when you put it on.  By far an elegant and flattering addition to my wardrobe.  I will buy in more colours for sure!"
4.0,"These shoes are just as nice in person, I ordred one size up due to toe separation and it worked for me."
4.0,It's very pretty the qualities very poor. o clock can you ask for the price.
4.0,Size was small
4.0,"These are really pretty and I love the natural stones. I have fairly small wrists, but these were actually a bit tight on me, so I will be gifting them to teen nieces."
4.0,Comfortable and good for the price.
4.0,"Most slippers have a full leather bottom, these only have toe and heel. But they fit well and easy to don. For the price, i would buy again."
4.0,"It's good , i like it"
4.0,It made me feel sexy since I gain a little weight
4.0,"I've gotten many compliments on this, definitely a show stopper. No one would imagine what I paid for it. Will probably purchase the silver now."
4.0,still breaking them in
4.0,This luggage strap held my luggage snuggly and securely. It‚Äôs so sturdy I think my luggage would not open even if the luggage zipper failed. It is a little hard to put on but the directions for installing are easy to follow.
4.0,"Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty and comfortable maxi dress.  The color combination of the cream, taupe, and black is both striking and casual.  The length is the perfect maxi length on my 5'8"" frame, hitting me at the ankles.  The sleeve length is nice as well, hitting right at my wrists.  The scoop neck is just below the base of my neck, and I love that it has pockets.  The cut is nice and flowy too.  The issue is the color blocked design itself.  The combination of the high waistline and the layout of the colored sections create a decidedly maternity look.  I am a size 16 with only a bit of a belly, and my husband was honest enough to tell me this dress makes my look like I'm expecting (I asked him to be 100% truthful.)  If you have even a little bit of a belly on you, you might want to reconsider this one."
4.0,The band works for what it is and is reliable in the locking part. But the pins seem really cheep I'm just happy my joints don't move much when I have it on.
4.0,I needed this fast and it arrived in time for the birthday surprise. I'm glad I can still find these charms. Thanks.
4.0,look and feel good.
4.0,I like the way it fit. The only thing I don't like about it is the padding in the bra. But then again all plus size bathing suits these days have horrible padding in the bra. It feels very unnatural up there so I would like it better if it didn't have all that padding. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that it looks good on me and it's what I expected.
4.0,The insole SUCKS!!!!!!!!
4.0,So soft and comfortable. Graphic is done so nicely !
4.0,This dress is wonderful. Size is a bit small.  Got my size fit snugg.  Felt great but zipper didn't do snugg.  Returned for a bigger size.  Little more flowy.... But zipper stayed.  Got the dress for a drama event.  Will buy again if I need flowy dress. üòÅüòÅ
4.0,Just as expected.  Good fit.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but bigger in the chest area."
4.0,little tight for high arches
4.0,Cozy socks that fits perfectly
4.0,This purse is a great size. The handle fits over my jacket perfectly and it's very pretty with tons of pockets on the outside. My only complaint is that the inside pockets are way too short compared to other purses on the market. All of my items which I would normally put in these two pockets just fall right out and I then lose them to the bottom of the purse.  Deeper or longer pockets on the side are a must!! No one wants to search for items that have fallen out!! Fix that and 5 stars for sure!!
4.0,"These are adorable! We bought these for our 6 year old niece in hopes that they would be small enough for her tiny, newly pierced ears. They are a bit big for her, even though they are described as ""extra small"" I think they would be perfect for a tween or older gal!"
4.0,"Perfect for a quick, small gift for someone. Bought for my brother's girlfriend who loves pets. I hope she likes them."
4.0,"Cute, but made my face sweaty. Didn't end up wearing."
4.0,Good quality. Only problem arrived late after halloween.
4.0,"So cute but a drop small. The girls were 10 yrs old & it just sat on top of their heads. Regardless of the fit, the girls all LOVED their &#34;artist hats&#34; & the berets were a big hit!"
4.0,"doesnt hold too much, but it is what it is. not sure if it works cuz kinda hard to check. built pretty sturdy."
4.0,"This fit fine once I got it on, but had to have second set of hands to help with straps on the back. This was my only issue. super comfy!"
4.0,"The construction of the band is really good. And really like the link removal stuff included. The face is a little tight to get in and out, and I feel the clasp is backwards, but minor issues."
4.0,It fit as expected and it is a good looking shirt I‚Äôve had some compliments on it I really like it
4.0,"Very pretty. Beautiful pattern, soft fabric. Would buy more in other colors. Definitely size up though."
4.0,"This organizer is great! I have a VERY small bathroom, but I do have two mirror cabinets that open. All my stuff has been crammed in those. This organizer is simple to put together and you can adjust the shelves to whatever height you want to accommodate taller bottles. It spins cleanly and easily.<br /><br />It's all clear plastic and feels a bit cheap, but we'll see how long it lasts. I imagine as long as I'm careful with it and don't cram too much junk on it, it'll be ok. Overall, if you're limited on bathroom space, then I highly recommend this."
4.0,My grandkids loved their watches
4.0,"These gloves do what they're supposed to. The only complaint is that they are a little difficult to get on and off. Other than that, they're great."
4.0,It was a Father's day gift for my father from my son and he loved it!
4.0,These hats would have been much warmer with a inner liner of fleece. Otherwise these are good.
4.0,"I'm enjoying this dress, if you want to call it that.  I just wanted something comfortable and it definitely is.  Fits as expected."
4.0,"Gets 4 stars because it doesn't stand up like in the photo... flops over just a little, but it has A LOT OF SPACE which i like cuzzo carry my big headphones around"
4.0,"I regret my color choice, long sleeved and white wasn‚Äôt my best decision ever. But it fits great."
4.0,Love my new hat. fits a little tight but will do. thanks so much...
4.0,Tiny.  Followed sizing guide but it‚Äôs a good size too small.  They are gorgeous so am keeping them in the hope I love se weight sometime.
4.0,Quite nice with high quality stitching.  Looks good!
4.0,"I bought this for traveling and it's just right for that purpose. My passport,  phone , cards,  cash and a couple of cosmetics all fit comfortably.  I have a Galaxy Note 4 with a cover on and it fits into one of the larger pockets with room to spare. The smell isn't nearly as bad as others have found it and I'm sure it will dissipate quickly. I plan on using it as an evening clutch after my trip. It does look a little cheap, which is, why I gave it only 4 stars,  but for the price it's to be expected."
4.0,Nice pair of earrings they are a good size I wish they were a little bigger but other than that they are good.
4.0,"Fits well, appears comfy, but the bow is definitely not centered on the back.  Serves it purpose & still looks cute."
4.0,"Advantage is the slots for your id, credit, debit cards.  Can fit phone, keys, cards, gloss, pen and comb."
4.0,Liked it but too small
4.0,"Returned because it was too tight around neck for plus size girl. Also, it was very wrinkled."
4.0,"Was happily received by my 16 yr old granddaughter...company helped track!... awesome service, awesome product"
4.0,"Usually wear a small or medium, ordered medium, received large, but that's a good thing. They fit well and aren't way too long."
4.0,"These PJ's are nice, fit is good and washed well. No pilling or shrinkage. They are warm, but not heavy. 2 pair for the price is a pretty good deal. I am considering buying again."
4.0,Looks nice however the big eye is kind of freaky.
4.0,Nice shirts just run small in size compared to what I am used to
4.0,"It's a nice band, but the slots are too far apart for minute adjustments. I like to cinch my watch down when I'm exercising and loosen it up for daily wear. There just isn't enough adjustment in this band for that."
4.0,Well made & cute. I don‚Äôt normally wear a xxl. Glad I ordered up a few sizes.
4.0,"I love these belts! They don't show under shirts like buckles do, and do a great job of tightening my pants. It does pull at the belt loops when tightened enough for it to work properly.<br />One downside, the adjustment piece has a sharp edge that I had to smooth on each pair. Easily fixable, but annoying to have to fix.<br />Either way, I would recommend the belta."
4.0,"It's lovely, but it's a little small around my hips. I'm keeping it, tho."
4.0,Tough stainless steel
4.0,"This is a really pretty scarf/necklace.  There are a few things to note...<br />The pendant is a lot bigger than what I thought it would be almost to the point of overwhelming the scarf, but somehow it works.<br />It can be a bit heavy for the scarf so just be aware when you wear this if it slip a bit you may want to readjust it before it falls completely off.<br />The scarf is a very thin materiel, be careful it does not catch on anything as I think it would tear rather easily and it is obviously not meant to keep you warm.<br />I have the black and white color which is very nice and could go with a variety of outfits from casual to semi formal.<br />All the stones on the pendant seem secure and are not loose, they catch the light nicely and the scarf has a bit of shimmer to the material.<br />This is a very nice product for the price you pay and I am happy I purchased it."
4.0,I love this top it is well made but wow does it fit small.  So buyer beware. I was able to stretch it out washing by hand so I kept it as it's such a good quality shirt .
4.0,"Overall, a great product.  Bathing suit looked exactly as pictures portrayed, colors and everything.  Bottoms were a little snug and top could have been a little tighter.  Only complaint is that the tie strings on the top started to come apart the first time I tied it."
4.0,The jacket is beautiful but runs small!  Sad thing is that it was just  Crammed  in and folded in  a Small plastic bag !! I am exchanging for a larger size!
4.0,"Price for the most, more color options would be nice."
4.0,They are a little long.
4.0,This was a gift for my sis and she loved them
4.0,I love these boots!  The look is great!  The fit is true to size.  Material a little thin... would not wear them in the rain.  But the look is fab!
4.0,"Really nice detail, well finished, tiny studs, perfect for child.  The backing is too small to handle and seems flimsy.  If they came with a slightly bigger backing I would have rated 5 stars.  My 12 year old niece loves foxes and I'm sure she will enjoy these."
4.0,"One of the velcro straps stopped sticking. Otherwise, it is a very nice trainer for the price. The quality is really good, it‚Äôs just that darn velco strap, that stopped sticking. Lol"
4.0,Perfect under my cloak for my handmaid‚Äôs tale protest costume.
4.0,Soooooooo soft and flowy.  Just what I wanted.  I could always use more drape.  I love drape.  But this is just fine.
4.0,I love dragons.  These earrings make a statement. A little less massive looking in person. The reason for only 4 stars is that the clip on both pairs of my dragons were bend closed. I opened the lips and they fit just fine. There is only one clip to ear per dragon.
4.0,"I bought this for a Poison Ivy costume and it is a really great bodysuit. The color of the velvet is exactly as pictured and it is really soft. The back of it where it ties together is really cute but you have to tie it really tight to keep the front from falling down and the shape is really flattering on the butt if you're only wearing the bodysuit. The quality is really great but there is just one place under my armpit where the stitching is coming undone, but I can fix it. Overall this is super cute and I would buy this in every color"
4.0,"These are pretty good.  The colors look great.  Although I am curious if the paint will chip off or become scratched easily.  I haven't seen it happen yet, so perhaps not.  The hold isn't great.  Sometimes my tie has more movement than I would like.  That being said, it holds much better than some tie clips I've seen.<br /><br />The colors are great and the price is fantastic.  Even if they don't hold up for a long time, I love this set for the price."
4.0,"Its cute, but its a  little boxier than you would expect."
4.0,I love how soft and comfortable.
4.0,"This is the perfect, delicate kind of necklace I have been looking for!  It's very small, so it will not overpower an outfit and can be worn as a daily piece of jewelry.  I gave 4 stars because the chain of the necklace I ordered broke within the first few wears, but I contacted the seller through Amazon and they were quick to make it right by sending me a new one!"
4.0,"Tried these one in a store, they are about half a size big. Feel weird for about a week, after that they're great. Really light, feel like a running shoes. They're were a little cold over the winter, but being cool in the sumer is more important to me.<br /><br />They wore out faster than I think they should have for the $170 I spent at the time... I just bought a second pair though, so worth it."
4.0,fits the controller perfect but doesn't leave quite enough room for the cable or headphones. If it was about 1/2 inch deeper it would be perfect.
4.0,"Just what I expe ted. It's a little thin, but for summer or for layering it's very nice."
4.0,"just a little large, but otherwise good product."
4.0,Really cute. I only wish some of the colors were prettier.
4.0,I ordered an XXL and I'm 5'10 and wear between a 14-16. Was just a tad snug but I can wear this skirt higher up on my waist and it still look good. Falls right to my knees. Material was not what I expected but I still really like it.
4.0,they are cute and they work.  they keep my head warm and they look nice
4.0,I bought it for my husband but it fit too snuggly so I gave it to my son and he LOVES it! He wears it everyday to school.
4.0,Nice bracelet at good price.
4.0,"The band is ok, not bad for the price you pay. Was expecting more but was not surprised. The leather is basic and so far is well."
4.0,Bought this for my nieces 16th birthday I was a little disappointed because you could hardly see that it said sweet 16 on it and the little diamond or whatever it is it‚Äôs like a speck of salt was not worth the year that amount of money paying almost $40 for
4.0,Nice polishing clothes.
4.0,Love this apron and have it in other colors. This one however is not true to color but more of a very light tan and not brown as expected.  Going to keep it and give as a gift.
4.0,"it's good,although I wear a size 7 1/4 it was very snug"
4.0,"Nice sweater, fits as expected, form fitting.  It does tend to grow in the sleeves.  They seem to grow long throughout the day."
4.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful, but needs to air dry. It‚Äôs very comfy, but not for super warm days. Blend holds heat more than a typical tee."
4.0,"I love this tank! It is just like the one in the Ant Man movie!!! It is heavy, but not too big. I was pretty disappointed when It didn't turn into a real life size tank... But it still looks good with my keys :)"
4.0,"It's presented with a little card, a lovely gift box and a pink velvety bag. Definitely meant as a gift, and inside all that, a delicate pair of necklaces combined into one. Perfect with my low-cut black evening dress."
4.0,"I liked it but it ran kind of small. I was looking for a slouchy sweater, and this is more fitted."
4.0,Not much give. But I loved it. Used it for a Seaworld trip and it was so comfortable and breathable.
4.0,Beautiful but a little too heavy.
4.0,"A little big in the chest, but over all, it's a nice blouse. I wear a medium, and that's what I ordered. Little tight in the arms, but it's not uncomfortable."
4.0,Son de buena calidad y son c√≥modas.
4.0,I really like itüòä
4.0,They fit fine and is comfortable but wish there was a heal to it.  Only issue I could see is if you have 10+ shoe size it might be a bit tight. I‚Äôm a size 9 and it fit perfectly; no extra space.
4.0,"This is hard to use, but way better than not having one to put bracelets on.  I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,Needs to be a little larger for fitting over face and neck.
4.0,"Really nice fit, and love the style. Wish toddlers don't grow out of things so fast."
4.0,I like it. It is light and comfortable.
4.0,Shirt fabric felt better than the pants but both doable. It looked cute!
4.0,came as advertized. Couldn't track package though. Info not given.
4.0,Pretty but slip down my nose.  I like these sunglasses but I want a pair that don't slip down my nose.  Also? I was looking more for a movie starlet quality not a top gun look.  Overall? These glasses are really nice but a bit too big for my face.  I love the color and quality though.
4.0,great quality...sizing is toward the smaller side..i have twins almost 4 years old they are small...my taller daughter was a little small with this size...worked for our wedding probably wont get to wear to much longer.
4.0,Runs big... I normally would have ordered XL but had tried on a Large before ordering and it was perfect.<br />However it arrived with a run across the back....
4.0,"Suit is cute, hat is too flimsy and isn't really wearable"
4.0,"Purse straps often fall into disrepair. You could ditch everything and get a new purse or handbag, but if the purse or bag itself is still fine, why not salvage it instead? This VanEnjoy Pair Genuine Leather Purses Strap Handles Replacement is designed to do exactly that.<br /><br />You get a pair of straps with this set. The straps are made with cowhide leather, and they utilize a lobster clasp. There are two so, depending on your needs, you could use both on a single purse or use one each on two different purses or bags. Two is best for purses, and it makes gripping and holding better, but you could go with one depending on the type of bag.<br /><br />The lobster clasps on these straps take some effort to squeeze, but once in place, they seem to grip well and are unlikely to come loose, since it does take effort. The clasps are a brass- like color, which means they should match well with just about any purse.<br /><br />If your purse straps or handbag straps are worn out, this set by VanEnjoy could be just what you need. So far everything seems okay, but only time will tell if they hold up, they way I hope they will. They are good from what I can tell, especially for this price point."
4.0,Very cute.  Looks like it runs small.  Glad I ordered a size larger.  Not a heavy fabric.
4.0,"Good quality. Gift for my 14 yo daughter, she loved it."
4.0,"Just got them today. They're cute, and they seem pretty durable, but I can't give them 5 stars because they are not true to size. I got a size 6 for my son and they're smaller than his size 5 sneakers. I would say order a size up."
4.0,"A lot smaller than I thought, but I'm using it for college so it actually works out great for me!! Fits my small laptop & charger along with some notebook sprials & pencils."
4.0,"Nice cap. Very well made with nice quality material. Only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because even with the snaps adjusted correctly in the back, it feels a big large on my head (loose around the ears). If you bend the brim into a duck bill it fixes it a tad, but I like to wear the brims a bit flatter these days."
4.0,Nice but a little sheer. Im 5'7 with a very curvy top at 36FF and a size 12. IT stretches well with a good length. The dress did shrink in the dryer.
4.0,"The rope broke him out, got a new chain and he is great"
4.0,It's just adorable but she'll probably just get a few months wear out of it but I couldn't get it off her
4.0,"Cheap, took awhile to get here, but really pretty."
4.0,"Muy bonitos y las luces geniales, pero no duran mucho, r√°pido se descomponen"
4.0,"These were better than I expected for the price! They looked great with our Halloween costumes! The only complaint I would have is that some of them aren't double sided, so it looks funny from the back."
4.0,It was fine. No issues.
4.0,"I'm really not sure what to feel about this belt. I really like it and thought it would last forever. Although, after nearly a year of using it, the stitching started to unravel. The good news is I contacted them for a solution and they responded very promptly and sent me a new buckle. They even included a free wallet, which looks very nice  and also well made! It would've been more than what I hoped for but unfortunately the replacement buckle that they sent was a different style than the original one. I really like don't like the style of the replacement one, which is why I'm a bit disappointed. Hopefully the problem with the stitching that I experienced is a fluke, because the style and the look of the belt looks really nice."
4.0,I just think that with having the port where the lights actually work and you‚Äôre breathing it hampers on the ability to breathe in properly just have to re-design it better
4.0,"Cutest pajama set. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top barely covers my boobs, hits right below my boobs."
4.0,I loved the look of the top but ordered a size too large for me I could have actually gone down a size and it would fit better up top. So I would say stick with your normal size.
4.0,Hubby wears them for work.  He likes them a lot since he gets them wet frequently and they seem to be holding up well.
4.0,Love the pencil and other beads...hate the lanyard string. It is super thin string and much too short. Can't get it over my head.
4.0,"These pants are really soft and have a good medium thickness fabric and are made well.<br /><br />The pattern on the fabric looks really good, it's detailed and the colors are vibrant and the black is nice and dark. If you wash it in warm water like the tag says the colors stay pretty bright even after washing.<br /><br />The only downsides are:<br />-There is no drawstring on these (the pants are 36"" wide around before you start to use the stretch of the elastic band)<br />-The pockets are a little shallow, my partners whole hand didn't fit into them.<br />-You are suppose to let them hang dry"
4.0,Great fabric but I feel it's too thick for use as a swimsuit cover up.
4.0,"Great purse.  It fits all the basics.  I love that it can go from wristlet to crossbody.  I wish one of the pockets didn‚Äôt have the side holes because the skinny lip balms can fall out.  But the side pocket can hold several items, I have a full size lip gloss,  listerene breath strips, glasses cleaner, and a hair clip. The other pocket holds my iPhone X perfect.  If my pop socket is on my phone it‚Äôs a little tight but still snaps.  I‚Äôm getting used to the color, the red is on the orangey side.  But overall lightweight and functional."
4.0,I thought the item was a tank top. It turned out to be a sports bra.
4.0,I like the rhinestone detail but not the band.
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Very cute.
4.0,"It wasn't what I expected, but I will accept that as my fault. I bought it as a long-sleeved tee-shirt. I realize that nowhere did it say that. This was a Christmas present to myself. Christmas was a little stressy here, 8-year-old, 6-month infant, lots of stuff going on.<br /><br />However, on the bright side, it is warm, it does fit, it is well made and has survived two washing machine cleanings in perfect shape, so far. In other words, the words have not washed away and it looks brand new! It is also comfortable. Would I buy it again? Absolutely!"
4.0,"High Quality Band for a terrific price.<br /><br />Metal is a bit shiny for my taste but I m sure it was tarnish nicely.<br /><br />Overall great product, very comfortable and very easy to adjust."
4.0,Fits exactly as I expected it too. Is super comfortable. It is a bit see through so no neon bras if your not wearing something over it. Really love this piece.
4.0,"Arrived on time, only gave 4 stars because belt is already showing signs of wear so not the best quality."
4.0,the guitar picks are really good quality and the strap is a bit uncomfy but does work
4.0,"Nice fit, nice length... denim material is a bit lightweight, but perfect for summer."
4.0,"Cute coat, looks exactly as pictured. I ordered it for my daughter who might normally wear a large, but we ordered the XL based on other reviews and it's a good thing. It fits perfectly."
4.0,Product looks great and offer great eyes protection. They are bigger then in pictures and maybe it will be a good idea to show them on somebody face.
4.0,"Cute simple dress, not a sweater as states in desciption..waffle like material."
4.0,cute but too small for my 5 1/2 month old. will regift to a newborn
4.0,"It‚Äôs a tad shorter than I expected but that‚Äôs ok. Just thought it was worth mentioning, otherwise fits fine and is very soft and comfortable"
4.0,Cool design but I wish what you write on the shirt would last longer.
4.0,"Love them, they are really great! Although they are different sizes. Some are larger than others. But its alright. I still enjoy wearing them. Got lots of compliments on them. Even my mom wanted some for christmas. All around worth it!"
4.0,Pretty dress! Fairly casual though
4.0,"Wore these for a hiking trip to Havasupai. Went there the day after the massive Arizona snow storm in Feb 2019. It was COLD (20‚Äôs) at night and prob 40‚Äôs during the day. With a light base layer, these pants were PERFECT for me. I wasn‚Äôt too hot. They were comfortable and roomy for walking, hiking and climbing. Opportunity to improve the zippers though. I kinda struggled w them. But really, for $40 these are an amazing deal and I can manage my zipper issues. :)"
4.0,cute dress...comfy and can be dressed up or down. it is baggy but in a good way.
4.0,I like it But I tough it was coming with the bottom like the picture show it!.
4.0,Nice sun protection.  Compact and lightweight---
4.0,Great lightweight jacket that is stylish and useful. Very happy with purchase.
4.0,"I like them I just wish they were thinner. But they are comfortable, I even throw mine in the washer!."
4.0,"The Newffr casual blazer is perfect for the office. It is a beautiful color, caramel/camel. Traditional style - one button, with pockets. It is lightweight and comfortable. It fits true to size, no need to order up. The fabric is a blend of polyester and spandex. This blazer can be worn with every and anything ‚Äì from pants to jeans. I‚Äôd recommend it."
4.0,"it came with a few stones detached in the bag and the links were broken open. But I liked it enough to glue them back and repaired the links. It looks great , it  makes any plain dress interesting!"
4.0,"I love love these, but had to knock off stars because after 3 months of alternating wearing 5 of these in different colors every night and washing them (gently mind you) they're starting to fall apart. :(. Too bad because they‚Äôre so soft and perfect for nursing. I loved having them at the hospital after c section."
4.0,"I‚Äôm usually small in pants, I bought the medium size to be a little lose but it wasn‚Äôt. Besides that i love them."
4.0,Light weight I think my grandson will like it.
4.0,I think the watch was perfect for the older gentleman it was purchased for. No complaints
4.0,So nice but only one gripe. It needs padding in the chest. Other than that it rocked.
4.0,"Cute, shiny. They don‚Äôt look super cheap. They don‚Äôt stain my ears green, although they are a bit irritating to wear."
4.0,"My 6 year old son is very hard on shoes.  He rides bikes, drags his feet and runs around ---- all day.  With that, we have a very high standard for shoes for boys.  These shoes work, but they didn't quite meet his rough and rowdy standard.  He beat these shoes up, and although he still wears them and it's been just a month, they won't last.  I give them 3 months max, and not even non-stop wear.  The toe is not reinforced, which is a big problem for a young boy.  They are extremely lightweight so easy to run in and the velcro is a necessity at his age so he can quickly get in and out of shoes on his own.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't purchase this shoe again, and won't for my youngest boy.  I will look for soemthing more durable.  However, I will keep these until he wears them out completely."
4.0,"I was surprised that this fit and looked pretty much just like it does in the pictures online. I'm 130#, 28e bust and about a size 2-4 and ordered the small. It's not fitted, but the soft, drapey fabric clings and hangs in the right places and it looks comfortable but not sloppy. The buttons look a little cheap and could be sewn on better. I love the magenta color and the soft knit material a lot. The scrunchy drapey button neckline is also fun and I might replace the &#34;silver&#34; buttons to some I like better so I get even more enjoyment out of it.<br />One tip - the fabric is thin (but not see through) so be sure to wear a seamless bra under it if you care about that kind of thing."
4.0,"It is big, very big, but beautiful. I get many compliments on the color more than the bag itself. One of the rhinestone accent pieces fell out but it's not noticeable, and I could care less if they all fall out since I dislike rhinestones. But they are towards the bottom of the purse anyways!"
4.0,Fabric is soft and I went up one size<br />M to L fit is great
4.0,"These are a great value, but keep these in a sturdy case or else the screws get loose and the frames will be off center. Looks very badass though."
4.0,"Best hat I've ever owned, other than it fades from sweat and sun very fast!"
4.0,Good enough breeches that I will use them only for shows.
4.0,"These shoes were very cute for my daughter. They were perfect for the daddy daughter dance and went with everything. The only part that was disappointing was pulling them out of the bag they came in and several stones came off. They fell off easily but couldn't tell any ""bald"" areas. Got for a decent price though."
4.0,the glasses are very well constructed but are only for someone with a medium to large head.  they start out kind of loose and become even more so as they are worn. don't advise for people with head size on the smaller end.
4.0,Very thin . Not sure how they will hold up..
4.0,"look okay, feel okay, great price"
4.0,Love the shirt. Arms are long for me but then again I‚Äôm short so it‚Äôs to be expected.
4.0,"I was hoping the setting would be a bit thicker than it was. (Thicker prongs, bigger basket) There are no other pictures so you can't tell."
4.0,I bought this necklace for my granddaughter and she liked it. The price was right for a little extra Christmas gift.
4.0,very fashionable and ive worn it many times already. very cheap but not cheaply made. very light on the neck.
4.0,"Average fit. Soft. A bit cheap though, I don‚Äôt expect it to last long."
4.0,I love this dress. The pattern is super cute and it has pockets!! The biggest issue is that the chest is weirdly large. But other than that its great!
4.0,VERY cute socks!!! Wish they were a little loser and thicker. They'll probably wear out quickly.
4.0,A little more snug than expected so it went back.
4.0,"First let me start by saying that I am extremely picky when it comes to purses. This purse sure does have a lot of &#34;bling&#34; but not enough to be considered gaudy in my definition. It is extremely spacious with plenty of pockets. I love the zipper closure and the zipper on the outside works perfect for my cell phone. It is a little bit bigger in the length (from handle to the bottom of the purse) than I expected, but once I added all of my items into the purse it made the con-caving effect that you see in the picture, otherwise it was just flat across the top where the zipper is. My only reason for not giving this purse 5 stars is that I am a little concerned about how the decorations will hold up over a period of time, I am hoping that they will not fall off easily because I really do like this purse."
4.0,"Great details, just not sure about the durability"
4.0,Have other pairs
4.0,should order a bigger size
4.0,"Nice pattern, loose fitting to make breathing easier"
4.0,"My Blank Male Mask Plain White arrived broken.  Unuseable for me is a bad thing.  I had plans to make this into my own design for Mardi Gras celebration.  Shipping and packaging was the culprit and it cost this item a star.  It would have been a fragile mask, that would break as this one did.,"
4.0,"Love it! The chain it came with was kind of short and cheap looking,  so I changed to another chain,  but the locket is exactly what I was hoping for."
4.0,Absolutely love the rings. They're everything i expected. Great price for what i purchased. Thank you.
4.0,I've never owned compression socks before so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br />I bought the bigger size as I'm a female size 11 shoe and thick calves. A little struggle to put on of course but once they were on they stayed on and we're actually comfortable under my leggings. Had them on all day and my legs felt better at night time.<br />  My family has a history of varicose veins and poor circulation so I'm hoping to help with that before I develop any problems.
4.0,my son prefers these shoes for everyday work use.
4.0,"These earrings were much bigger than I expected.  Even though they are large, they are lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The colors are very pretty and the overall design is nice.  My only complaint was that they looked kind of cheap and the painting looked a bit sloppy, but you'd have to look closely to really notice that.  I can't imagine that anyone would notice while you're wearing them."
4.0,Got a large size then ordered doesn't fit wrist
4.0,"I like the look and fit of the bangle, however, it is a little tricky to get off.  I'm hopeful it will be easier the longer it is worn."
4.0,These are pretty much exactly what I'd expect with leggings cut to the knee. They tailor right against the knee and are as pictured. For some reason the blue fits better than the black and I do wish they fit the same or the black was the better fitting of the duo but whaddya gonna do. It is what it is. The blue are perfecto! I split the difference and said they fit somewhat small as the black ones do. I'm keeping them.
4.0,"Pros: I liked both the design and the fabric. The design is pretty unusual - I mean the top. I had never got such before and it was interesting to have such in my closet. I must say I looked rather pretty and I had got tons of compliments wearing this dress. The fabric is stretchy enough with no show through. The color is amazing. I had chosen the bright red one. It is much nicer than the given picture in the good's description. Cons: the top of the dress is too big (even I bought the S size it is a little bit large for me). Watch the pictures, please. I am afraid to move‚Äã because it feels like the top will fall off my both shoulders."
4.0,I like these but they are tight on my hands. Im a average size guy and if I had any bigger hangs these would not fit.
4.0,As advertised and comes with a couple of differant sized pins
4.0,Muy bonito ....recomendado.
4.0,Really cute!  Looks exactly as advertised.  Much smaller in person than I expected - especially for the price.
4.0,"Very cute! I was so nervous about ordering straight from China because quality and size are usually an issue but this time was a score! I will be saving this for the boardwalk as its perfect for vacation. Very comfy too.  I lucked out on this one. I'm almost 5'6"" and I'm 128 lbs and the size (MEDIUM) is spot on.  Id like it to be a bit shorter but oh well, I'm still happy.  I took a pic but it doesn't do justice.. (Took 5 weeks to arrive from China, fyi)"
4.0,"Liked the checkbook cover, looking forward to using"
4.0,My son loves but a little snugger for a 3t than I‚Äôd like. Wish I would have sizes up
4.0,"The colors are vibrant but the transition doesn't sit right on my torso. The top is a stretchy material so if I pull the skirt down to sit at my waist, it always rides back up under my boobs making me look pregnant or akward shaped. The navy color is not sheer, and you can't see through the skirt either. I wish it fit me better it's so pretty."
4.0,"Pretty booties, nice grey suede, just didn‚Äôt fit my feet, had to send back"
4.0,"Overall a nice watch. The quality is nice and appearance is good! But I ordered a blue watch (22blue) after I received my watch and inspected it, it seems the color is darker than I ordered. I like the watch, just disappointed in the color."
4.0,girl like it to work out
4.0,"Exactly what I was expecting, I got the grey andnhad<br />No trouble with colorn transferring. The inner pocket was more of a nuisance than I anticipated, but otherwise it is a fine bag."
4.0,"Unusual odor, but attractive, great fit, fine for jogging -- what a bargain! Yes, you get all three bras. I am a 34 D, and the Medium is a perfect fit -- slides on well, is comfortable and secure, and the thick pad included makes my breast look higher and fills out any extra space in the cup. Material is thick and comfy, but not hot. My only concern, especially since this is made in China, is the chemical odor. One washing decreased the odor, but did not eliminate it."
4.0,"They are a little long, but, nice quality, I like them."
4.0,I have a bracelet that is impossible to put on without help. This tool helps me do it. Useful tool to have in your jewelry box.
4.0,"Cute at good price.  The size is perfect.  Not too big, not to small."
4.0,These socks are comfortable and supportive. I do like the material and is holding up well.
4.0,"Great for the money!  These are an awesome value. I purchased them for no-gi jiu jitsu because I was not willing to pay $50 plus for compression tights and $50 for a shirt from a name brand company, only to have them pulled, stretched, and roughed up on the mats.  These have held up really well to all the abuse they've received.  They run a tad small in my opinion because they are geared to smaller Asian/European body types.  I'm 6' 1&#34; and 200 lbs with a 36&#34; waist and needed to order the XL set,  which fits me well.  The material is a bit thin (i.e. don't wear them without underwear unless you're looking for attention or laughs, ha!),  but they have held up to nearly a year of rough use during jiu jitsu with no holes or tears.  A few threads have come loose at the wrists and collar of the shirt,  but I have simply trimmed them from time to time and nothing has unraveled yet. I wear them three nights week for two hours of intense buy jitsu and wash them right after.  I'm definitely going to buy another set because this deal is too good to pass up IMHO!"
4.0,"This isn‚Äôt really the cutest when it‚Äôs on, but it doesn‚Äôt hug your mid section and that‚Äôs what I like about it. Works well under an apron."
4.0,"I've been using American Tourister brand luggage for 10 years.<br /> I travel quite a bit,  and the luggage holds up pretty well.<br /><br /> What I don't like about the set, is the included duffel bag has wheels, but no handle. I do not understand the reasoning behind this design. It makes no sense.  Also, the plastic plating that makes up the interior construction is relatively weak, and brakes pretty easily upon impact.  It doesn't appear to affect the functionality of the suitcase, but it's pretty annoying to have to clean out shards of broken plastic out of the bottom of your suitcase after a trip.<br /> If you're planning on buying this set,I would highly recommend purchasing a set without the duffle.  Unless of course, you enjoy lugging a duffel bag around the airport.<br /><br /> Overall, American Tourister is a  good brand, and their products are decent. The suitcases look good, and will certainly hold up for a while."
4.0,"Great jeans for my son, but I ordered one size too big. Had to return instead of exchange because there were only a few sizes to choose from. Other than the few size options, these were fine jeans."
4.0,"I have very light sensitive eyes.  I have to pull down my mask to eliminate any light through the mask.  Otherwise, the mask is good."
4.0,... shoulder straps are narrow and tend to twist when putting this on. Well designed and love all the compartments.
4.0,"Simple review. They fit, they are comfortable, but I think they are perhaps just a tad bit short on construction and quality when compared to other brand name underwear I own. I have not had any issues, but this is my impression so far. If they fall apart after a few washings I will return here and make a note of it. If they wear quite well and live a long life, I will return and update accordingly."
4.0,"Good quality fabric, and good fit besides the length. I am 5‚Äô9 and expected it to be quite long after reading other reviews, but found it fell about 3 inches too short."
4.0,Got this for part of my grandson's costume for Halloween. The hat has a very sturdy construction.
4.0,Material is soft.
4.0,Beautiful colored stone. Nice deep color. Nice design & size
4.0,Love Gaiam sport bras as they are always thick and cute.  But this one is way too tight and not stretch enough at the underband compared to the other Gaiam bra styles. Should order one size up.
4.0,The hat fists great and the same as pictured.
4.0,"I really wish this sweatshirt had been true to size. It was better quality than I expected, but it is a size or two too small."
4.0,Bottom fit perfectly but the top was little too small
4.0,Had mines for little over a month and I love it. I love. Fine size chain it's not thin. Solid elephant bfor size it's very noticable and I get many compliments.
4.0,"These are 5 star leather gloves, but not 5 star texting gloves...<br />These are beautiful, great feeling gloves, but I wouldn't want to use my phone seriously, or for extended periods of time with these on...<br /><br />These are packaged beautifully in a high quality box, and have the smell and feel of the highest quality leather, they are super soft!<br />If they weren't billed as texting gloves, I would absolutely give them 5 stars! They are the highest quality leather gloves I've ever had... it's just that for texting and controlling the screen of my Android phone...it's a bit hit or miss.  Interestingly, the thumb tips seem to work better than the other finger tips.  Also, using more of the back edge of the finger tips, seems to be a bit more reliable than the front edge.<br /><br />It's too bad they aren't a bit more consistent with their touch...but they are such awesome gloves, and the texting feature wasn't what I cared most about, so am just removing 1 star.<br /><br />PRO's-<br />*Awesome Highest quality leather<br />*The genuine leather smell, is that of the best premium leather<br />*Very nice, soft wool inner lining<br />*Gloves are quite thin, yet surprisingly warm<br />*They look and feel great!<br /><br />CON's-<br />*Not totally reliable for touch screen control, often taking multiple contacts/swipes to register.<br />*Trade-off to being so thin, is that they wouldn't be the best for the coldest of temps.<br /><br />I purchased these at a discount in exchange for my promise to provide my honest and impartial review, which I promise I am giving here.  (If you look at my reviews, you will see this doesn't keep me from giving 1 or 2 star reviews or praise as warranted.)<br />Let me know if you have any questions."
4.0,"The girl likes the jumpsuit. She normally wears a medium but the large fits her better. This is tight in the chest, so follow the sizing guidelines carefully. Also follow the washing instructions."
4.0,Pretty cheaply made but it sufficed. Only worn once
4.0,"These are comfortable and I love the small pocket that they have. However, they are quite transparent. The material is nice and I love wearing them for a run. Just make sure you have a shirt long enough to cover your rear if you don't want people to know what color underwear you have on!"
4.0,Very comfortable and looks cute on me!
4.0,"The magnetic clasp was the selling point for me. It is very secure, and the fact that there are three colors, which all are very nice to wear with coordinating dresses, was an added bonus. The face covers are great as well."
4.0,The bands really fit on my husband's gear s2. But the color doesn't match the photo. It's kinda blue green. But he still likes itüòä
4.0,was for my dougther..and she love it!
4.0,Cute & Comfy Top!  Hope that the burgundy color doesn't fade or bleed into the white sleeves....keep your fingers crossed!
4.0,Runs small. Order size up.
4.0,Runs just slightly smaller than expected maybe order a size larger than you need but otherwise a great buy
4.0,"Was a little disappointed by quality, can tell the leather is cheaply died, and has a strange feel and smell because of that. The plate with writing also appears slightly miscolored, but liked it enough to keep it."
4.0,"This bra arrived in only a week and a half while Amazon said it would take 4 weeks to get here. I ordered an XL and the strap around the ribcage was TOO small. Fortunately I have some sewing skills and I added an extra 5 inches of lace fabric to the strap so I could actually wear it. It is really comfortable and very sexy. It does offer me nipple protection which I was kind of skeptical of but It hides them! No underwire but the straps do get to hold the girls comfortably! I thought  this was definitely a steal even though I had to add a little bit of extra fabric, but I will definitely buy another one since it is the most sexiest bra top I own! For my plus size gals and big chested girls, I do NOT recommend  this since the girls will fall out or the ribcage strap will not be able to clasp."
4.0,"Ever since my husband retired, his wardrobe has become more and more casual and a little worn. I've been buying him some new pieces that are just a little more dressy for visiting friends, going out to eat, attending local concerts, etc.  This Paul Jones sweater looked like it would fit the bill, and it did. My husband loved the color and pattern, and said it fit him perfectly. I thought it was a little big for him but it's probably just as well because he likes to wear layers. Also, he has relatively long arms and the sleeves were long enough. A smaller size wouldn't have worked for him.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the shoulder seams. The shoulders are a solid color (black) but in some places the white threads underneath show through at the seams. I may reinforce them by hand to make sure they don't open up the first time there is any stress on them. Other than that, the workmanship was pretty good for the price point.<br /><br />I would call this a medium-weight sweater, maybe on the heavy side of medium. Either way, I'm sure it will add warmth on a cold day and look good doing it."
4.0,"Probably won't order again, but they will do for now.  I ordered it for swimsuit but it has more of a workout/runner's feel to me."
4.0,"This suit is really cute. The color is true red.  Love the pattern and under shorts.  Unfortunately it's very small. I ordered up, as I usually do, but it's still tight.  Order up 2 sizes if you want this suit.  The bodice is tight, there's no way to cinch the keyhole in the top any tighter/closer,  and the skirt, although pretty, hugs the rolls making this a no go for me.<br /><br />There's no hem,  the edge is rough cut and the pattern is one sided and does not go clear through thre fabric.  The under side is white. The boy shorts are great,  if only they fit. The pads in the bra are removable, but there's ZERO support.<br /><br />Not the best for larger busted women.  Wish it came larger, I'm a 14 and the XXL is too small/tight."
4.0,Ordered 2x it's actually xl which worked out perfectly
4.0,"The dress is a nice, thick &#34;scuba&#34; fabric and seems high quality. However, I'm very tall (5'10) and curvy.. this is definitely way too short for me and I feel it doesn't compliment my body type. Could definitely work for the right person, unfortunately it's not for me. Wish this fabric came in a wrap type dress!"
4.0,"Looks just like the image and the material is super soft. However, I ordered a medium thinking the small wouldn't have fit and it's actually too big. Just stick to your regular size."
4.0,"Like but haven't worn yet, because the weather here is to warm. Wish it was wash and wear (in and out of washer and dryer)."
4.0,This is an amazing dress!! I got so many compliments. I went a size bigger than I usually get and it had plenty of room. I got soooooo many compliments. The only issue was that the sequins would catch on each other between my arms and sides.
4.0,"Shiny, pretty and the engraving is well done. The chain is thicker, giving it a cheaper appearance. But, I bought these for my teenager and for the price and quality they are perfect. She has options, and loves the personal touch."
4.0,Shoe was a little bigger than expected but it fits okay.  I am satisfied with my purchase.  I am looking to purchase another one of different colours but with a 0.5 smaller size.
4.0,"I bought this watch for my Hubby for Valentines Day, it is a beautiful watch and I thought it would make an excellent dress watch. Arrived in a timely manner. The watch is gorgeous, it has a the look of a much more expensive piece. My Hubby did love the watch.<br />But on the down side it came with no instructions and it has a  very difficult clasp. Needless to say it took the both of us fiddling with it for almost an hour. Before I finally figured out the secret and yes it seems like a secret, to working the clasp. Once you figure it out and put all the pieces into play at the same time. You can finally wear the watch. Why in heavens name they made a clasp that difficult, I do not know. But if you are thinking of buying this watch for an elderly gentleman, don't. There will be no way he can put the watch on by himself.<br />Other than that, the watch is very beautiful, not needing a battery is a big plus, it has dials for the day and month, also for military time.  Well worth the price."
4.0,"Because of the cut, consider sizing up if you are busty. The style is on trend, and the dress is fully lined, which makes it a GEM in a world of see-through clothing. The dress is a hair short, but that comment is probably because of my age and not necessarily the dress itself."
4.0,"These are as pictured, great little pins, didn't appear to be cheap. I was happy that they came in a nice box to display them."
4.0,"I'm normally a size 10, or sometimes an 8. I usually wear a medium for items like this. So I bought a medium (I thought), and it fit but I thought I wanted a little more room for something I was going to work out in. So I ordered a large. They were better, and when I held them up next to each other the waist seemed about the same but I'd say there was an additional 3"" or so in the hips. Perfect. When I went to package up the first pair and couldn't find the bag marked medium, that's the first I realized they were both large. They're made in China, where ""large"" has a whole different meaning than in the US. That's fine - when I notice something is made in China I generally go up in size. (As an 8/10 I have actually required an XXL in one item!) But at least they should be consistent. Once I found a large that fit, I will say they are comfortable and I like the fact that they have pockets because my nose runs when I work out and I never have any place for a tissue. I do now! BTW, the return process was quite simple, and free."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for a child. Soft material, nice coloring. Child liked it, but seemed to fit a little snug so likely won't be worn for too long. But as trends go, she may not want to wear it for too long so I'm not too concerned about it. The child was happy to recieve it and wear it, which made me satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"This is the exactly what it says on the tin. They are just slightly oversized, dark shades that stand firmly on your nose, thanks to a wide frame.<br />They are sturdy, and you feel that it is not top class material. But not cheapest either. And not possible to notice at a glance at all.<br />All in all, very happy with the purchase, and highly recommend these shades. Having a feeling ZZ TOP was talking about these when singing about cheap sunglasses.<br />For this price I think you wont get anything better. Great stuff."
4.0,Fit well and looks great on. I am very satisfied
4.0,"Since I'm very photosensitive I've been searching for a wide-brimmed sun hat with a flexible brim for awhile. But previously, I haven't been able to find any that weren't straw (and therefore prone to being crushed easily).<br /><br />So my mother found the Solar Escape Grasslands hat, which managed to fulfill all my requirements. It isn't actually made of straw, but a synthetic/paper mixture that feels and looks a lot like straw. This causes the entire hat to be very flexible -- you can squish it, twist it, flatten it, fold it, and it will be easily restored to its original shape. It fit my head snugly (I have an average-sized head), and it breathes well so that you won't end up sweating under it.<br /><br />Furthermore, the brim has a sort of wire inside that keeps it circular, but is flexible enough that I can pull the brim down over my eyes without it springing back. All in all, an excellent sunhat for anyone worried that their brim isn't wide enough, or that their hat might have to be packed or subjected to some abuse."
4.0,Pretty good beach or grocery bag.
4.0,"I purchased this for my son, a big Doctor Who fan. He loves it. It is a nice, stretchy knit and has held up well to a 10-year-old's treatment."
4.0,"Could have slightly better quality, but it's great otherwise !!"
4.0,"These shorts are super cute but entirely see through. They fit perfectly well, although i'm worried they will shrink in the wash."
4.0,"Although I liked that it was shaped like a graduation cap, I was surprised that it was so small."
4.0,"Nice wallet - lots of pockets for envelope system or coupons or receipts, etc. I thought the outside was more leather-y, but it's soft. Not a big deal, just something I wasn't expecting. It's obviously not a super high quality product, but it's great."
4.0,I got a large prob could have got a medium but was worried about length. It‚Äôs not sheer as far as I can tell so far. Gotta take in the waist but length is better this way I have a bigger bust anyway.
4.0,This is a nice set.. not cheaply made... I'm satisfied.
4.0,"They're bigger than expected, but I like them. They catch the eye."
4.0,Dress size 4. Fit is true to size. The only problem is the beading falls off easily which is why I gave it a 4/5. Otherwise the dress is beautiful and my 15 year old loves it! She is wearing it to homecoming.
4.0,These cleats are extremely cute! The colors are pretty and they fit my daughter well. I'd advise parents to go up a 1/2 size to make sure there is room for the shin guards.
4.0,Very cozy. Comfortable and medium weight. Nice for the between weather seasons.
4.0,The fit is great but the bottom of the pants doesn‚Äôt have stitching
4.0,Unusual mix of metal & colored wrap; Super love this combo.  One of my favorite bracelets.  Forgot and wore it in the shower ONCE and now some of the brass has rubbed through on the anchor.  RATS!  Still love it though!
4.0,"This is a pretty necklace. The chain is on the thin, dainty side, which I like. The bar isn't big, by any means, but it's big enough to add a touch of beauty to an outfit. It's filled with clear stones, so it sparkles when the light hits it. It's obvious the quality isn't super fancy, but it's still nice and has an elegant look to it."
4.0,Glasses look and feel great. The only bad thing is that caring case looks bigger than  it would probably needs to be and kind of flimsy.
4.0,Not sure if this is the real thing
4.0,Ordered my normal Steve Madden size and it fit as expected. Woven toe box is real leather but heel is faux. Not a stock white... just a smidge creamy in color. Added a foot petal to give it some cushion as I have a hight arch and instep. Wearable all day.
4.0,"Pros: decent quality fabric, cute design, great color scheme, fits very well, molded cups are a plus!<br />Cons: runs small. I wear a medium, size 6 pants and S-m tops US, ordered a large based on reviews and the bottoms fit, but the top is a little small, probably could get away with the XL for a more flattering look overall.<br /><br />I like this. And it's worth the price and is stitched very well and looks good!"
4.0,"Pretty cool hat, very bright led. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has a battery pack on the side of the hat. Not cool, but I'm using it for a work hat, so I can manage. Gray hat overall though"
4.0,"This is basically a tunic with a little embellishment (the buttons on the v-neck and the 3/4 sleeves) that's mostly soft (poly-spandex blend). I like the oatmeal color, it's a nice neutral, and it's a bit thicker than most tunics so it provides more coverage, but not much else to say about it. The top could do for more casual work environments and with jeans or leggings, and for a large, it doesn't seem too 'big'. Might want to size up."
4.0,"I'm not going to lie; if you are bigger than a size 12 USA woman (size 13 Junior), don't buy. That being said, they fit like a second skin. They have a piece of plastic at crack seem to allegedly lift & separate your buttocks. I like them. I receive many compliments in them. My BF loves them on me!"
4.0,"i recommond bigger size, but the shoe is so cute"
4.0,"Exactly what was ordered, good condition and great price. Inexpensive watch that can handle abuse."
4.0,Will work Great with the other Snake Jewerly Items I got‚Äîto With my Wrap-Around Snake Dress‚ÄîPrice was Right
4.0,"This is a really nice dress. It seems a little thin, but isn't see through and is great for spring.summer.  I wanted something that could be a little of a &#34;go to&#34; dress for when i don't know what to wear. The dress seems well made, no loose threads or out of place buttons. The belt is removable which I like.  I am 5'4&#34; and 105 lbs, 30 inch chest.  I bought a size small and it falls just below the knee for me.  The chest is a little roomier than I wish, but I was expecting that based on the measurements."
4.0,This item has a great loose fit. Very cute and comfortable!
4.0,"So cute! The top fit perfect but the skirt was big, no big deal I will just pin the side.<br />5'2 120 ordered size small"
4.0,Will need a strapless bra. Looks nice. I am short so it fit long enough. It came to the top of my hips. I read it ran short. On me it was a good fit. Very comfortable shirt.
4.0,"I like the watch, but its a little to small from my wrist. I was hoping that the watch would have come with some extra knobs, but I was wrong. now I'm looking for knobs for the watch. Anyone know where I can find some?"
4.0,"I loved the dial but the strap color is not exactly as shown in the pic,it‚Äôs too dull.I have to replace it with a brighter strap to make it look perfect."
4.0,Nice size for a smaller purse. Excellent quality.
4.0,"I like Hanging Caddy, but it will not glide completely across the bath rod."
4.0,nice coat but order a larger size than usual
4.0,Loved items and received in timely manner.
4.0,"I like it. Nice color too. High impact support is what I was looking for for support for the girls when running. It IS a little tight but I know I will be losing some weight with the increased jogging I will be doing. It‚Äòs right there for now. And definite support.<br />I am 5.3 and weigh 131lbs, wear 34C if that helps. I Ordered a Large.<br />I normally wear a medium (sometimes a small large). I ordered up due to descriptions. Happy."
4.0,"I really like the color of the wallet, but it only holds about 6 cards and I was expecting a lot more space when it was ordered.  I'm sure it'll work out and maybe it'll stop me for signing up for every rewards card out there..."
4.0,"Bought 2 designs in XL which is my normal size. I like that the dress is super light and flowy, however its super see through and I would recommend wearing black shorts underneath.<br />I dont really have boobs and its tight in my chest. The one dress came and it felt almost damp?"
4.0,"To be honest, I was very disappointed when I opened the package to see how DULL the color the legging is. For such an exciting name like &#34;Mango Flame&#34;, I was anticipating a brighter, more vibrant hue . I even had my heart set on returning it without trying it on. But a little voice inside my head told me to just give it a try. Once on, it looks much better ! I don't know if it's because my body stretched out the material and that made the color look better ? All in all, I will keep it. Just be aware that it's not orange like expected (thanks to the creative naming of the legging), but more of a coral pink. I included what the stock photo of the legging look like, and you can see a considerable contrast between the picture on the site and what actually was delievered to me. For reference, I am 5'6 120-125 lbs with an athletic build, &#34;XS&#34; fit me perfectly. I used to make the mistake of ordering &#34;S&#34; with leggings from this company , but the leggings never fit right in the waistline. Leggings are best when fitted a BIT tight for compression which helps with blood circulation during exercising. One last thing to note! Legging is slightly see-through. I normally wear a thong underneath my workout leggings, so as to avoid any visible panty line. However, I tried on the legging to take a picture quickly and was wearing my black &#34;cheekster&#34; panty and there was a visible panty outline (as well as the black color permeating through the coral fabric). Just be careful, ladies,"
4.0,The color was off but still a cute. After a few washes one of the buttons came off. Did the job though so I can't complain.
4.0,I would recommend these for anyone with a large waste and long legs. The tagless band is very comfortable .
4.0,"I ordered these in a size (or two) too small - so its totally my fault. I havent been able to wear them yet and probably wont be able to since I cant fit them over my thighs/butt (sorry guys, cant post a picture of this one). However, had I gotten the right size, Im sure they wouldve looked great! They are super thin/breathable and the khaki color is the perfect shade. Too bad Im one of those lazy people who will print out the return label but knows deep down that these pants wont be going anywhere besides the back of my bottom drawer.<br /><br />Order up in size...just in case."
4.0,nice and cozy good for lounge wear or good to wear with jeans
4.0,"Very pretty shirt and my daughter absolutely loved it! Not made of cotton so I know color will not fade but it will also be really hot in the Vegas sun once summer comes. My daughter turned 10 and is a little on the plump side, I ordered two shirts since I wasn't sure if they were going to come smaller in size, to my surprise they came way bigger than I expected! The one my daughter is wearing is a 9-12 & it fit her big, but comfortable.  She was very happy with her Among Us Party and matching shirt. I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"Looks cute, one complaint, it's super hard to use the restroom because it's a back zipper and it's short in the crotch."
4.0,It is cute and as pictured and described except that it runs very small. I measured my wrist and picked the larger size to allow for it to be a little loose based on the description however it is VERY tight. Uncomfortable unless you like it tight on your wrist. I do not. i would have rated it higher if it fit better. not sure if i am going to keep or send back. Good quality.
4.0,"I really like my key chain. It is smaller in person, but still like the look!"
4.0,"Very cute, well made, top was big, bottoms ran a lil small, besides that it's great!"
4.0,"Soft and luxurious feeling, its very silky in texture.  The color is more of a light silver tone which pairs nicely with different tops.  I deducted one star because the seams around the fringe look like they're coming undone. I gently tugged on them and they stayed put but I worry how it will hold up in a washing (btw: hand wash only). I also do not care for the unfinished look of the edges.  But the color and softness of the scarf far outweigh the edging. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review."
4.0,Was a little baggy at first - fit better after wash and dry
4.0,"It's very important to read the product info which warns one must view their size chart and not Amazon's. I did that and it is still too small. I marked &#34;fits as expected&#34; because I was warned, but only gave 4 stars for this reason. Otherwise I like the turtleneck and the soft, stretchy material."
4.0,I like the long cardigan only draw back no pockets I knew that going in wish it still had them.
4.0,Cute. Fits my 3 yr. old perfectly. I deducted a star since they had what looked like sugar on them. I‚Äôm guessing someone had purchased them and returned them. Had to wash them before letting her wear them.
4.0,they ended being too small in the calf but I have used them and they are excellent
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable - a little thin, but great in the spring time. It can be worn at work or going out with friends."
4.0,Good quality! Just thinking they are definitely made for men legs. I'm a woman 5.6&#34; 128 pounds and it doesn't pressure enough
4.0,"While the description says ‚Äúyellow‚Äù you‚Äôll be surprised by it being orange. They need to say this is orange, NOT yellow. It‚Äôs comfy with the memory foam and sturdy. I wear a size 6 and bought the 6-6.5 but it‚Äôs too small. I mean I guess it fits if you squeeze your toes all the way up, you can say it fits but no. So go a size up, definitely go a size up if you plan to wear socks with it too. Apparently I won‚Äôt be able to or my feet will most likely fall out. Other than that, everything is fine. Plain and simple just like what I wanted."
4.0,"Dress did not fit me: far too tight, couldn't even put it on. Ended up giving it to my daughter."
4.0,These are HEAVY - be prepared.  I think they are gorgeous.  I took off one star because they are front heavy thus the front part of the clasp is always hanging visible in front.  These sparkle like diamonds and are truly stunning.
4.0,A bit thinner then I expected but since I do not have any nice thin wool socks these have worked quite fine in most instances.
4.0,"Great detailed item, just felt a little cheap. Overall great gift for the occasion"
4.0,They are exactly like the picture. However I wish I'd sized up because the 2mm is very subtle. Otherwise fantastic!
4.0,It's pretty but was actually sent over to me from CHINA.  It was a long wait to get it.  You do get what you pay for!!!
4.0,"They look so cute on the model but of course I don't have a model body anymore so they're not very flattering.  They're soft and comfortable but the material is very heavy!  I ordered my usual pant size and they're pretty large, I recommend going down at least one size.  They're also very long, I will need to hem them 3 or 4 inches!  I'm 5'3'' and I was walking all over the bottoms.  I don't think I can pull them off so I'm just going to use them as an around the house lounging pant (in the winter)."
4.0,"it definitly run a little small, is a very cute pair of tennis but have to order a half side up"
4.0,"Nice cardigan/ Duster fits a little big ,next Tim I'll order down a little."
4.0,"Good fit, though they run a bit big. The wrist does not tighten very well due to the lack of notches. Touch screen capability works perfectly."
4.0,"Top is really nice, I'm not a fan of the bottoms, however I bought the set just for the top anyway. Good hold and coverage for large chested women."
4.0,"works well, so far; only worn once. Feels like has good compression, similar to other more expensive compression socks I've used. Band at the top cuts into the calf just below the knee just a little bit. Not too uncomfortable to wear all day, but it is noticeable. As for the texture, they are a thinner (but not thin) sock that &#34;feels&#34; like synthetic fiber, as opposed to softer socks that feel like a traditional cotton-blend sock. Overall, it seems like a solid compression sock, especially for the price; a good value overall. The synthetic fibers feel like they should be durable; we'll see how the compression holds up over time. Overall, I do not regret this purchase at all."
4.0,"Absolutely perfect for Texas weather, not too thick. A bit longer than expected but super cute!"
4.0,I got these for my boyfriend and they fit him well. They are of a decent thickness and he loves them. I haven't noticed any loose threads and the quality is pretty good!
4.0,"These are nice tights with one huge exception... they are footless. So while my wife loves the thickness and loves the fit, they are not very practical for her. But if you are in the market for footless tights, these would certainly fit the bill as they are well made and comfortable."
4.0,Loved the material soft and fitting
4.0,"The inside strap broke as soon as I opened it up and undid it to see how it worked. Had barely even touched it. That being said, I probably never would have used it anyways so I just cut it out. I was worried about the size but it was exactly as I expected and it's super cute! I would buy it again!"
4.0,It's very pretty and it fits fine.  It's just a little smaller than I pictured.
4.0,"I liked that it look authentic. Downside is the Velcro stuck to my hair, but otherwise it was worth it"
4.0,"I normally wear a size 6, and I am large busted. I wear a small or medium depending on the brand. Based on reviews, I ordered the Large and it was too big. The medium fit much better out of the package but was a little long. However, this shirt shrunk considerably in the laundry (I only dry on low-heat). Now it‚Äôs a tiny bit shorter than I‚Äôd like but I‚Äôll just stretch it a smidge. The design is cute, and the placement of the coffee cups is just in the right place ;)."
4.0,"Feel very good because they are stretchy. Pockets are nice, deep and secure. Belt is practical. They are not for extreme cold, but I think are good year around."
4.0,"This dress is a great quality material. Exactly as pictured, minus the good boobs. The sleeves dont really like to sit on my arms, becuase they are a litte big, but it works well putting the sleeves on your shoulders as well. Overall, I would buy again!"
4.0,"I don't have anything to wear with it, just kidding but this was a present for my granddaughter and she loved it.  I bought it for her because she has two cats."
4.0,It was a bit small but still fit
4.0,"Good quality, a little larger than expected. A 25 by 25 would be perfect....."
4.0,"It looks just like the picture. However, its not as thick as I thought. Good coat."
4.0,Smaller then expected. Still nice necklace for child
4.0,THE CHARCOAL SEEM SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE BLUE VINTAGE WASH. COLOR IS A FADED VINTAGE LOOKING BLACK. GOES WELL WITH DARK GRAY BOOTS. THEY ARRIVE COMFORTABLE AS IF YOU'VE WASHED THEM A FEW TIMES ALREADY. MAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER MATCHING THE STRING TO THE PANT. GOTTA BE CAREFUL THAT IS TUCKED IN!  STRING IS A GREAT IDEA THO TO CUSTOMIZE THE WAIST. WOULD PREFER NO BACK POCKET STITCHING OR SAME COLOR STITCHING.
4.0,Product shipped quickly. Pants look great on. Only a slight drawback is that the pants are thinner than iI expected but they look great with almost anything.
4.0,"I loved the jacket, but it runs very small. If they had normal sizes, I would buy it again."
4.0,"Came with head band and towel dress, color doesn‚Äôt fade or bleed. Good soft cozy towel material. Not actually made of towel."
4.0,Its a nice little gift for a walking dead lover though the materials could be better
4.0,Cute. Nice purchase overall. A little big on me but nice material.
4.0,"This isn't a rip on the seller, who I have rated 4 stars, but on the construction of the hat. This particular hat seems to be a defect that was sold to me. If you look at the pics closely, you can see that the pattern lines do not line up evenly to the hat bill and that makes the hat slant off to one side (the left).<br />The quality seems to be good, though we shall see how it holds up. The fit is decent though a little tight (I got a medium) and it leaves a medium deep impression on my forehead.<br />Bottom line, I like the style and look of the hat and would buy another on the chance that maybe this purchase defect is a one-off."
4.0,"The only problem I had with this shirt sadly is that it didn't fit properly. I had assumed a 2x would fit, but it was not sized by US standards."
4.0,They were big.. My grandson have to save them
4.0,True to image color. (I got the orange)
4.0,Pretty comfortable masks. I like them
4.0,"Fitbit needs to buy this company and uses these bands as original equipment.  Their bands are basically uncomfortable and break so often they should be considered disposable.  The AVOD bands are infinitely adjustable, so you get a perfect fit, and will probably last much, much longer."
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it however runs a bit big. I tend to be between a small and medium in shirts. Ordered a medium and could have sized down. I am keeping it though, as I can knot it on the side and it looks super cute."
4.0,"I purchased this with very low expectations. It‚Äôs actually nice quality and fits well. I purchased the ‚Äúpeacock blue‚Äú with the scalloped bottoms. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, around 130, and typically wear S/M or 2/4, 32DDD. I purchased M) The bottoms come right up to my belly button but don‚Äôt quite cover it. The top runs fairly small but is stretchy enough and has completely adjustable straps so it works. A great value for the price."
4.0,"Material is a bit weird feeling. It's OK, nothing to write home about."
4.0,"I got these for my dad, who has been buying less-support Dr. Scholls socks at a chain store.  With the extra support in these socks, he can't get them on and will need a larger size."
4.0,"My dimensions are 35-28-38, and I ordered a SMALL based on reviews, which fit pretty well. It was perhaps a bit too tight around the middle, and fit fine elsewhere. I am returning it because the length of the sleeves and skirt didn't work for me. Seems like it would look better on a taller person (I'm 5'5&#34;, long torso, shorter legs). Be prepared to iron/steam this dress as the other reviews said."
4.0,"It looks just exactly how it looks on the picture. The fabric is cheap, how it's made is cheap also, and it doesn't feel good on the body.<br />I wear size m, and ordered m, it fits just perfectly. I'm 5'4 and have small breasts, that's true what reviews say, it wouldn't look as good with big ones.<br />I'm not amazed with it, but I like how it looks, so I'm keeping it."
4.0,"Quick shipping and exactly as described. Good quality for the price. However we felt the sizing ran one size small so if you wear a large, go up to an extra large."
4.0,"The material is very soft and warm. Perfect for a shorter person because you can curl up inside of it without having to take it off. Though this does make the pocket fall pretty low on the front, but my daughter is fine with that as it's not something is is planning on walking around with the pocket full anyway. Lots of color choices."
4.0,"They are very pretty, but they are heavy for the ears!!!"
4.0,This is a cute bag. It's nice and big and I like the &#34;brown&#34; color. The only problem is that it does smell a little. I think it's the glue in the handles because I smelled it when I took the plastic off the handles. I think it will air out quickly and be just fine.
4.0,"Thick. Warm. Fitted. Cute cropped top. Cute color options. Love it. Big bust so have to really stuff myself in there but for ave-sized ppl, fits great. Gives me the appearance of curves/ accentuates my curves."
4.0,"These earmuffs blocked sound very well.  I and my four year old grandson wore them during a very loud sporting event.  Loved the &#34;sporty white&#34; like a racing flag! However, ear nuff kept popping off when putting on or taking off and took a bit to click back into place."
4.0,"Really cute vest. It fits more like a Junior's medium vs a Women's medium, as I normally wear a small in Women's sizes and the medium was still a tad too small across the chest (and I'm a 36C, so nothing crazy). I wear it anyway unbuttoned with a skirt and t-shirt and get compliments on the outfit every time - it just makes an outfit look more thought out and deliberate. The material is a dark wash and is evenly distributed - no lighter or darker spots like you will see in some denim fabrics. My 4 star is due to the sizing being a little off."
4.0,The watch is nice but a lot smaller than expected.
4.0,I don't know if it runs (a little) small or if I can't admit my measurement has changed (back fat) lol but its sturdy and form fitting
4.0,Great shoes and price for my 6yo to use in gym class at school.
4.0,I'm not crazy about the nylon texture but they do fit great.
4.0,"Cute, fits a little too big but I will just wear on another finger"
4.0,Got this on sale and I am excited to wear it when it gets chillier. I washed on delicate as soon as it arrived and my only issue is that one of the stitches in the shoulder snagged. Should be an easy fix but it is kind of annoying that I have to fix something I haven‚Äôt even worn before.
4.0,"The shirt had good quality and looked as pictured, but I had to return it. Runs small in my opinion.  Otherwise a good shirt."
4.0,"great price, serves its purpose. metal used does smell weird. overall price is great and the chain serves its purpose. I would recommend it for costume wear"
4.0,"I like the headbands even though a little tight, they do their job. I was disappointed with the coupon that was sent to me with my headbands it says free $30 now go to headband gift.com after trying on my mobile phone, I also tried on my computer and it does not work. I was going to order some more in different colors but decided not to after not being able to get the website to come up."
4.0,Nice socks! Good quality and don't get fuzz balls. I washed them several times and they look like new. I like the designs too. I got lot's of compliments from other parents.
4.0,Wide enough to use as a shawl but light enough to use as a scarf.  Exactly what I wanted.  One star removed because the white is grayish which is noticeable when put against pure white.
4.0,"My daughter is 29"" tall and 18 lbs amd the 6-12 month fits great with a little room to grow :)<br />I removed the green pompom balls. And I LOVE this outfit now :)"
4.0,"Is soft and wears well but the material is thinner than expected. A nice display piece, or to wear as a way to honor the late, great Kobe Bryant."
4.0,It's a nice robe.
4.0,I just got my nose pierced and had to replace my old nose pin. The hook thingi is a little hard to put in but overall it's good!
4.0,cute necklace but it keeps falling off
4.0,"I wear an XL and bought this in an XL. The top is made of thin material, so it fits a little too big. But I love it and it looks great. I have gotten compliments on it. I love the 3/4 sleeve also.  The round neck is very wide. I hope it shrank a bit after I washed it so that it will be more fitting.  Overall, I love this top!! :-)"
4.0,Love these skirts.  Perfect for work as a server in a tea house.  Very comfortable and cool for summer.  My only wish is that they had pockets.
4.0,I fly for a living.  These are great to use in the cockpit and keep me from having to switch between glasses consonantly.
4.0,These are comfy and fit nicely.
4.0,Served the purpose to expand the game with different sizes of retractors.
4.0,"I thought these earrings were very lovely when I saw them. Honestly I probably didn't pay much attention to the size. The sun charm is about the size of a half dollar, and they were pretty heavy. Those are my own personal preferences though, I can't wear heavy earrings and I can't pull off &#34;stylish&#34; with large earrings. But they are every bit as lovely as the picture, and if you're an expert earring wearer then you'll probably love these."
4.0,Being hard to purchase a suit thru the mail.pleasantly surprised.
4.0,I like the dress but it's a little small.
4.0,Pretty decent quality. Color matched
4.0,"They're lovely. Great look, great price"
4.0,One sided dog tag.  Durable chain and the dog tag is attached well to chain.
4.0,"I really like these, but this captive ball style can be really difficult to get in. Once in and together, they likely won't accidentally come out, as the ball fits in there quite snugly. I wish they made some like these with screw-on ball ends, they would be so much easier to change. I like to change my earrings alot. Or, they could pilot a hole in each side of the ball so the hoop stays in there easier when putting them in. There is only an indentation on each side of the ball for the hoop to fit in (as is true with all captive-ball earrings that I've had). They are a five, but I dinged the score for how hard they are to put in."
4.0,"It's a good shirt for what you pay. I like the simple, contrasting floral pattern. The quality is so-so. The material feels a little low-quality, but not too bad."
4.0,Wish there was more wiggle room in the zipper area. I'm a small and ripped it a little putting it on. Was able to get it fixed tho. Loved the way it fit. Just not crazy about how you get it on.
4.0,I bought these for a friend. She love the color and can wear them all day. She is small footed and said they were large. I am big-footed and bought myself a size 9 of these and my feet swim in them. Which is a good think if you want to wear warm thick comfy socks :)
4.0,"Now these are adorable but if you have thick thighs they will roll down on you, I just used them for a photo shoot and fun but I wouldn‚Äôt try and wear these out anywhere because I‚Äôd constantly be pulling them up."
4.0,Nothing. Good product
4.0,"I wear a medium, which I ordered and this felt like an x-small.  I'm sorry, because it's really cute."
4.0,"Stitching already beginning to come undone after using twice. The product is really nice and works good minus the stitching problem. I may be able to restitch the place so that I can continue to wear it because other than that one problem, I love the product. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear and works good."
4.0,This dress was flattering and comfortable. Fit was as expected based on the reviews.
4.0,Ordered a Large .
4.0,I'm almost 5'3 and I'm 115lbs I got a small but the shirt runs big . it's a really cute shirt .
4.0,"My wife loves this. Fits her great. Very soft and durable and sexy. My wife ordered two other colors. If your looking for something sexy, this is the product"
4.0,"I like both of these pieces. The necklace fits nicely. The bracelet, however, does tend to slide around the sizing string quite a bit. Aside from that, they're great accessories."
4.0,"Fit more like shorts which I prefer. Not as long as I though, ut it works well under shorter dresses"
4.0,"Beautiful dress! But if you‚Äôre blessed in the chest, these buttons are NOT your friend. So disappointed because that‚Äôs the only part that is a little too snug, ordering a size up would be a mistake"
4.0,"My daughter is a size 10, but these seem to run about a size to small so we got an 11 which fit perfect"
4.0,"I ordered my normal size, XL and it's a little snug, across the chest area.<br />I love the print, and color. Great length!<br />I wear a 38D, size 14 jeans, size XL tops, I'm 5'4&#34;."
4.0,"Good case, simple, thin. I have another one now, I didn't feel like it offered MUCH protection but I loved the mermaid tail :)"
4.0,"I literally just ordered this dress Saturday evening...It's monday, and I got it already!  AWESOME!"
4.0,"This is my everyday wear watch. Mowing the grass, camping, biking I wear this. Cyclops window very nice and makes date super easy to read. Decent lume. Bezel easy to turn even without teeth but has a little play if that's important to you. Keeps good time. I like automatics - no batteries to replace. Nice crystal - scratch resistant. Nice water resistance but haven't swam with it yet. Nice looking with brushed and polished stainless steel. Dressy enough if I had to, but also rugged enough for every day activities. Just a tad pricey compared to similar watch brands."
4.0,this fits very big . i have to put it on the last notch .  I have a small wrist.
4.0,is a described.
4.0,He likes them but they seem tighter than others he bought.
4.0,Good sock Good value
4.0,I love the way it made my plus size body look amazing! I had to remove the sleeves because they were too small. Very comfortable
4.0,Product was as expected. For what I needed? Great!!
4.0,Satisfied with this purchase
4.0,"34B 120 lbs 5'7&#34;<br />The pads are awkward in the top almost like it's too big.... maybe they'll loosen up and form better? The bottoms cover you up and they are almost too big. I worry in the water they will loosen too much. If I had a butt though, I probably wouldn't have this problem."
4.0,I love the design on this sarong. It is definitely VERY thin but doesn't seem like it will fall apart.  I washed it once in a washing machine and it's still in great condition. It is a little small depending on your size.  I probably wouldn't recommend it for any plus size ladies.  It will probably look good on size 12 and under.<br /><br />It took a while to get in and arrived after my planned vacation but I knew I was taking that chance when I ordered it as the delivery time frame overlapped with when I was leaving.
4.0,Laces to long
4.0,"Not see thru.  Good tummy control, fabric is a nice weight.  Ordered a large, happy with the fit"
4.0,"They‚Äôre not an exact dupe to the brand with the fish in it, but they‚Äôre pretty darn close! They definitely look like the vital seamless leggings. The only difference is they‚Äôre a bit more stiff. They‚Äôre not as stretchy and they‚Äôre a bit see through so I recommend sizing up. Overall, pretty good leggings for the price."
4.0,"Huge disappointment! I wear a 7,71/2 shoe and have narrow feet the heels of these are under my feet and the picture shows them sitting above the ankle by a few inches but they are short, could never wear these comfortably with a hiking shoe or work boot, which is what I bought them for.<br /><br />After washing and drying the socks I have a new opinion. They fit so much better, they are softer also and have skittle more stretch. Still wish they where a little taller but I do like them better"
4.0,Loved this bracelet.
4.0,Strong material and holds a lot. Great over night bag.
4.0,"Lovely dress. Inexpensive, but well-made. Unfortunately, it ran smaller than advertised so I had to return it and order a larger size."
4.0,Really pretty and good quality! I was very pleased.....
4.0,Not quit what was expecting.
4.0,Fit well.  Good quality for money.  I am very pleased.
4.0,I ordered a large which should have been spot on but hey it fit like a s/m instead of a lrg. I won't like to order a xl to see if it fits better but I'm so nervous to waste more money.
4.0,"Love the color and its high quality. I am 5'5&#34;, 36 D and about 145 lbs. I purchased a large but probably should've gotten an XL bc the cups on the top are smaller than I expected."
4.0,It's cute. Only for stars because I believe it's cheaply made.
4.0,"Product arrived well ahead of expected delivery date.  Packaging was fine (not OVER packaged).  The material , cut and fit are as expected.  I am a big fan of the athletic cut wide shoulders narrow to high waist and flared back at hips.  All good through 1 work out and one wash."
4.0,"Fits good, looks good.  Still waiting for warm weather to get this out on the golf course. My dermatologist will be happy with me for getting a wider brimmed hat!"
4.0,It is a cute cheap set but I ordered a size 11 but was sent a size 10 so it doesn't fit
4.0,cotton is too scratchy for my bold head
4.0,My only issue is the large is a bit tight for wearing a light fleece under garment underneath<br />Great for mountain biking
4.0,Do not seem as rugged as the clear ones I purchased recently from different manufacture. I do like that the angle (very little) as I wear them under motorcycle helmet.
4.0,I think I ordered a size smaller than I meant to I always order a size up when ordering online and I didn‚Äôt this time and it was short and tight so that‚Äôs my bad but.....
4.0,"This is the second pocket watch I have purchased from this seller.  I accidentally broke the first one but I liked the watch so I purchased a second one.  First of all, are these heirloom quality watches?  At these prices, of course, they are not.  But for the price you get a very cool looking watch that people will notice, that keeps adequate time.  It's more than worth the price of the watch to see the reaction of people when you pull it out of the watch pocket of your jeans and flip it open to check the time when everyone else is looking at their phones.  People who see it think it's cool and tend to want one.  It's well worth the price."
4.0,"This dress fit great, I was going back and forth on what size to order but I settled on a large, glad I did because extra large would've been too big. I'm 5'2 197 but small in the waist and chest and thick in the hips and bottom, so if you're pear shape also a large would fit fine. The length comes below my knee but not too long, will look great with a pair of heels. I ordered the wine color, fabric is nice and flexible but doesn't look cheap."
4.0,Makes my patent pumps winterized!
4.0,Cool looking chuckka boot. Nice with jeans<br />A little narrow
4.0,"Earrings a little thinner than expected and had a little trouble getting the back on without bending the post, but okay for the price. Fast delivery, nicely packaged."
4.0,I wish the ankle was a lil tighter
4.0,Amazing customer service.
4.0,"stretchy fabric, comfortable and looks nice"
4.0,"This is really cute, I ordered it for our flower girl for the day of the wedding. Added some other things in it like little snacks, tissues, a bigger unicorn coloring book and some sparkly stickers, a larger box of crayons and a slinky. I love the bag it's cute, the coloring book is cute and it will serve our purpose. I may replace the toy with a better quality one as this one does look rather cheap."
4.0,"It really is a lovely skirt.  Its well made and having the slip on waistband was nice because it was very comfortable and provided a flexible hip to waist ratio...which is hard to find for us big hip girls.  The issue for me was that it was wayyyy too big.  I bought the 1X which I usually fit into snugly and it was just far, far too big.  It looked like a tent on me.  Unfortunately I had to return and it doesn't come in a smaller size so this one didn't work for me.  So order at least one size down from where you would normally order."
4.0,Love the style but cannot button.  I am 135 lbs. and ordered a medium and it's too small.  I'm going to keep it but can't button it.  I like the way it looks open anyway.
4.0,Very cute. However this was sized in like Chinese sizes so When I gave it as a gift I had to let them know what the actual american baby sizes were.
4.0,"It's large and a great product, But on amazon, the advertised logo looks small, What I received had a large logo printed boldly on them that looks gaudy. I do love that the print is on one side.<br /><br />I will be trying a fabric dye pen to cover the logo up,"
4.0,Very pleased with my braclet
4.0,Love it! Exactly as described and VERY soft and very warm. Can be worn multiple ways.Will buy in different colors. Would make great gifts for the winter months.
4.0,I‚Äôve used it just a few times and it seems to be very good. Only complaint is that the strings will come off too easely (haven‚Äôt had a problem with it yet).
4.0,this is real YUKATA from japan company shipping by AMAZON! YUKATA was very cute as pictures but was too big<br />wish they had smaller but appreciate that i could get by amazon instead waiting 2 weeks from japan<br />Now i can go Anime expo with this YUKATA! Thank you KYOETSU san!
4.0,My son loves these but I did not realize that they say ‚Äúfashion‚Äù across the side and back of each shoe :( He can‚Äôt read yet so he could care less and they are summer play shoes so we kept them.
4.0,Other than it firting a little smaller than I‚Äôd like. I love it! I have 2 now!
4.0,it is little fit on me.. I like it.
4.0,Very nice- and it is light. Had to remove links which was a little chore. That's why it doesn't get 5 stars.<br />The pins should have been small screws instead of little pressure pins.
4.0,Cute but large and a bit heavy!
4.0,"This band is very nice but a little too tight and leaves an imprint upon my wrist when I take it off. It is uncomfortable at times and I have to shift it around to alleviate the pressure.<br /><br />I understand it is ""flexible"" and that is what it is supposed to be, but for me, it is a little too tight. For some reason, it seems that most all basic bands for the Apple Watch are made for up to 8.0 inches. I have an 8.2/8.3 inch wrist. Large bands are for 8 to 10, make them too loose for the most part. I was hoping the ""flex-expansion"" of this band would not be too tight, but it is.<br /><br />If anyone has an 8 inch or smaller wrist, this is a very nice band, and attractive for the Apple Watch. Measure your wrist before ordering. Sure could use a couple of extra links if I knew I could add them in to this watch. If I could do that, it would be my watch band of choice."
4.0,this dress is super cute and I love the texture....I did return because it was too big but will reorder a smaller size when they are back in stock.  I am 5'9 Athletic build with 36D top...the length was perfect wasn't too short.  I ordered a medium but it is too big and makes the dress look boxy so going for a smaller size.  I ordered the white dress with black leopard print.
4.0,Good color and looks the same as the picture.
4.0,"Kind of has wind breaker material.  Bunches a little by zipper but over all, like them a lot!"
4.0,These pants fit very well look good and seem to be made of good material
4.0,gift for my daughter - she seems very happy with it.
4.0,"Love the colors.  The fit so good, like actually fit your heal and you can tell if it‚Äôs just a little off.  I like them and broke up one package and have with Xmas gifts"
4.0,"Love the design. The wallet was an extra bonus!  With that said,  it is bigger than I thought.  No divider pockets other than a few small open pockets and one zipper pocket.  I have been trying to keep my purses smaller and crossbody due to back problems.  Choices are so limited with concealed weapon choices.  Overall a nice purse."
4.0,"These bags are soooooo GORGEOUS!!!!<br />Perfect for a girls slumber party, girls weekend or bridal party. We purchased the rose gold. The color is so vibrant. The bag can hold a good bit of items. Not sturdy enough for heavy heavy items though.<br />Would highly recommend. Just missed getting 5 stars."
4.0,"These socks are quite comfortable.  I wore them all day through a cycling session and then around the house. Be aware that they're quite a bit thinner than they look in the picture.  I don't know if that will impact their long-term durability, but it may also impact the fit of some of your footwear.  I did notice that my feet seemed cooler and more comfortable.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the giant logo.  I'm not used to athletic socks with a giant (we're talking golf-ball sized) logo on both sides of my feet and frankly, I think it looks gaudy.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Great but a little too thin
4.0,I love these! They look adorable with boots!
4.0,Great Satchel .I like it
4.0,"The earrings looks pretty and has a nice shine too it, but it was a little bigger than expected. As a result, it doesn't look as delicate or pretty as the picture first made me to believe. The two angles portrayed in the picture are probably two of the best angles to look at these earrings in. Under other angles, the earrings aren't as pretty. Still, it has a pretty different design, and I do like it."
4.0,Nice and light but I have a lot of hair so they are hidden
4.0,"Feels soft, but definitely polyester. Fit was great."
4.0,"I assumed this would be a normal cotton material but it is more of thick, stretchy material. I would prefer the neck line a little looser. Still a cute shirt that I wear often."
4.0,The red color is more like orange.
4.0,It‚Äôs good just get size up
4.0,"the pajamas are comfortable, soft and loose fitting.  They were just as described."
4.0,Good I just think I‚Äôm missisng a size
4.0,Fun sweater. More crop top length than I expected.
4.0,The quality of the band was nice but it shows up more light lilac than white.
4.0,They are beautiful just a little smaller then I expected would buy from seller again.<br />They also arrived early
4.0,Love the shirt and it arrived quick!!
4.0,"Color is good, although material is not too sturdy. Using it on a regular basis could make the product last up to 6-8 months."
4.0,The bag is small and cute.
4.0,Bought if for my 8 year old son. He loves it and is perfect for his needs. it is very simple and light weight.  Good for an adult too.  The handles could be a little more sturdy but it's working out great so far.
4.0,"Cute dress & comfy. I could have ordered a size smaller, it's baggier than expected. I do like it though!"
4.0,Very cute dress...the neck is indeed a deep V so be warned if you don't have boobs like meü§£
4.0,I ordered A/B and they go up so high on my chest- seem too big.
4.0,I love this dress. It has small holes in just the right places. I am five foot two and 130 pounds and got a medium. It is short and stretchy.
4.0,Everything I wanted in a wallet
4.0,Earrings look great.  The reason for the 4 stars is when it came in one of the jewels came off but I was able to fix easily.
4.0,"A little small in the bust, otherwise love it!"
4.0,"Comfy, fits well, flattering design, perfect for summer"
4.0,"I like the socks. The non slip works great.  I have 3 small issues with the socks.<br />1) The grippers themselves are so thick that you actually feel them on the bottom of your foot when not wearing shoes. It gets a little uncomfortable.<br />2) The top colors on the socks should just be gray, white, or black. Not beige & purple. They are odd looking.<br />3) I wish the gripper colors, matched the color of the socks so they didn't stand out so much. All solid colored socks would be best."
4.0,Its light weight not what I expected but its good.
4.0,A little boxy looking. I think I would have liked it better if the top part came down lower. Overall pretty cute and comfy and great price
4.0,"Great fit! Little hazy but hopefully that will clean off<br />Good price, as well"
4.0,"Upon first glance, these gloves appear to be well made.  They feel like they'll keep my hands warm, though it isn't cold enough to test yet.  The sizing runs a bit small.  I ordered XL, the largest size offered.  They're a bit tight on my hands.  I'll give them a thorough testing once the temps drop another 20-30 degrees."
4.0,Loved the fit but the blue pants had a huge run in the back and won't be able to be worn except when working out privately at home. Other than that items fit great and are very comfortable.
4.0,I got this bracelet as a gift for my daughter she loves it!
4.0,The dress fit as expected.<br />The material is lightweight so it can be worn even on the hottest days
4.0,"a little short, just over my 9 year olds bum. Shes small and short so I bought an 8-9. fits everywhere else nicely."
4.0,Cool üòé  nice üëç
4.0,"These fit well and are a nice assortment of colors. The lenses are tinted VERY dark, however - much darker than I wanted. They're so dark that it almost impairs driving when wearing them while driving."
4.0,"good for their money, nice hard case and SMACKS when it closes.."
4.0,I thought these socks would be much thicker as I intended to wear without shoes in the winter to keep my feet warm.  They do not fit the bill.  If I wear in a shoe as a regular sock they feel uncomfortable.  Not going to wear much when the weather is low 30's or lower.  Not recommended as a warm sock.
4.0,They are very nice for the price.
4.0,Runs big but worth every penny
4.0,"I like the style and the soft comfy feel when I wear them. I do wish that they had sent me the color I ordered, but I saw where another customer complained of receiving the wrong color. I guess they were unloading stock, because after Prime Day was over, they were no longer selling shoes. I bought these for less than half of the listed price, so I'm OK. They're not that much of a disappointment."
4.0,I got it a size bigger for my grand sons.  Looked at the reviews. They will grow into them.
4.0,"This shirt is really comfortable. It is soft, airy, and loose just as I wanted. I love the color and the saying, I'm a very slow runner so I'm excited to have a fun shirt"
4.0,"This necklace was a pleasant surprise. It comes in a nice carry case. The chain has an extender and is unusually easy to fasten. The flower itself is well designed and such a pretty color! The gold tone is a little shiny for my taste, and I don't think a box link chain was the best choice for delicate flowers. But other than that a great gift for anyone - even yourself!"
4.0,Great looking watch. The first one I ordered had a malfunction and I was promptly shipped another. Very good customer service.
4.0,"Smaller than I wanted it to be, otherwise it was okay."
4.0,This suit works great in warm water where you need a little more. Fit is good and seems well made for the price. I recommend for that little more you need.
4.0,"Love the feel and fit of the material. The arm length is great because I have long arms. Quality sweater, with a cute sexy feel."
4.0,Very cute shirt...i was surprised at the back design when I got it home....but overall I still liked it.
4.0,Left off a star because the black one seems to be a tad defective.  It comes off all the time.  And unfortunately it's the color I need the most.  The grey and mint/green bands seem to work without a problem though.
4.0,Very good and confort
4.0,"I like the watch very nice, distinguishable great buy for the price. Mines just had a problem with the winding mechanisum.<br />I would still recomend the watch.<br />Thank You<br />Jorge B"
4.0,"Avarage sweatpants, quite comfortable"
4.0,"These pants are very very comfortable. They are not heavyweight like most cargo sweatpants, these are light but still nice and warm and soft. A little bigger than expected based on reviews I was expecting them to run small. But I love them. Perhaps they will shrink a bit in the wash."
4.0,The eye holes were a little smaller on some of the styles but all in all a great buy. Needed a mask for a work party at the last minute. These were perfect.
4.0,"Always a go to brand for me, have yet to be disappointed! -@RicoKnow"
4.0,Some will run too big for your neck.
4.0,Very very light. Great little watch.
4.0,"Beautiful. but a bit large , however am Inlove with it"
4.0,Pockets and comfort-!looks Bohemian chic!
4.0,This outfit is so adorable. I did order a larger size as others mentioned it did run small. It ended up being a great fit!
4.0,I really like the finish on this pin‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a fan of hard enamel versus soft enamel and this pin is very nice‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt give it five stars because there is a defect in the enamel (see photos) but I still like it
4.0,Super cute bag. Love all the pockets. Only thing I wish it came with was a shoulder pad on the strap.
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter. She was very happy with it and said it fit great.
4.0,"The belt is of a good quality and looks great. The only reason I didn't give it five star is that the sizing is WAY off. I saw this on the reviews and ordered a small for my 34-35 waist. It fits fine and looks good, but the manufactuers need to get their act together on the sizing."
4.0,We just received the shoes and my daughter wore them all night without any complaints. The comfort seems good and the appear well made. My only complaint is I ordered 2 pair in the same size. One appeared to be half a size smaller than the other making them too small. We are returning and getting a bigger size.<br /><br />I will write updates if needed.
4.0,"Item arrived as described and was shipped quickly. It is nicely made, as long as you don't look too closely. Kind of Etsy, homemade looking on close examination.  I took 1 star off rating for that."
4.0,"Large Fit very nice but a smaller size would have fit better, I recommend sizing down as it stretches"
4.0,"Bello anillo que va con la persona que lo adquierio<br />""peque√±o pero como brilla!!!"" jajaja<br />Gracias"
4.0,"Light weight, fabric does wrinkle, as noted there are no side seams.  I got it to tuck in a bag and use it for a quick cover up and I think it will work for that."
4.0,Nice and roomy.  All of my travel size bottles fit neatly and are easy to see and retrieve.  I do find the zipper cumbersome to open and close so it's not quick access.
4.0,I like the solid metal buckle closure. I appreciate the great price. The belt fits true to size.
4.0,This is a good product... my niece likes it.
4.0,This is a nice ring. The heart and beat lines are very detailed. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because I would have liked to have seen another heart on the other side. There is only one heart on the ring.
4.0,Cute shirt that my daughter picked out. Just note that it's square rather than fitted and runs somewhat larger.
4.0,"I'm not sending them back, but my heel does come right to the back of the thong.  I usually wear a 9 but wish I had gone up a size.  They are still comfortable and I have bad feet, so I think I will like them if summer ever decides to show up;)"
4.0,"The glowing MIRRAMOR Moonstone ring is pretty with reflected bluish highlights when under lights.  The setting isn't gaudy, but understated, and not heavy on my fingers.  The ring is too large and slips around my finger unless I wear it on my index finger or thumb so it doesn't slip, which is distracting, but that's my fault since I ordered a size 8, a size 7 would have fit.  The silver over brass, well, I'd certainly rather have pure silver because after the silver wears off, the ring won't look nice--but, one hopes, that is some years in the future.  A simple and lovely ring I can wear daily and it won't be too flashy, which is why I love Moonstones."
4.0,Nice size; holds my tablet and all related items.  Very attractive and a nice value.
4.0,The strap slip down easily but besides that the fit is great and they are very comfortable
4.0,Good fit considering purchasing another color
4.0,1 was broke but the rest were good
4.0,The lens is a little loose on one side
4.0,Great picture quality. Soft and comfortable
4.0,I covered some of these with colorful fabric.  Looks great.
4.0,I‚Äôm giving this a 4/5 because I bought about 6 Of the same kind and color but the recent one that came was not the same material even though I reordered the same one. I‚Äôm a little disappointed because this one is thinner.
4.0,"There was only 2 reviews when I saw this rash guard. I take my kids to the water park often and was looking for a rash guard specifically with pockets under $20. I wanted to be able to have pockets to carry my phones on slides that didn't allow my fanny pack. I'm never drenched in water that my phone would get damaged. The hoodie just adds a playful look in my opinion. I am 5' 6"" and 160 lbs and based on the chart, I had to take guess and so I ordered the 10 petite (petite is all they had). It's a good fit. Not lose but not extremely tight either. Most of the time, I just make sure it's free return so I can return."
4.0,smells horrible and I'm not sure how to clean it after I've used it as there were no cleaning instructions. other than that it fits well and keeps the heat in as it's supposed to.
4.0,"I really LOVE this hoodie type top. The only reason I'm. It giving 5 stars Ian because it's a little snug on my upper arms and my chest. I'm a big busted girl though, so I'm sure if you have a little leas than me it would be a perfect fit.<br />Sturdy material, light enough and heavy enough in my opinion. Perfect for fall in the north east."
4.0,Very comfortable. Bevel isn't that pronounced but they still look great.
4.0,This is exactly like the picture but the 2T size is smaller than 18months unfortunately. Great product otherwise.
4.0,Good product and a great price.
4.0,I originally ordered a small as I am 5‚Äò1‚Äú tall and weigh about 105 pounds. When I received it it was tight and dug into my skin. I decided to return and exchange for a medium. The medium fit much better. I like the design of the suit where it helps hid the ‚Äúmom pouch‚Äù with the added ruffle sash.
4.0,It's a little big for my ankle but all in all I really really like it. I got it in the fall so Ive only gotten to wear it a few times. I'll update if needed. ;)
4.0,"This shirt is super soft. It also wicks sweat well. It runs a little tight, and long. Definitely made for tall skinny kids. It works well for my daughter. Sizing up wouldn't really work because then the shirt is even longer, and it already falls mid thigh."
4.0,It was too launch in the waste for my daughter so I had to re-order it in a smaller size
4.0,Wow what a great dress for the money
4.0,comfortable<br />stylish<br />photo is accurate
4.0,I had these before but they were all cotton but I couldn't find any in cotton any longer.  I like that they don't have elastic and just have the tie waist. These have more polyester but feel soft.  I need to hem them so I have not worn them.  They came out fine in the wash and didn't shrink.
4.0,The material is very thin and cool. My daughter wore this outfit in 99 degree weather to a rodeo. We recieved so many compliments. For $6 just buy it. Fits true to size.
4.0,"Very nice ear rings.  needewd adjusting, but instructions were sent on how to do it.  Like them a lot."
4.0,fit well<br />its color is much brighter than i expected
4.0,"I said these fit somewhat small, but to be honest it's hard to say.  I bought this sock for my husband according to the size chart.  When they came in I put them on and they fit me perfectly snug and felt like they had good arch support.  I'm a size 8 women's and my husband is a size 11 men's.  When my husband put the socks on they were stretched very thin.  Much thinner than either of us were used to with socks.  My husband has very sweaty feet usually and these really did help wick.  We're not sure if the main part of the sock breathing and wicking is because the sock is stretched so thin or if it's truly the fabric.  It's just hard to say.  I am worried at how long these socks will last with them being stretched out so much.  We'll just have to see.  These socks really help my husbands feet feel less damp so as long as these are durable these socks would be worth it.  If these are still holding up after a couple months we'll be buying another pair.<br /><br />***I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  When I write a review I still take into consideration the full sell price of the product because as a consumer the price/value matters to me.

4.0,My son is 6‚Äô41/2 tall and he is 11yrs old. I bought this big. But it was a size smaller
4.0,Love the shirt but it was a little snugger than expected
4.0,"The size ""small"" fits really good at the waist, rear-end, and everywhere.  Cotton fabric and pockets are awesome.<br />But I am only 5'1"" and weigh 100 lbs. I have a flat, small, rear-end.  What I found is that they are too short.  If you are over 5'1"" probably wise not to buy a small; the legs will be too short, in my opinion."
4.0,"I always get a Small with pullovers/sweaters and this was slightly bigger than a typical small, as i could easily fit it over another pullover with ease. It did shrink in the dryer which helped and it fits much better over a t-shirt than it did before. The people I live with really like the green colour."
4.0,"Light weight for sure. I'm also 5'11"", 185 and normally wear a 33 waist and like a 33"" length. The size 34 fit great; length with shoes goes to my heels. Waist is snug and no belt needed but if I'm out in the woods I'll likely put one on.  2 pockets in the front and the 3rd one at the angle can maybe hold a chapstick and that's about it."
4.0,my son is working on it
4.0,"I like the gloves, they‚Äôre pretty and my baby (5 yo) likes them. Only thing is that one of the hoops keep getting undone."
4.0,"Great Hoodie! Love the color block, the material is felt so super soft, and the material has some give so can stretch out a little to give a little room around the waist, hips, etc."
4.0,I bought these for my daughter. She said they work pretty well. They certainly help with absorbing moisture.
4.0,"Fits well, hangs nice, in the washer, out of the dryer looking good. It will hang lower than the picture shows. Color a bit lighter, greener"
4.0,"The fact that you get a pair of straps for the price, it made up for my frustration of 2 days.  Great straps though. Love the fact that it has a magnetic clasp that you can adjust"
4.0,It's a little smaller than expected but it still fit and was comfortable.
4.0,"I love these dresses, but they are too low cut to where to school. I have to use a safety pin to close the gap."
4.0,"Beautiful blue color, but a little bit big...  I have way too big earlobe's anyway, so it doesn't matter, and it goes so well with my other blue necklace."
4.0,Great for the gym or just wearing as a loose shirt around the house. Bought for my wife for the gym
4.0,"This set of six pairs of gloves was inexpensive and I've only used one pair on two occasions, so far they have held up well & seem substantial."
4.0,"Beautiful fit, but the backs fell off really easy. Lost one on the first day."
4.0,they were alittle smaller than the ones i orginally had but i like 'em (:
4.0,"This watch has been great to help my 6 year old remember to use the bathroom. He struggles with interrupting his playtime to listen to his body, so this helps give him some much needed reminders! The size of the watch is great for his little arms, the face isn't massive causing it to be a distraction or to be heavy, but his wrists are very small so he has to buckle it on the very last hole and the silicone does rub his wrist a bit when he sweats.<br /><br />He's been using this for about 6 months now and the face is pretty scratched up, but since he really only uses it for the reminder alarms it's okay. If he used it to tell time, I'd have to buy a new one pretty soon. Also, the little sleeve that the band slips into to keep the band from flopping around has started to tear. I used a thin strip of duct tape wrapped around the sleeve to secure it for now until I need to buy a new watch.<br /><br />He's a rough & tough little boy, so I don't expect a long life from this watch, but it definitely serves its purpose!"
4.0,Nice boots and great delivery time
4.0,Material is okay.  The material is very stretchy.  But I think the material could be a little more quality.
4.0,nice quality for the price and nice looking --clasp was a bit hard to open at first.
4.0,These boots are super comfy.....but if you want to wear socks i suggest ordering a half size bigger.
4.0,Watch is big and heavy.
4.0,Great patch adhesive not so good
4.0,I'm 5'8-160lbs and the Large is still very snug. Not the best for comfy lounging however I think they'll be ok as long as I don't dry them in the dryer.
4.0,I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because my sweater runs big! My fianc√© is a large and normally her large are too tight but this sweat run a lil big where the med would‚Äôve fit better. If you want fitted and a lil big get your size if you want tight fitted go a size down
4.0,Very soft and comfy and really loved this product. Earlier I got this product from different seller but the sole was so hard then I had to return them. I am satisfied with this product the comfort and the design pls go for it.
4.0,"Looked fine, just too small for me."
4.0,"This is a very pretty sweater. It's perfect for a nice winter outing. Looks just like pictured. I was very pleased with the fit. I ordered a size up as recommended and that worked. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large and fits me great with 38D measurements. I would have given it 5 stars, only I just tried it on and haven't worn it yet. But, if wearing it goes well it will be a 5 stars purchase."
4.0,"cheap stocking stuffers, my 27 year old daughter took them to work with her, go figure, keyboard with finger lights? gotta get your kicks somehow."
4.0,"I like the color, it was a little bigger than expected"
4.0,"The outfit came together so cute, but I feel like the leggings could of been more stretchy."
4.0,"it was a bit larger than I thought it would be, but i really liked it! not the nicest dress in my closet but I'll definitely get a lot of use out of it"
4.0,"Cute nightgown made with breezy, yet durable material good for spring and summer. It's on the small size, so make sure you order at least one size up."
4.0,paint chips off easy
4.0,Thinner than expected. But not bad.
4.0,"The product looks the way it's pictured and described. I dislike that they're a bit too light and don't have a strong grip when I'm wearing them, so I can't safely put them up on the top of my head when not wanting to wear them for a while without them slipping down easily."
4.0,"i got the night vision ones and regular ones,  pleased with the quality and use the normal ones regularly.<br />I just dont get enough of an effect to bother wearing them at night though,  tried other ones and they have the same lack of effect so i figure my eyes just dont respond much to the yellow stuff."
4.0,Nice youthful dress....more casual than dressy.
4.0,Love it!! Worth every penny. Bought for co workers Xmas gift
4.0,Color is great. Runs small and hand wash so it won‚Äôt shrink.
4.0,Fits well. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be cheaply made. Will use it more in the spring and summer
4.0,Mask was too big. But is a good quality for the price
4.0,"Great leggings! I wanted to write this review after working out in these to see how they hold up. They‚Äôre so worth the price. I did an intense 45-min HIIT workout with all types of jumps and squats and these pants stayed in place the whole time and aren‚Äôt see through at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 145lbs and ordered the small since I wanted more compression. And these things suck it alllllll in hunny. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get them up, but I did and they fit amazing. They‚Äôre flattering and comfortable. These pics are after my workout so you can see a little groin sweat, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me."
4.0,Pocket wasn't sewn but otherwise they fit great.
4.0,"I've had trouble finding TARDIS cases for my LG phones so I was super excited when I saw this! Works really well, picture doesn't wear off easily. The only problem I have is that you can't actually read the words &#34;Police Call Box&#34; at the top."
4.0,Love it love it love it. Great dress for travel can't wait to hit the road.
4.0,"The material is soft and flows well along the body,  but it is a little bigger than I expected for a medium."
4.0,"Exactly what I needed, pretty color"
4.0,"I liked this dress and got compliments, the dress is flattering, but I personally felt it was a little snug, while sitting, the waist was a little too high, so I was constantly adjusting the waist band.  Don't get me wrong, it really is a cute dress, I wear 2XL and probably would have been more comfortable sizing up.  For this reason I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"I'm only referring to the pants in this review, as my son refused to wear the other parts to this ensemble.  :D<br /><br />He did make a very uncharacteristic positive comment about them though, when he first came downstairs, wearing them.  ""Dad, I LOVE these!""  Wow!  Really?  The clothes hater LOVES an article of clothing?!  Unheard of!<br /><br />Anyway, great snuggly pants for cold winter nights, though they are not THAT thick...I would call them a lighter weight material, though definitely cold weather.<br /><br />Will update review after a few washes since that is key.  As of now, easy 4 stars."
4.0,Great fathers day gift for all dodger dads! Fit is good. The color is vibrant. The lettering has already started to crack but that is unfortunately common with these tees.
4.0,Cute glasses but not the clearest to see out of
4.0,"I spent extra on pair of these for my daughter to wear to a wedding.  The reception was at a campground.  She walked all over and the shoes got covered in ash, top and bottom.  I figured they were ruined, but put them on her the next day anyway for a trip to the park.  When we got home, they looked new again.  This situation repeated itself a few weeks later at a geyser in Yellowstone.  The shoes were caked in grey mud but a brief dusting brought them new again.  Amazing!  I give 4 instead of 5 stars because the velcro strap scratches pretty badly if the shoes aren't worn with socks.  Not a big deal for us, but something to be aware of."
4.0,"The adjustment buckles are a little too wide so they have to be pulled thru loops sideways in my Dockers type shorts.  It would probably be fine with regular jeans though.  Overall, very handy and comfortable to not have a belt buckle digging into my belly every day."
4.0,Still working a year later. Big watch and the right price for big watch lovers.
4.0,Very cute and Comfortable!  Will work out great for my daughter to wear all day at Disney!!
4.0,The pearl on these earrings were a bit bigger than o expected them to be but still beautiful
4.0,"It's a little small, it ripped after the 2nd wash, better hand wash"
4.0,My daughter loved them ‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,"We bought these to use as face coverings instead of masks. They've worked great and my kids love calling themselves ""the colorful bandits."" :)<br /><br />Good value for the money, and they don't fade or bleed when washed. Didn't notice any shrinking from the dryer, either."
4.0,"Our school colors are red/white/blue, so these were perfect.  I bought them for the last game of the season for the girls on my daughters basketball team, and they all loved them.  It was fun watching them play that day with every one of the kids wearing them - super cute.  Quality was good and they fit well on the wrist of all of the 10-year old girls.  Recommended."
4.0,does come down pretty low with cleavage. need safety pin if wearing to work
4.0,"I love this shawl, it's super comfortable and keeps me warm during the times that the weather is too warm for sweaters and jackets but still too cold for tank tops and short sleeves. The only issue I have with it is that it's constantly slipping off my shoulders slowly and I've already noticed some loose threads here and there."
4.0,"I like the quick snap up shirt , in case off shirt on fire you can quickly rip off the shirt . It is a very thick and heavy shirt."
4.0,"This is a good yoga/lounge bra.  It doesnt offer the most support but it isnt horrible.  The straps are not adjustable so fit can be a little tricky. The pads are pretty thick/bulky but they are removable. Overall, it is very comfortable."
4.0,"So I got this thinking my size 34DDD would accurately for in the top, the top dose NOTHING to keep them from sliding out the bottom with movement. Considering what this was bought for, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The top I thought was a mesh or see through but sadly it's just a black spandex. The skirt fits wonderfully. It's classic yet sexy. The only real reason this received a 4 was the AWEFUL excuse for a tie. It's a piece of fabric strip with elastic straps to tie it around your neck. I highly recommend not using it or getting a different time all together. Easy mood killer for me."
4.0,"This unique little necklace is so pretty and almost perfect. Came before the estimated time of delivery. The necklace had little pleasant surprises of a little cloth bag and a security clasp. The necklace's catch was missing the spring to close it though, aside of this the necklace is perfect. I love the unique design and it sparkles so elegantly."
4.0,"Really like them. The quality is very good; and they look great with casual or formal night out. The negative is the weight, they tend to the heavy side."
4.0,"Sweater was comfy and warm, but the edging style made it tight around the hips with no elasticity. That was my one negative about it. Besides that, everyone loved it!"
4.0,"Very comfy. I wore them to be once because they were so comfortable I forgot I had them on. Good for when I work out too, my feet don't slip on my mat or the floor. Plus they look cute"
4.0,Great hat! Took tape measurements before ordering and ordered based on those results. The hat came and was just a bit too tight. I fixed it by using a metal cookie mixing bowl. Laid the bowl upside down and stretched the hat over the top all the way. Also ironed the hat a tiny bit to make the flaps straighter. Left the hat on the bowl for a week and it fits perfectly now. Looking back I would of bought one size larger though. Still it's a very nice hat!
4.0,"Stylish, a little tight, but I'm sure will loosen up with wearing.  Love it."
4.0,very comfortable with great tread for bad weather
4.0,Keeps the rain off. Haven't tested it in wind yet.
4.0,Color is beautiful but fits larger than expected
4.0,I actually returned the dress as the print didn't look good on me.  The size small dress did fit me and I wear a size 6.  I am also 5'5'' tall and the dress come just below the knee. This info may be helpful to someone.
4.0,for the price...very nice.
4.0,Very cute product. It kept sliding off of my wrist. The magnet was not strong at all
4.0,I purchased this jacket it is absolutely beautiful one problem though I wear a large thinking that I was supposed to wear a sweater or something underneath I ordered a two extra large two two extra large was actually tight on me therefore had to return if you wear a large order a 3X
4.0,"I liked it, but it was a gift so I‚Äôm not able to give much worry for you."
4.0,Loved the color. Bling covering came lose in 3 weeks. Threw the band away. Was very flimsy.
4.0,"In all honesty, I laughed hysterically when this dress came in the mail. It's a bit big, but not too bad. I bought it for Halloween anyways, so it's no big deal for me. The colors are dramatically differing from the photo images. It will be great for my purpose, but not gonna be for daily wear with absolute certainty. The shipping was great and fast. Worth four stars alone."
4.0,"Love these compression socks and would recommend them, however, if you are concerned about the cost, you should know this: these exact same compression socks are sold by Blitzu (#1!Air Travel) for half the price. Look at the photo I attached- you can see them side by side. I did a test to ensure they are the same- I wore one Blitzu on the left foot and one Wanderlust on the right foot on a 14 hour day where I was mostly on my feet. I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. Both worked wonderfully, were supportive, prevented swelling, and had a nice cushion without causing my feet to sweat! I‚Äôd save the $8 and buy the Blitzu."
4.0,"Luv'em<br />Thx,"
4.0,"The pin on the back is rough and rusty and messes up anything I try to pin it to. Other than that, it is very pretty and cool-looking."
4.0,They are good drive glasses
4.0,I am really happy with this pair of earrings; not too small or too big.  Great for everyday use and quite pretty.
4.0,I was replacing an existing pair that I owned.<br />I like that they have bigger shades vs traditional aviators.<br />However these are on the wider side and they fall off my face.
4.0,Lleg√≥ un poco m√°s grande de lo que  la esperaba
4.0,"They look great and have a nice feel, however, they are considerably tighter than other styles of the same brand, size, and compression."
4.0,Beautiful! Wear it every day!
4.0,Tight fitting but still comfortable I wear these under my scrubs! Im a size 14/16 (U.S.) and I got XXL and it‚Äôs just right.
4.0,Not a bad purchase it's a little longer than anticipated but not bad.  The color was nice. Got the green.  It is soft.
4.0,I love that they came in individual bags. They were easy to put together and looked great! My only complaint is that some of them wouldn't remain together. My readers loved them and the 100 went rather fast at my table at the book signing. I plan on ordering more.
4.0,Dress looks good but fits small
4.0,Had them for a months and just now turning colors
4.0,This runs a bit small... Still looks great! Good quality!
4.0,loved these but lost one within 3 days.  needs much more secure clasp<br />  so sad.
4.0,I've gotten several great clothes from this cool co.  Liked them all.
4.0,"Very good material. Overall, a good wallet for the price. It is a little wider than I like, but still suits my needs"
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband.  We like the way it opens up and makes cards easy to view and find. We do wish it had the capacity to hold more cards.  Otherwise, it's great."
4.0,"Bought as gift for husband.  His usually size of 11 was a bit too tight/small, so sent back and ordered 1/2 larger.  Very happy with the purchase.  Likes that can wear around the house but also look good to wear outside as well."
4.0,Very pretty. Super sparkly. Kind of light weight but knew that with the price. My big complaint is that the shipping took much longer than promised and wasn‚Äôt delivered by Christmas.
4.0,"The cut of this dress was good, but the material is very thin and clingy. Finding something to wear underneath that doesn't show through was difficult!"
4.0,5'10 and I didn't feel 'exposed'. Length is great. Perfect for summer. A little unshapely around the middle but it's very flowy and pretty. Love the color (light blue). Lots of compliments.
4.0,"I love this dress! However I am very lucky. I wasn't sure was size to get this dress in but I decided to get a small and its a good thing I did. I am not a big girl, 5'2&#34; 130lbs. I have a 35 hip 28 waist and a 34DD chest and the dress is still a little big in the chest area (and that is not something I am used to feeling in a small)!! Its a very good thing I went with my gut and got the smaller size. :)"
4.0,I like it very week in fact I love it
4.0,Inside diameter too small.
4.0,First this dress looks exactly like the picture shown so I was very happy with that. I am 5‚Äô1 110 lbs so I am quite small and the dress was a bit long for my liking but nothing a hem couldn‚Äôt fix. Besides the length I was very happy with the overall fit because there is an elastic band around the seam where the skirt meets the bodice so it can stretch to fit a multitude of sizes.The dress is quite thin but not see through so I think it‚Äôs perfect for summer. In the picture there are little gaps between where the buttons connect and it looks like quite a gap in the picture however the gap in the dress I received is not as wide which I am more comfortable with but obviously the gap changes based on the size of the wearer. Overall I am very very satisfied with this dress and I can‚Äôt wait to order more colors in the future.
4.0,Love the color and fit.  This dress arrived way before the expected date and for that I was grateful .  My only complaint is the sleeves are a little short ( I have long arms).  I wore  The dress anyhow and rolled up the sleeves .  I got a lot of compliments while I was out.
4.0,"Great top, pretty good quality for the price."
4.0,"Served the intended purpose, clipped to fabric and didn't slip."
4.0,GELIN 14k Solid Gold Diamond Zodiac Necklace for Women-<br /><br />This neckless is cute but it‚Äôs on the small side.  The pendant is a decent size the chain is very slim though. Not abnormal for an average woman's reckless. It does look very nice.  I like the subtle design with the stars.  The diamond is very small so I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs noticeable unless you're looking up close.  I do like how it adds a bit of sparkle to the zodiac pendant.  The Gemini symbol is very cute.  I think this works great for a gift particularly.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Zodiac design.  Added personalized element.<br /><br />Cute small diamond.<br /><br />Real gold.<br /><br />Cons-<br />Presentation could be better.  The case this comes in just looks a little bland for real gold jewelry.  It reminds me more of what cheaper jewelry would come in.<br /><br />Overall I like this neckless.  If it didn‚Äôt have the zodiac symbol I would be a bit more critical but I really like that element.  It makes this more of a personalized gift if it‚Äôs being gifted or a nice way to add your zodiac symbol into your wardrobe.  I would like to see a better presentation in the case at this price point though.  The quality is decent just need to be cautious as the chain is delicate.
4.0,"I love this skirt and thankfully read all the reviews. I am 5'6'' 128 lbs and I had to order an XL, when I normally wear a small. It's perfect length and fit. I am not a huge fan of the black band, I do wish it matched the skirt color more."
4.0,Bought it for my mom to wear
4.0,"Looks great. Feels great. Downgraded a star because the quick release pins are not secured in the band.  So, when you try to put the band on the watch, the pins easily fall out before you can secure them which is mildly annoying."
4.0,"This is a rather large pendant. It's color is nice, and being brass, it will tarnish over time. It looks nice, but just from an observational view, it looks cheap. If it were smaller, I think it would be more realistic, and appear more valuable. It would also not be as bulky. Still, if you like big jewelry, this might work for you."
4.0,Good durag jus the straps are a little short I have a big head so that's a point for you
4.0,The suit has great structure but fits a little large in the chest area. Besides that I love it!
4.0,"I purchased this dress for a rehearsal dinner for  my friend's wedding. It was perfect for the occasion however, as stated in some of the other reviews; the underskirt is very short which made it uncomfortable to wear. The dress itself is gorgeous but I would suggest getting a size bigger."
4.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding because an influencer recommended it. She seems smaller than me so I figured I might be able to squeeze into the small (the smallest size offered when I purchased) but I was disappointed when I tried it on because it‚Äôs too big. The length is also longer than expected (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and it hit at my calf) and the pockets, which are nice to have in a dress, added bulk at my waist. Maybe this wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in a properly fitting dress but as there are no extra smalls, I‚Äôll have to return. The dress is a nice quality, though, and would be nice for weddings or parties."
4.0,quick delivery and washable and comfortable shoe
4.0,"For the price, it is good, worked perfectly. Runs really small however. Also it is a bikini fit, so very low and results in ‚Äúbusted biscuits‚Äù if you hold weight on your hips and midsection. A large is like a small."
4.0,I was pleased with this purchase for the money spent.  I have worn the ring since I got it last month and it has not turned.  The only think I don't like is the little marking on each piece.
4.0,It's a skirt
4.0,I like these but they are smooth on one side. I would have liked them more if both sides had detail.
4.0,VERY COMFORTABLE - PERFECT SUMMER DRESS / ordering some other colors today - great price
4.0,"Beautiful hat.  The knitted band makes it very warm and secure in truly nasty winter weather, but it also makes it snug-fitting, which annoys me<br />a bit."
4.0,"Inaccurate review led me to buy these spring bars attempted to replace the bent ones on my Orient Ray II.  But due to the slightly greater outer diameter, which is 1.8mm instead of 1.6mm for my Ray II.  They didn't fit.  But I kept them in case of some other watches fit.  Thank you for the wonderful product!"
4.0,"Not as tight as you'd expect for compression socks, but they aren't too bad. The elasticity is starting to give after a short amount of usage unfortunately. Cool design, not terrible for the price, but not exactly a high quality product either."
4.0,They are beautiful and exactly as described.  They are so detailed it's hard to see exactly what's going on in such a small area.  I still love them and still wear them with the matching necklace.
4.0,"Small delicate looking, fits well on upper ear.  Very nice dressy look<br />Granddaughter really enjoys wearing this ear wrap with jeans or dressup."
4.0,"I am petite 5'4&#34;, 34B.The elastic is tight around my ribs and the opening is a bit too low, so it is not my favorite workout bra. I like the color."
4.0,My daughter loves them.Lirs of color options on lights. Only problem was 1 shoe came without an insole.
4.0,"its a beautiful top, the bad part is the right sleeve. (where your shoulders show)its a little bit tight  you do have to tuck it in to your jeans because the top is boxy"
4.0,Very comfy a bit feminine but great for price !  My guys love how easy to slip on and go and who doesn't love the hawks now?
4.0,"Looks just like shown. It is a warm cream color with distinct crows flying, the front pleats are cleanly pressed and the ruffles around the shoulder hole are very impressively layered. Would totally buy again."
4.0,"Very comfortable. I love the pink color. Also, it has the thumb holes so you can easily add another layer on if it's cold. It's tight fighting but I would say it is true to its size it's just a tight fitting shirt. Very cute."
4.0,"Very comfy. The neck area is a little wide for me, too close to shoulder. I bought for lounging, so I‚Äôll deal with it. Love the colors. I bought several."
4.0,"Difficult to iron (and ABSOLUTELY needs to be ironed before it is worn) because of the pleats and the material. Looks cute, I always get conpliments, but just know that is not an ‚Äúeasy care‚Äù item."
4.0,"Love this dress! Got it for my honeymoon trip to Belize and it was so breezy and comfy in the hot air and ocean breeze at night. It was a bit shorter than expected (I am 5'5"") and it hit above the ankle.... but it didn't matter, it still was the cutest thing once on and just overall very comfortable while making me look good."
4.0,A must have for any stalker or outdoor enthusiast.  Comfortable faux fur lining. Very warm and functional lenses to protect against snow blindness or speed cameras.
4.0,"Top is small, more like 3T. Bottoms are 4T. Hope it wont shrink after wash"
4.0,My daughter really likes these however they are kind of tight and hard to spread apart
4.0,"I really like the shorts.  I am a size 6 but a little curvy so when I measured I was between the Medium and start of the Large. I‚Äôm glad I got the large, the fit perfectly and are comfortable.<br /><br />I ordered the gray, but as you can see in the<br />Photo they are sand.  I don‚Äôt know if I got the incorrect item or if it is just not gray.  I kept them anyway."
4.0,"They are super soft and warm. However, one of the thumbs were ripped when I received them."
4.0,Not long lasting but good forbehat it is
4.0,"I‚Äôve tried most of the packable, lightweight, travel hats on Amazon.. this one is the best. Stretchy, comfy, low profile, easily adjustable. Only issue I have is the brim - there is zero structure to the brim. You can seriously fold it in half and it pops right back. It‚Äôs floppy. You cannot shape it at all."
4.0,"Lightweight, comfortable and adjustable. Provides good protection from the sun. Can't speak to how quickly it dries because it hasn't gone through very sweaty scenarios."
4.0,"This was a great buy, just wished I'd gotten it a little smaller. But overall,  I love it!!"
4.0,I ordered these as a Christmas gift for a 16 year old girl and she loved them!  They came in a pretty silver pouch too.
4.0,"This look is eveyrthing!!!! The pants are large around the waist, I have to roll and tuck a little. I'm too heavy so I had to order s large but I could Get away with a medium or even a small bottoms."
4.0,"I guess it was my fault, but I thought the 1/2&#34; vs 3/4&#34; referred to how far apart the Rows of hooks were, not how far apart the height of the hooks was. This is a very important distinction and I should have ordered the 3/4 but didn't realize."
4.0,"This sandal is really nice, just the only thing is that the size is not perfect. Its a little bigger than expected so I will exchange it. Other than that its really nice."
4.0,"Cute, fit well, made a good gift."
4.0,Previous reviews noted to go up one size which I did but the belt was still too short. The belt itself was great. Re-ordered and went up a second waist size.
4.0,"Dress is beautiful, flattering fit.  4 stars because  when I raise my arms to dance it comes up about 6 inches and you can see a little too much.  Sad though because I love this dress."
4.0,nothing better than the OLD GLORY belt buckle..
4.0,"Bought these to replace the worn stock sticks on my first gen SN30 Pro (1st gen were SNES and SFC styled). They fit like a glove and work fine. I had a slight issue at first but it was my fault in putting it in and screwing it on incorrectly. Otherwise, if you have an original SN or SF30 Pro, these sticks will work perfectly. No need to file anything down. You‚Äôll get these faster than getting free replacements from China."
4.0,"It is a cute top. However, I got one that had obviously been returned. It came balled up and wrinkled in an unsealed bag. I order from PB often and this is the first time I have had this happen. That being said, it is still cute. Sucks that I have to have it cleaned before I can even wear it once. For the price I don‚Äôt think I should have gotten a shirt that is so obviously preworn and in need of cleaning. :("
4.0,"It's fine, but another time I'd probably get one a little bigger."
4.0,FBRIC NICE.  FIT NICE.  STYLE..MORE STRAIGHT THAN ALINE AS SHOWN IN PIC.
4.0,"Well I would have given this 5 stars but this did not come in the pattern that I saw on the model. Instead of the pretty roses, I got various flowers...it looks kind of old lady-ish but I guess it's okay... And I had SO much trouble putting it on, I usually fit their x-small and small dresses okay, but  this dress was really tight and difficult to put on.<br /><br />I did like the style of the dress, how it hugged my hips, and showed off all the right curves. I was expecting this to be a stretchy dress but this is a very cotton like fabric, not a breathable fabric. Nonetheless, I like the dress but I wish it was bigger and the pattern I got was as advertised..."
4.0,Suits my needs perfectly.
4.0,"These are so stiff they‚Äôre hard to get used to wearing, but my feet stay warm and dry!"
4.0,Going to wear it to a music festival. It's fine but it probably won't fit everyone's head...it's a bit shallow LOL
4.0,Very comfortable and warm as well as a lot of mobility and style! A good first pair of joggers. They do sit a little differently than I anticipated but they fit pretty okay once they shrink in the wash a bit
4.0,I bought these for my sister for Christmas. The warmth of the tone in the metal was great quality. My sister and I are very pleased with the product.
4.0,"It fits very well and the black blends flawlessly as if it were actually the watch.  The design could be improved by a slightly thicker portion around the outer edges of the screen for a bit better protection.  Overall, I am happy and I would order again."
4.0,"They are true to size but a chunk of the rubber covering the toes was missing one one shoe when they arrived so we are sending them back and getting a new pair. They're cheaply made so I don't expect them to last super long, but my daughter only needs them for dress up occasions. They're comfortable, though, and can easily be worn with socks, which are both musts for my daughter."
4.0,Love the look of this dress but the size ran smaller than I expected. Sadly it's just a bit too small for me to wear and enjoy but it is beautiful
4.0,They are great for my 4 year old's shoes! They didn't quite fit lacing them the standard way but lacing them across worked perfectly.
4.0,"just a bit tight, but but may loosen with wear."
4.0,I like the style and is very comfortable
4.0,Very nice made clasp could of been stronger and thinner than most braclets! Over all it‚Äôs ok but nice looking
4.0,"Great socks, but they are very thick and warm."
4.0,Just received them last week. So far I am very happy with them. After having cataract surgery and Lasik surgery to replace glasses. I enjoy being able to purchase my favorite style of sun glass again. No prescriptions needed. Picture speaks for its self.  I wasn't sure if they would fit. I checked out the measurements posted and they are a good fit. No more expensive prescription sun glasses.
4.0,Written by a girlfriend: The dress is amazing for the price and accurate to the movie. It is thin though. I got a size 6 (the largest size in stock). I am a size 8-10 in pants. A size Medium or 6-8 in dresses. The bottom area is very tight. While the top is slightly loose but that may be due to the style of the neckline. The length is perfect for my height at 5'3.
4.0,"Nice Material, Fits Well I will buy more you need to add more colors. Price Right for its style and Quality..."
4.0,"have very sensitive  ears.  have worn 3 times with no reaction. cute hoops. i prefer larger but happy to be able to wear earring again !<br /><br />update since writing this review i have purchased 2 more pairs from this company. no metal reaction at all. However, the back of one earring is so tight i can hardly get it on or off. And the other pair so loose i nearly loose it. Unfortuantely, will not be purchasing again."
4.0,"Love this brooch!  It‚Äôs the perfect size and is priced just right.  One stone was loose when it arrived but, I glued it back and it‚Äôs perfect now."
4.0,Fits great and material is nice
4.0,La calidad no es exactamente como se ven en la foto
4.0,Colorful and awesome. Love these.<br />Very pleased with purchase.
4.0,"Definitely order a size up from what you think you'll need. Glad I listened to the other reviews. Bottoms fit perfect but the top is way too small for busty girls, like myself."
4.0,"I'm 5 feet tall, so it's a full coverage wrap, the printing is crisp and bright, the neck ties are a bit annoying, but overall, a great item."
4.0,My son like this mask and had no issues with wearing them at school. Fun print and comfortable...win win!
4.0,Nice watch but hard to vew background face information.
4.0,"A little small, but still worked."
4.0,Very cute for a one off wedding and a kid that is good at getting shoes off.
4.0,I wear a size 8 and have no problems with these staying on.  The clear silicone grip on the inside helps the socks to stay in place no matter what shoe I wear them with.  I wash them in the bag they come in and DO NOT put them in the dryer.  They air-dry quickly and they have lasted me wearing them almost everyday for over 9 months.  The lace edge is a fun pop of style with shoes.
4.0,This buckle is great for the price<br />Only issue I have is the part that goes into the hole on the belt it‚Äôs self is a little sharp and it has gotten caught on stuff and really snagged it<br />But other than that I love this piece
4.0,This is a beautiful set but it was too small for me to wear comfortably. I thought I had ordered it in the correct size but I obviously didn't. I'm hoping to be able to wear it in the future.
4.0,Good.  Very fast shipping
4.0,"Great item fits perfect, great cost."
4.0,Pretty color - didn‚Äôt hold up great after a few washes but it‚Äôs really cozy and a nice color.
4.0,I like this wrap coat but the pockets are sort of awkward.
4.0,"The hat is what is, it is small on my (adult male, 6') head, but fits my wife's (adult female, 5'1"") head perfectly."
4.0,"Good bracelet.  A bit stiff at the edges of the metal case, but not a big problem..  I have worn it approximately 10 times and have had no issues with quality.  It opens by inserting the ‚Äúguitar type pick‚Äùinto the seam and twisting slightly.  Case pops right open.  Might be a bit  difficult for anyone with visual or arthritic issues.  I would order from this company again."
4.0,Good bags but they aren't &#34;square.&#34; If you hold the bottoms they don't match but other than that we really like them and will buy more.
4.0,Fabric is thinner than I expected but still provides light support.
4.0,"I decided to leave this sweater for my wife, because it's small for me. thanks a lot. Eugene I would recommend this sweater to my friends."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this dress. The dress is tailored with front and back darts, has a zipper, and neckline and armholes have facings.  The fabric is thicker than I expected so a full lining isn't needed. (wearing dresses with lining during the summer in southern California is too hot for me)  Unfortunately,  the sizing is too small.  I am 5'7 135 lbs and usually wear a size 8.  After  previewing the size chart and other reviewers comments, I sized up and ordered a size large.  Still too small. There is enough stretch to the fabric that I was able to get the zipper up but it felt and looked like I was wearing a sport-bra"
4.0,I LIKE THE LENGTH AND LOOKS OF IT. VERY SHINY AND PRETTY. JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WILL RECOMEND IT
4.0,"Not a bad casual necklace for the cost but I think I should have just gone with the moon design as the raw crystal design rolls around a lot so you're not always looking at a nice tree. It did help a bit to push the loop wire forward, but it inherently rolls around. That issue aside, the necklace looks pretty good material-wise. The chain is decently long although a little thin for a heavy pendent, may end up swapping it for a thicker one. The black stone is pretty close to flawless."
4.0,Great auction.  Thanks
4.0,"LOVE this dress.  Ordered a medium, fits very nice.  The only issue - WAY TOO LONG.  I'm 5'4.  I was expecting it to be long but not literally dragging the floor.  It would be nice if it came in Petite or shorter lengths for the vertically challenged. :-)  Otherwise, the dress is great. If it weren't for the length, I would definitely buy in all colors."
4.0,Great quality shoes for my daughter. Started pealing a bit on the sides but their good shoes overall.
4.0,Size 10 show and these just fit me
4.0,"I absolutely loved this outfit!!! After reading the reviews, I was ok with ordering it! I ordered a large in this outfit and I am 5‚Äô8 and I weigh 195 üò´ but the large was a perfect buy! I‚Äôm not wearing this until I arrive in Jamaica for a much needed vacation and a night out with my hubby! I will post pictures then! Although I‚Äôm only giving this outfit due to an awful smell (like burning metal) on the so called  rhinestones but other than that.... I‚Äôm wash and apply downy fabric softener üëçüèæ"
4.0,"HANDIC Angel Wings and Halo are very cute for smaller kids. This may work for adults, but will look very small. This is great for little kids like mine, who like to have a few different articles for dress-up play. This set would also be great to use for photo props or costumes. I'd recommend this set because it's made well for what it is, and has provided a good value for play."
4.0,"I like this sweater. It fits well, with a gorgeous colour that doesn't seem to fade. But I washed this maybe twice and it already has a hole in the collar. Like seriously?!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a very nice comfy sweater but the neck isn‚Äôt as wide as it is on the model. I wish it were.
4.0,"I like them, but it feel like a little bit small from standard men size"
4.0,Great robe for the summer-lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,Very soft supposed to come in Christmas wrapped but didn‚Äôt
4.0,I ordered this a size bigger than I would normally order because my size wasn‚Äôt available in the color I wanted. I‚Äôm glad I did because it fits well.<br /><br />This turned out to be a cute light weight sweater. What isn‚Äôt shown in the photo is that it is a high low which is cute.
4.0,"The beanie itself is on the smaller side. The fleece lineing on the inside keeps you warm but also prevents the beanie to stretch.<br />I usually prefer snug beanies so they don't fall off but this was a bit too snug for my liking.<br />The zipper compartment is nice; judging from a tailor point of view. The zipper is properly stitched in with enough slack on both sides so it won't tear out.<br />Sound quality wise, it's better than expected. Bass is present and decent for the price given. Volume wise, I can keep it on 11/30 volume to enjoy my music and still be wary of my surroundings. In a silent environment, library, classroom etc, others can hear you at vol 14. At Max volume it's not static-y like other audio devices I've had.<br /><br />Problems, the inside is Velcro (underneath the zippered layer of fleece so you don't feel it). I've found that it's hard to fully adjust it to your ear placement just because the beanie is small. It also tends to slide out of place because it's a flat, over your ear, type of speaker thing. (Honestly don't know how to describe that better sorry).<br />If I wanted to be incognito with it however, people can tell if you're using it because the blue LED will flash as you listen to anything. And while its useful when pairing, the flashing is a dead giveaway."
4.0,the string holding to together seems really weak and easy to snap. but that is a very easy fix.
4.0,"Much smaller than I anticipated, even after checking measurements."
4.0,Very comfy there are a little small on the length. i did see some reviews saying buy one size up but i  figured it would be ok for me. Sure enough there just barley the right size theres no extra  room. its just a little small. orderd a 12 like my regular shoe size and  a 13 would have been perfect<br />.
4.0,"Finally, a romper that fits me!!  Not too small or too baggy anywhere, and it's actually kind of flattering on my figure. (5'5&#34;, 160 lbs.) Its Asian sizing and that's always a big &#34;IF&#34; for me whether or not it's going to fit, even going by the size guides. Technically, going by the size chart, this one shouldn't fit so well, unlike the other 50 I have tried on and returned that should have fit, but didn't....  Its not too short either so I feel comfortable wearing it (I'm no spring chicken) I haven't actually worn it out yet, waiting for the right occasion, but it seems to be well-made, and doesn't look like it will fall apart too easily. The seams are all finished and there were no loose threads or &#34;skipped&#34; stitches anywhere-- something that I've found fairly often on less expensive clothes from overseas. The fabric is soft and isn't wrinkly looking. I'm so pleased!! (and pleasantly surprised!)"
4.0,"The face of the watch is much smaller then it appeared in the picture, for that i was a little disappointed"
4.0,Got these for Christmas gifts for my nieces. Nice size for little ones.
4.0,"This set came quickly, was packaged adorably with a little hanger and raffia even---perfect for a gift. Super cute and stylish as well. Do order a size up, though. Mine was only worn a couple of times because it was too small."
4.0,I ordered these boots for a friend and he said he really liked the look and also the fit.  The only negative thing he said was that the laces seemed a bit short.
4.0,Great value. Really soft. Thin material but comfy for Sleep and around the house.
4.0,Est√° gargantilla est√° bonita lo √∫nico que cuando la uso se enrrollan las dos por eso nole di cinco estrellas
4.0,Worked really well and had good battery life but about 8 did not work so didn't give 5 stars.
4.0,ruffle skirt layering isn't as visible as in the photos.<br />Not a lot of Pleat yfm?
4.0,Most the style. Least the under lining is very thin.
4.0,"This is a cute pendant - the star and the moss definitely look plastic, but the shells are real, the sand is a beautiful pearly hue, and the size is perfect - large enough to see the stuff inside, but not enormous. Such a great keepsake of beach time!"
4.0,"Very lightweight, comfortable and cool.  This is very important to me at work as it is over 100 with 100% humidity.  They do look nice but they wrinkle pretty badly.  I have even taken them out of the dryer before they are done and it didn't help much."
4.0,Great fit. Nice quality!
4.0,I should have bought the next size up for personal preference but it fits me normal.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 140lbs and bought a medium.  Very shear.
4.0,But didn‚Äôt fit well‚Ä¶
4.0,Light weight shoe.  Needs extra cushion for cleats.  You can feel the cleats when in use.  Overall good shoe and did its purpose for me.
4.0,"This is elegant, gorgeous, and came beautifully packaged in a royal-blue satiny bag--but lightning bolts feel ""right"" to me when they make an S shape (I'm aware the picture shows it ""backwards"") and my plan to just flip it around is foiled by 925 STERLING SILVER etched in teeny letters on the back.  I may try to buff it out, and I may just settle for it being ""backwards"" instead.  I haven't decided.  It's too elegantly made and beautiful to consider returning, and I don't know anyone else who would like it to gift it.  I really miss when Marilyn Manson's ""Antichrist Superstar"" was popular, because THAT was the perfect lightning bolt.  Alas, the search continues."
4.0,"The product arrived quickly and Is really cute. It is a little on the small size when it comes to length, I have smaller ears and it barley fits, I wish that it was a little longer. other than that I really like it and it is comfortable to wear."
4.0,"At first look, it looks like it was made cheaply, and my feet are way too big for the disc itself.<br /><br />I investigated it and it seems as if my weight would not be good on this device.  It does not state what the maximum weight limit is on this.  Sadly.<br /><br />I have been starting to try and get healthier lately and I figured this device I could use and its safe around my children.<br /><br />I stood on it and could tell it was made with someone who's feet were way smaller than mine, but it is what it is.  When I was on it for a mere 3 minutes I could already feel my abs were getting a work out, besides this being made for someone who has smaller feet the only other complaint I have is that since I am heavier, the disc seemed to be making a cracked noise every time I twisted.  I will continue to use it for the time being until I find something that will fit me.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ZU101SU Bial EX Figure Trimmer Twisting Waist Ankle Body Aerobic Exercise (black)]]"
4.0,Fit as expected and comfy! It needs a cami underneath but good buy.
4.0,"I wear compression sleeves for varicose veins, but these are more specifically for runners.  They are not as tight as the nylon support hose type, but would definitely be warmer and are cute enough for visible wear.  I usually hide my support hose under pants.My calf is almost 15&#34; - at the very tops of the Medium recommendation.  The sizing seems true to the measurement chart. I got these during an introductory promotion but will be passing them on to a friend who is training for a marathon."
4.0,"They‚Äôre not made as well as I‚Äôd like but they sure are cute. Every time I wear them i am smiling too, so that‚Äôs enough if a reason to purchase."
4.0,Perfect under shirts and sweaters with leggings!!! It is a true long cami and stays in place. Does not ride up at all!!!
4.0,Is very beautiful and love the Scriptures is a especial unique piece for my prayers i love it thanks you
4.0,Cut of the back is not nearly as high as the product images make it seem.
4.0,"I love it with my wide comfy pants. I ordered the grey in a size larger than I would usuall wear. I am a small but ordered a medium. It is a big too snug and I could have went with large, but not so small to keep me from wearing it. Cute piece! I will order another in large soon. I am 5' 6&#34; 112lbs"
4.0,"the basic back-pack is good the only problem is /was the front zipper broke after 6 - 8 open and shuttings, this was very disappointing. hopefully I can get that repaired or replaced.<br />Other than that, plenty of room for Laptops, and other things, would be good for a couple of days hiking etc."
4.0,"While this is a cute little mask, the zipper doesn‚Äôt line up with my mouth, but rather my chin. Other than that it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs not tight and it doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin"
4.0,Fits a little weird but cute dress
4.0,"These are really great feeling. However, be aware the mesh is a little more revealing than I expected even after reading the reviews. I had bought to wear during summer kickball season but not sure I'll feel comfortable wearing these without some underwear that blends in well as the back side is all mesh and very visible."
4.0,I really like the dress...the top is a little to big but the rest of it fits perfect.  Great material.  Winter is the perfect season for this one
4.0,kiddo wont leave them on but they are still doign great when he bends them!
4.0,"Wrinkles easily, but pretty."
4.0,Love it hasn't chipped yet and still the same color
4.0,"I have trouble finding maxis because my chest is a medium but I'm short so the length of the medium is way too long. However this dress fits as expected. It's a bit long so I'd have to either wear heels or slightly hem it. The material is lightweight and airy, but not see through. I got a small. For reference, I'm a 32DD, 5'2, and 140 pounds"
4.0,"Very pretty, but the strands that go around the back of the neck do not want to lay flat. Making the necklace sometimes bunch up. Not a terrible issue, but just something to be mindful of. Clasp feels cheap-er so another spot to watch and be careful with."
4.0,Only if a case can be provided wid the glasses
4.0,"These  socks are very cute, if just a tad small for me.  They do stay on my feet very well,  They have added elastic at the top, and a lace accent that may not be noticed in the picture.  They are not soft as a chenille fabric, but are comfortable, and the price together was a value."
4.0,It is very comfortable but color is a little dull.
4.0,"Giving 4 stars because I ordered the navy dress with mustard, orange-ish and cream colored flowers, but I received the black with hot pink and green flowers. I did not return because the dress is comfortable and pretty and I needed it for an out of town trip the next day. I received many compliments when I wore it last weekend. I will be re-ordering in hopes of getting the correct color next time. I'll also be buying this dress for my mom, sister and cousin in a different print because they loved it so much. It does run big. Usually with Amazon you need to size up, but not with this dress. I'm 5'3&#34;, 145 pounds, B cup. I ordered a Medium. It fit perfect across the chest, but loose everywhere else - a small would fit better  I washed and dried in the dryer. It's still loose. I like that it has adjustable straps. It hung down a bit in the front showing the top triangle of my bra - easy fix with a quick slide of the strap :)"
4.0,The material at the attachment end is a little too wide which makes it hard to attach and then ensure that it won‚Äôt pop off. But super cute!
4.0,"Nice bag. I like the cotton canvas. It has just enough compartments to be very useful without being &#34;too much&#34;. Only thing I dont like is the cheaper liner fabric and the stitching on a spot near the top zipper has come a little unfrayed. Otherwise, I enjoy using it and I does a good job as an everyday &#34;work&#34; bag."
4.0,"Very cute and fun!  I think I could have sized down, but the fabric is a little clingy (so the medium was probably a good idea)."
4.0,They look great. I hate the way 99% of sunglasses purchased are shipped by Amazon. Always a crap-shoot if they arrive undamaged. You must be careful that the arms don't rest on the lenses... it's a problem.
4.0,hard to keep it over the shoulders as pictured
4.0,I like this hat...it's cool looking and fits great! Think it will keep my head from freezing...lol....it gets cold up here in ALASKA in the Dark Winter...just around the corner. Let the Snow fly..got my warm hat!
4.0,"I would love to say these markers are something new and different, but in reality they are just dry erase markers. Now, having said that, that doesn't mean I don't like them nor that they don't work well. As I have said many times, I am a wino, which means I drink A LOT of wine.  I often host wine tasting parties at my house. I find these markers to be a great asset to my wine tastings as no one is drinking out of the wrong glass and I really don't like wine glass charms. I think of these as grown up dry erase markers, no bright elementary colors just some nice subdue colors. The colors are nice, dark red, blue, green, silver and gold (more mustard yellow).  The silver shows up better on colored glasses then clear, but works just fine. When using, give the ink a good 10 seconds to dry before touching, it will smear easily.  Also, write the name or anything else up high on the glass toward the rim, because condensation will cause the ink to smear. If you are holding your wine glass by the stem, you should not have any problems, if you are using stemless wine glasses, having the writing near the rim of the glass should help with this issue. This set comes with a little, and I mean little cloth the wipe your glass clean.  I normally use my fingers and a kitchen towel as I wash all my wine glasses by hand.<br />I was offered a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review of the item. I try to only review items I will use in my everyday life so that I can offer useful feedback to someone trying to make their buying decision.  I like these markers, I bought these to replace another set that I had been using for the last few years."
4.0,I like them they're good looking Jockstrap but they would be perfect if they made the front area an actual pouch it holds you tight little too tight. My girlfriend loves them know even if I'm uncomfortable
4.0,Based on the photo which I know you can't always believe this sweater looked like it was sturdier.  I found this sweater to be a little clingy because it is a loose knit.  I thought it would hold it's shape a little better.  I also think it is a little long compared to the photo.  Pretty light color but don't expect it to look like the photo exactly.
4.0,"Nice wrap bracelet. Loved that it had a magnetic clasp, holds securely."
4.0,Cute. True to size. Legs could be longer. Im 5 ft 6 with a long torso. This was a tad short.
4.0,I thought it was going to be cheap looking considering the price but it isn't that bad.
4.0,"We have this on our back patio where we get direct evening sun and frequent strong winds.  So far, I am very happy with it.  It was super easy to assemble.  However, the only reason I do not give it five stars, is that it will tip over without a weighted base.  With the weighted base, it tolerates the wind very well.  And it's highly adjustable to block the sun as it gets low on the horizon."
4.0,Loved these only the color for Stone is Not at All like pictured. Zero green. Very brown and tan. Boring actually. And unworthy of the name Stone
4.0,"Kinda big , but really cute"
4.0,"I really like this beanie, very nice for the price.  My husband says it's stylish too, just a tiny big but I do also have a small head.  And it's totally fine until I bend over to get something then it covers my eyes but I can totally live with that."
4.0,"These sturdy jeans are well made. The fabric is soft, not stiff and exceptionally comfortable to wear. The fit is relaxed but not baggy. The legs are straight but not tight or extreme. The styling is classic with five pockets. The only thing I don't like about these jeans is the weathering. Machine weathering just looks fake and seems unnecessary. This defnitely looks faux. The stretchis enough to accomodate  full raange of motion without binding. Don't like the weathering but overall these re nice, true to size and well constructed."
4.0,definitely worth it<br />was able to recieve the colors i wanted as well
4.0,Great color. Great fabric. Fits as expected. Thick but stretchy material. Not as long as I thought it would be though. About 2 inches shorter than you‚Äôre imagining it.
4.0,"I have to disagree with other comments. The dress DOES run small and YES the manufacture needs to size up for items to be shipped to the USA .. please!  and they need to work on their dyes fading and the shrinkage ... BUT ... the dress is just as cute as it could be. The fabric is GAUZE so yes its a little thinner fabric but I have seen much worse selling in my fabric store lol .. If you are a true 3X, chances are this dress is going to be too small I wear 1-2X and I find is a tad snug across the chest and through the shoulders. I would buy it again."
4.0,"Very soft, plush, and comfy. A bit large at first...we'll see how much shrinkage after washing ;)"
4.0,The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because they leave deep imprints on your arm within minutes of wearing them. They‚Äôre super cute though and good quality.
4.0,The color variety is great. One pair has a loosened ear pierce. All of them move around more than usual.
4.0,"They are cute, a little smaller than pictured and the bite me inlay are slightly off set. This leaves a little ledge that can catch."
4.0,Love these shorts...great for summer workouts and kicking around
4.0,I love these pants but I ordered a LARGE and received an X-LARGE
4.0,"It's a nice size, zipper works well, love the wrist handle. It's a bit more &#34;synthetic&#34; than &#34;leather&#34; looking, but it's good for the price"
4.0,"If you're wanting something long enough to wear with leggings, then you need to go two sizes up. There are tons of comments that state this, so leaving a negative review and whining because it's not long enough is just ignorant.<br /><br />I love the lengt and feel. The only thing I don't like is that it's so thin, I'm going to have to wear a tank underneath, so that means going out and buying a color cordnating tank.<br />I'm 5'5 220. I normally wear a XL but ordered a 2xl and it fits lose and long."
4.0,"Really like these. At first I thought they might be too tall (they project outward quite a bit), but I think this makes them easier to see and gives them a certain style. They are very modern looking with the bezel setting and the way the stones are encased in metal. Definitely a presence on the ear. I changed out the backs to silicone disc backs, which do a great job of keeping the studs upright and tight against my ear. Love having the ability to change out the colors! This is a huge selling point. You must take care not to lose the little stones when you're not wearing them and keep them from scratching against each other (take them out of the bag and store them some other way). Overall very happy and would recommend these."
4.0,"It‚Äôs very thin, but with a nice blazer on top it does the job! It‚Äôs a little shorter than it looks in photo, but I‚Äôm 6 foot."
4.0,This is right out of the package dirty rusty stains and being a professional barber that is not a good look
4.0,"It's cute, but don't expect too much from this dress. It is inexpensive, so the material is not luxurious but it looks as pictured. The dress is one size fits most, SO if you have a full bust or are a little curvy it might be too tight. I found the fit tight, but it will work for what I need it for. I didn't find that the dress was too short but I'm only 5ft. If you're tall, you may need really opaque tights or leggings."
4.0,"Have had it for about a week and worn it a couple of times. Out of the box the straps are not too stiff. The color (depending on the lighting) goes from a deeper royal blue to a steel blue, which I do like. 4/5 Stars for having very skinny/thin spring bars (they do come w/ four which is good I guess) that are half the diameter of my stock spring bars. I would use my old beefy spring bars except they don't fit through the straps at the top, where they wrapped around the material pretty tightly so only skinnier spring bars would fit."
4.0,Super soft and comfortable. Runs a little big but satisfied
4.0,"Pretty dress, nice quality.  Lightweight enough for sticky, summer Florida weather.  Only problem for me is that is it sits a little to high above my natural waistline.  I am 5' 7' and 142 lbs.  Bought a large cuz I need room for my boobs in these knit dresses and that part fits perfect."
4.0,Product is nice and works well. I bought a size smaller and fits well.
4.0,So cute! A little tight but I'm sure they will stretch over time
4.0,I really like this sweater. I think it will need to be washed on gentle and air dried to prevent pilling but its soft and looks great so for the price worth the extra effort.
4.0,ITV is a really comfy soft hat and I wear it all the time
4.0,"Wanted it for a child. It's huge. The sizing chart is confusing. Luckily he wears it anyway, loves it!"
4.0,"So beautiful!  Love it!  Fits great.  It's my favorite color, and I love butterflies."
4.0,"These are nice, thicker weight yoga pants and the fit was as I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 142lbs, with heavier legs and the medium is a good fit. I can imagine that someone with thinner legs might want to size down.  The fabric has a bit more of a sheen than I prefer, but it‚Äôs not a huge deal, especially at the reasonable price."
4.0,I return them beautiful just a little to small.
4.0,Have two other colors! Love these hats. Probably will get more in future different colors.
4.0,"These ties are very nice ties! If you're looking for a paler yellow, these ties are not for you. They are a true lemon yellow. We ordered 3 or them, with the handkerchiefs and for the price, they're very nice! We're using them with a darker grey suit. The contrast of the two colors is very nice. My fianc√© loves them and says they're exactly what he wanted. I would have liked something a little less bright but as long as he's happy, then I'm okay with it. The fact that they have a paisley pattern on them make them look classier than just a plain yellow satin tie."
4.0,This is a well made costume however it‚Äôs kind of short in the torso. I sized up and it fit well but it‚Äôs not long enough. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 165 lbs
4.0,"Have not had the opportunity to wear them for a walk/run, but they fit and look great."
4.0,"I always have to order a size 1.5 sizes larger than her current shoe size. Nikes always run small, like most athletic shoes!"
4.0,After reading reviews I ordered a black hoping to get red and it worked! I also sized up to an xl when I usually would purchase a L. It fits nicely through the midsection but a little loose in the arms since it's an xl. It has a few loose strings and imperfections but nothing noticeable and for the price I'm happy! Love the red color and the front pockets- however you can't really use the front pockets for your hands unless you were to take stitching out because they are sewed partially shut. If this were higher priced I'd be disappointed but can't beat the price. I have not washed it yet so I can't comment on durability.
4.0,Top was a little small and looked weird.  I bought a different top from somewhere else and matched them together. Now it is adorable
4.0,"I have been anxious to come on and write this review for a couple of reasons.  One, I am super picky about purses and I wanted to be able to help someone else that might be in the same boat.  For me, a purse has to be attractive, functional and COMFORTABLE.  This purse almost has it all.  I loved the print/colors and functionality of the inside of the purse so much that I tried to talk myself into making it work and keeping it, even wondering if I could keep it for just certain occasions or whatever.  The material is awesome.  I love the thickness and the feel of it.  The print is rich looking, gorgeous colors.  The handles and backpack straps don't match the colors of the bag exactly but it all worked and I loved the appearance of this bag.  And the inside?  Great!  I loved the pockets and the little divider for the tablet or notebook (which is what I used it for).  I loved this bag and wanted to love the whole thing but .... sadly ... the straps SUCK!  You have this gorgeous little bag of perfection and then you put these cheap, thin, uncomfortable as heck straps on it and it becomes a deal breaker.  I had this baby all packed with my stuff and was so happy how perfectly it fit everything and how compact it was.  Then I put it on.  Boo!  First of all, the straps are &#34;adjustable&#34; but not really.  If you unsnap them to make them longer, which any teen or adult would have to do,  then the residual strap hangs down.  That's not the deal breaker though.  What IS the deal breaker is that once you get this beautiful thing packed, and not overpacked mind you, just packed to what it's made to hold, the straps can't handle the weight and they dig and sit uncomfortably on the body.  I have neck and shoulder issues from previous accidents and I was tweaked as soon as I put it on.  I figured, it's the end of the day, maybe try again tomorrow.  No dice.  So, to the makers of this bag, if you are listening.  You were THISCLOSE to making a perfect little bag.  Why did you scrimp on the straps?  If you had straps made from the same high quality of the rest of the bag, I would have bought three more in different prints because I otherwise love it that much.  Please note:  Don't cheap out on the straps!  People have to carry these things around.  I would rather have paid $5 or $10 more to have THE perfect bag.  Can you tell I'm frustrated?  It's so hard to find the perfect purse.  This one is light, great quality, totally functional, perfect pockets and exactly the right size for day to day use.  It's just those darn straps.  WHHHHYYYYYYYY?  lol"
4.0,"Great quality especially for the low price! The faux fur is fabulous, the quality, color and print are very expensive looking. They are very cute and made well. Mine were not adjustable however so they are a little big, But I still love them."
4.0,"The only negative is that if it gets twisted funny, I have had it fall off the clip."
4.0,It is a nice dress.
4.0,Very good fabric and feels comfortable
4.0,"I normally wear a 6. Ordered a 9; I was kinda hoping they would be loose and relaxed; instead, they are super tight and sexy, but not at all relaxed. Seriously, size up a LOT."
4.0,"Super cute, fun to wear around the house in winter."
4.0,"Love the style very nice, I‚Äôm<br />5‚Äô9 and it was a tad short. Overall a good buy<br />I would recommend buying a size up."
4.0,My son loves it. I think it is a little too big for his face but it works and we just pull it tight
4.0,"Read previous reviews, works fine, a little stiff even after working it, seems to be holding up though."
4.0,"Im big boned, so wrapping them more then 3 times around my wrist exposes the elastic cord, while only wrapping them 3 times leaves them to big, but i keep atleast one with me everywhere i go"
4.0,Good support and comfortable.
4.0,Super cute prints. The pockets kind of are bulgy. But that's because the material is a little thicker. I was a little surprised at how thick the material is. Which is fine for a warmer climate. It just makes the pockets lay a little weird and it doesn't flow like I expected it to. Other than that it is a great length and super cute fabric. This is for someone that is about five eight and a medium build.
4.0,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because based off of the other reviews and pictures I ordered a size that ended up being one size too small. Otherwise, it was super sexy and very well made. I will be ordering a larger size in blue üòâüëå"
4.0,"I really likes the quality and the design.<br />It just needs some improvements on the stitching, it shows under the pant"
4.0,Larger than I thought it would be but I love all the pockets
4.0,"The swimsuit is super cute!  My daughter LOVES it.  The only issue I have is that even though I ordered the size that my daughter is currently wearing (4T), it is a bit large on her (and my child is taller / bigger than most kids her age).  It is still usable and has room to grow, but I ordered this for her beach birthday party next month and wish it fit a little better.  Still happy with the purchase though."
4.0,"Nice color, but a little bit too large for me."
4.0,Solid deal.
4.0,"Very nice skirt but had to send back, because it was too tight in my hips for my taste. I would suggest ordering a size up. Very nice quality especially for the price, wish I could've made it work for me!"
4.0,Very cute earrings. Just a way to be on trend for now without spending a lot of money. These are a lot of fun to wear. I purchased in three colors. Not the highest quality but certainly good for the price.
4.0,"good detail, but very small."
4.0,It's a bit long for my Asian daughter who's 5 feet 2. But she pulls it up and it looks pretty cute.
4.0,sleeves slightly short but fits well
4.0,"Good, but it unraveled"
4.0,Nice quality dress but color is way off from the photo.  I ordered the pink color which to me looks like a heathered peach - the dress I received was almost neon coral.
4.0,A pretty pin that I gave my mother for Christmas. The clasp is small and was somewhat difficult for her to handle on her own (she's in her 80s).
4.0,"It is beautiful but it's taller then I thought it was going to be. The price was great, and I used it when I went on my trip so it did hold a lot of my items."
4.0,"Cute gift for grandson for the price. A bit on the small side for a water bottle, but it'll do!"
4.0,Was a gift and the 4 stars was due to the response I received when they opened the gift!!! They were very happy!
4.0,It's cute on for sure!
4.0,Very soft. Seems a little long.
4.0,"she put on the jumpsuit and said she initially put it on backwards but figured it out real quick. She loves the jumpsuit. She normally wears a medium but took a large in this, so read the sizing recommendations on the product page and go by that. It looks really cute when she had it on."
4.0,Maybe should of brought a bigger size but love the legging
4.0,Great for casual days. Super cute and matches with most bottoms. Keeps me very warm.
4.0,"Love the hat, but a little disappointed about the packaging.  The hat was in a plastic bag in a box that was obviously not handled well resulting in a few minor imperfections. All things considered the hat was delivered as expected, fit well if a little big, and looks great. Will be purchasing more Peter Grimm in the future."
4.0,"Nice shirt, heavier material than expected. Fits a little larger than expected."
4.0,"The fabric of this dress (black) is nice and thick. I am 5'4"" and it skims the floor. It fits great and I can't wait to wear it (it's been too cold here)."
4.0,The bag is huge!! It‚Äôs so perfect the design. I just wish the pockets were big enough to fit more than 1 bottle
4.0,"Great to wear with leggings, and nice and warm!"
4.0,"Beautiful color, great quality, and as pictured. It does fit a little on the big side but its a tunic!"
4.0,Got tons of compliments on it !  Wore it to school on Halloween - no costumes allowed so this was perfect !
4.0,thicker material then I expected. very nice.
4.0,"The fabric is very thin in a single layer, but it's quite nice and warm when doubled over and wrapped around you. It has a kind of funky smell to it, and the fringed edges don't have anything to keep them from completely unraveling (like a small zigzag sown where the fringe stops), so I am hesitant to wash it. I think it would be ruined in the wash. It's definitely not as high quality as a blanket scarf you would pay much more for, but it's an okay value for the price paid."
4.0,It's very cute but runs a little small. Got lots of compliments on it.
4.0,"I really like this dress.  Quality is pretty good, about what a had hoped. I'm 5'6&#34;, 159#s and I got an XL.  Fits pretty well.  Longer waisted than my very short torso, but adding a cute belt fixes the visual line.  Also fits my &#34;ample&#34; chest (36G).  Considering seeing the straps to the back as the halter isn't super comfortable.  But definitely works great for the casual dress I wanted it for."
4.0,"A little flimsy, but all in all, good deal for the price"
4.0,Feels great on my arm.  The only issue I have with it is the metal clips interfere with the compass.  I have to remove the band to get good bearings.
4.0,"They seem to work well, I have used them a couple of times.  I leave in Florida and would have preferred to choose my colors and get both sets white.  It is hot and sunny here.  They help protect my arms from my pointy plants, that is what I wanted."
4.0,I‚Äôll have to make my own headband because the one that comes with it is comically bad‚Ä¶but other than that it‚Äôll work.
4.0,The back does not have enough fabric so doesn't sit up at my waist.  I ordered two sizes bigger but just barely reaches my waist.  I am sending two pairs back that are my normal size but keeping the  bigger one.
4.0,"Better quality than expected. Estimated shipping date was to be three days prior to Christmas, they arrived a week after Christmas. Rendered useless for the intention in which they were purchased. Overall, decent product."
4.0,We needed face coverings as required by school and these are working well. They are comfortable and breathe well. Easy to wash and put up and down on the face. I wish it was two layers of fabric instead of one so that the inside also had the print and it was reversible.
4.0,"Cute, but real thin. Needs additional clothing underneath."
4.0,This will be very useful.  Just the right size.
4.0,"This dress is made of a thin cotton/poly blend, which in the blue print was not see through. It is cool and comfortable.  The floral was brighter than what is shown in the online photos. I am 5'10"" and 165 lbs.  I typically wear size medium or large. I ordered a large in this dress.  The dress fit well except there was a very slight pull under my armpits when I put my arms forward.  If I knew that the fabric wouldn't shrink, I wouldn't hesitate to keep this size.  My only complaint was that it fit more like an empire waist cut dress, not a lower waist as shown. I am tall, so clothing often rides higher if it's not a tall cut, but this wasn't even close. Due to the empire waist fit and the brightness of the print I am going to return it, but if you are smaller in stature, it has the potential to be a nice summer dress."
4.0,Do not like the fact that I cannot throw them in the dryer.
4.0,I love the swim suit. It's great quality but if you have broader shoulders and you're not part of the squat squad (I'm not) then the suit isn't for you.
4.0,"Received order and one glass was broken, had to reorder one glass to complete the set."
4.0,"Good vest, lots of pockets, mesh for hot weather.  My one complaint is that I saw so many reviews saying to order a larger size, that I ordered two sizes too large, ordered a XX when I normally wear a large.  So, the best is too large, but it  is my own fault."
4.0,"It would have been even better if the skirt material were shiny, but the lace is nice and it will be a nice summer frock."
4.0,"Cute, comfy & easy go to dress."
4.0,Super cute!  Kind of thin fabric though.  Not as sturdy as I would have expected.
4.0,Purchased for my daughter who loved it.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and about 150lb. I generally run right in between a medium and a large. Since I was concerned about working with my height, I went for the large. It fits great! It‚Äôs super cute and comfy. Four stars rather than five only because I think the material feels a bit on the rough side, to me."
4.0,"Obviously these are very cute - perfect for piggy lovers! When I got them they were $9.95 and I‚Äôd say they are about what you‚Äôd expect for that price. I will say that I think they are one size fits all because they are super tight and pretty thin and their are no tags/size markings anywhere in them, though the plastic bag they were enclosed in did have a sticker with a size notation. I‚Äôm 99% positive they are one size fits all. But yeah, like I said, they‚Äôre cute and worth the $9.95 I paid."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 165, DD I like my fall sweaters loose and comfy this fits just like the pic but I ordered up a XXL. I gave 4 stars not 5 for two reasons. It‚Äôs off white not white which is fine but product description say white so beware  secondly it smells like chemicals."
4.0,"Fast dekivery, great quality"
4.0,"These are super cute, very warm, and I got lots of compliments. But I wish they were lighter, very heavy for a toddler. Also, my guy kept falling in these so the day care didn't like him, he is on the clumsy side though in general with his feet....so may not be a problem for everyone."
4.0,Just elastic string but they look beautiful
4.0,I really like it but it's very small. I will be wearing it as a shirt not a dress!!
4.0,This product is a little big on me but is very sexy. I love it
4.0,"THIS DOUBLE LEATHER CASE IS VERY GOOD LOOKING, AND MY BIG SUNGLASSES AND READING GLASSES FIT EASILY.  IT FITS BETTER IN MY PURSE RATHER THAN HAVING TWO SEPARATE CASES."
4.0,Material was thinner then I expected but great with leggings
4.0,I received lots of compliments on this costume overall. The only negative is the Velcro on the back kept coming apart and I had to safety-pin it closed and wear a sweater.
4.0,My wife loved the color and feel of the material. The removable breast cups was a plus.  Unfortunately the sizing was smaller compared to like sports bras.
4.0,Love the colors. Fits on the small side.
4.0,If your looking for a variety of crystals this one is a good buy. These are genuine! I would have gave 5 stars but the silver tops are fake and not very pretty.
4.0,A little bit thicker than expected but fit ok.
4.0,Sits good on my body
4.0,"Great gift l, you pay for what you get"
4.0,I love these.  I've tried a lot of headbands and they didn't stay in my hair during a workout.
4.0,These shock are great and stay up well on their own
4.0,"Very Nice! I've used sterling silver up to this point and wasn't sure how my piercings would take to stainless, but they're just fine.  I like the style  - it's a thin gauge and looks great.  This style of clasp seems to be more comfortable if you sleep with the earrings in - other styles tend to poke.  Overall very happy with the look and value."
4.0,"Feels good, fits pretty well. I was kind of expecting the same jersey-type knot of othsr Nemidor dresses, but this is stretchy material that'll require ironing, which I loathe. Beautiful color, though! I'm eager to wear it this spring."
4.0,"Works, good thick (stiff) leather ends"
4.0,After having cataract surgery I needed glasses for reading.  These work very well.
4.0,"I really like this lounger for fall weather, and expect I'll love it come winter as the fabric is *quite* warm.  It's long and flowy, but I found the size to be 1 size too large.  I kept it knowing it will let me wear layers underneath in the winter without restricting movement."
4.0,Well my sons girlfriend loved them... his and hers... they are young 20's..
4.0,"Cute, comfortable & very warm. Exactly as pictured.  Would recommend."
4.0,"For what I paid, I am soooooo not gonna complain that the image was slightly off center. I thought it was cute enough to send one to a friend of mine.<br /><br />Seriously. For what is paid, it's a decent value."
4.0,"They're very nice sunglasses with a decent case. It's somewhat convenient to flip the sunglasses up when you don't need them, but I find they obstruct your vision a bit in the up position. I have large rectangular glasses, so these cover my glasses pretty well. I think they're a good value for the money."
4.0,My Kindergarten grandson had to dress as a favorite storybook character.  He wanted the Cat in the Hat.  I bought the toddler hat and these gloves.  We made a white front with a red bowtie to finish the costume.  He looked great and was very happy.
4.0,Fits a little big compared to the other dresses I bought with it in the same size. Still comfy and it has pockets!!!!
4.0,Runs large. Ordered a M stating it was 3-6 mos. and it is the size of at least 9 mos. clothes. I returned the M for a S hoping it will fit like a 3-6. It is super cute and good quality considering the price. Something comparable at Macy's or Kohl's would cost double.
4.0,I have a wider back and the material has no give .. it fits nice and of course I look great but if you do the hulk flex this thing will rip into at least 2 pieces .. I‚Äôm usually in between an xl to 2xl so it should have been roomy but I suggest a size up on this one
4.0,I was happy that it came earlier than expected. It's baggy with room for much layering even tho I'm size 10 with 28inch waist and 40 inches hip. I may have to choose size 8 next time for a true to size fit. I'm still looking forward tho to wearing in the next couple weeks in winter.
4.0,"I saw someone else used this as an adult for cosplay‚Ä¶ worked for me too! 5‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô woman and the XL came to my mid calf. Not the most amazing quality, but I just had to snip a few loose threads and it was good to go. Fabric is surprisingly soft too!"
4.0,Not as displayed in the photo however they are nice gauges will order again
4.0,I love this headband!  It matches any solid color I have in my closet & can be worn with virtually any color.  Being adjustable is a major plus with any headband since it accommodates any head size and will always fit comfortably.
4.0,"Good quality wallet, very spacious. Good price. No complaints."
4.0,Just upset cause it didnt come with the belt.
4.0,"Love the color, sparkle and size. Also, the top zipper works fine which is very important to me. Only gave 4 stars as I noticed some of the gold threads are in danger of coming loose. Fixed that with spraying clear FlexSeal, first on the bottom, to see if the color changes, and then sprayed lightly both sides of the bag. Looks good and solid. Haven't used the bag yet but am confident it will last."
4.0,"These necklaces are nice looking and large sized. They're very noticeable on an outfit, and really help to dress up any look. They look cheapish, not meant for evening wear, but look really good on an everyday/work outfit."
4.0,I liked the fact that it is all leather. It gets a little stiff between usage.
4.0,Beautiful but looks cheap
4.0,"Fits, but just a little tight, i wear a 7 3/4 har normally"
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my nephew and he loved it! Fabric is okay, good enough for a 3 year old boy."
4.0,My granddaughter loves them.  Wore them all day to school several times
4.0,"This is a great idea!  My fianc√©e gives me a hard time about me being a &#34;Big nerd&#34; for this, but it is great!  I wound all my cables and pop them on this.  I put all of my chargers (except my Surface charger) on it.  I put all of my various adapters on it.  It is so much easier to pull this out of my bag now than to blindly dive in and grab a handful of junk just to find a specific item.<br />The only complaint is the cardboard in it (I believe it to be cardboard that keeps it stiff) isn't stiff enough.  The board &#34;bows&#34; a bit.  I think going with a stiffer/thinker cardboard, or possibly rigid plastic, would be a little better to keep the shape.  But that a minor complaint; it doesn't appear to impact the functionality nor has it caused any sort of quality concerns."
4.0,"This hat is VERY nice for the price. I measure at 23 1/4&#34;, and the &#34;L/XL&#34; fits well."
4.0,Great suit. Nice colors. Covers everything. Daughter loves it
4.0,"These earrings are very nice, I just wish they were a bit larger for the price. I love the leverback feature that doesn't poke and has so far been functioning well - no lost earrings even though I sleep with them on. All in all, happy with the purchase."
4.0,The fabric is extremely thin but its cute for the cost. Wore it on vacation and loved it!
4.0,I really like this dress but as a 42C chest its constricting to &#34;the girls&#34; otherwise it is beautiful.
4.0,Very cute top. It has a nice fit. I like that the back of shirt is long enough to cover your rear.
4.0,"These are great pins, but the back comes off easily.  I lost one of them within a few hours of putting it on."
4.0,i dig these pants.  will be ordering again.
4.0,I wear a women's size 6 so I ordered a medium. It fits but it's snug but stretchy. I will return this one and order a Large. It's polyester and not too thick.  I will be sure to wear a girdle for a smooth tight look. I won't be wearing the sports bra with this dress.
4.0,They seem fairly easy to breathe through but I wish the ear loops could have been a little bigger. I have a rather large head. I do like the patterns.
4.0,"Super soft and light, exactly what I was looking for. Nice soft white, a rather deep blue, and a cheerful red that's not too bright.<br /><br />I was expecting a rectangle scarf, not an infinity scarf though... still serves it's purpose as a sunshade for my neck in the mountains fine ^^<br /><br />If I were so inclined, I would have no trouble picking the stitches holding to two ends together but it's fine as is.<br /><br />No strong weird smell like some have received, just a little plastic-y which will wash out easily."
4.0,Very nice colors I like it
4.0,"I love the color of these sunglasses, but I don't think the size of the frames looked right on me. I will try to wear them anyways"
4.0,It's a cute shirt but the arm holes look nothing like the model has on. Usually a medium sized but got large to get that baggy look like the model
4.0,Good for a family member's costume party. Will will wear it again come Halloween.
4.0,The material you can tell is cheap. Is what you pay for. A little transparent but is overall ok. Not a Friday or Saturday dress to go out but more like an office dress
4.0,I really dislike the logo in the left lense. If it was not there these would be some solid sunglasses they have the feeling of good quality sunglasses.
4.0,It is what mom wanted and she loved it as a gift. No complaints
4.0,They fit a touch small but other than that they are great pants. Very comfortable and lite wait they are great for the summer time.
4.0,Great lightweight jacket.  Goes practically anywhere and can be worn with just about anything.
4.0,They arrived on time and in original packaging. Only problem is that they run small. I wear a size 10 and they fit more like a 9. I would suggest going up at least one size.
4.0,the dress is pretty but runs small great for going out or going to a company party outlines the little curves i have.
4.0,"Nice vest ,good quality, runs a tad bit small though"
4.0,"The high waisted shorts are light and comfortable. I like the color, shape and style."
4.0,Favorite fit...not heavy
4.0,It was very pretty on and fit wonderful!!
4.0,"Nice pair of shades, Good quality"
4.0,"Good item, good price but it was somewhat large."
4.0,Washed and dried dress with no shrinkage. Colors have not faded yet either. Well worth the price.
4.0,I wore it on my cruise and it was so comfortable and cute. It‚Äôs pretty flattering in all body types due to the cut and style of this dress.
4.0,I only returned this dress because it did not fit me well.  But it is a good dress and the material was good.  It has some stretch but not a lot.
4.0,Product was as described.  Fast shipping. Strap is a little flimsy but overall good product.  Would recommend to friends.
4.0,"Cute shirt, but the arm holes weren't cut low enough for me so the fabric was kind of cutting into my underarm."
4.0,"Super cute and decent quality, it just runs small."
4.0,"I originally gave this product 2 stars because it is gigantic and not returnable unless you want to pay to send it back to China.  Anyway, I read another review that said a jeweler can make it smaller (I certainly couldn't).  It's true - for $10 - the jeweler removed 8 links and now it's perfect and looks great.  Can't give it 5 stars because of what it took to figure that out and the inability to size it yourself."
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received this product of the &#34;Glowing Glory Cross Glow in the Dark Necklace&#34; by: DM at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on personal se and are not in any way influenced by the seller. I used this to spice up my &#34;Naughty Little Angel&#34; costume for Halloween this year, and it was a BIG HIT!! These crosses are very small and I did have a hard time trying to get the inside to crack without damaging the crosses themselves. The glow wasn't to evenly distributed throughout the whole thing, but it still served its purpose of the glow when it was dark outside. I gave it a 4 star for the reason that it was the hit of the party, and the glow lasted about 7-8 hrs before it was done. Great little novelty for themes and fun, but not for safety when outside for long periods of time."
4.0,"I wear a size 6 and purchased a size 6, but they were a little big.  Should have ordered a 51/2, but still are cute and comfy."
4.0,Can get about a week use of them before holes start appearing. Which is about usual for these type of gloves. Pretty durable
4.0,Pedi s/m para un 6 de zapato !
4.0,"This key strap is great.  I loop it around my purse strap and flip it  INSIDE the purse with keys attached.  This way, I can always reel in the keys and all those annoying little loyalty cards attached quickly and with less fumbling.  Would like it to be about an inch longer, but it's good as it is--an extra inch would give it five stars."
4.0,Very Nice.  I am a medium and it Fits well.  Many of them are made too small and sold as ‚Äú1 size fits all‚Äù.  This is good while being priced fairly.  Thank yo to the vender
4.0,Looks nice but not really so rich as I excpected
4.0,too long for my 5'3&#34; frame
4.0,"Warm, stayed dry, and the vents are amazing. Step dad loves them. Just a tad smaller than I thought they'd be."
4.0,Soft mesh material throughout.  The hat is a bit too small for my head.  I have to max the adjustable hand to the largest size.  Very soft and comfortable.  The picture does not show it but the underside of the hat (under the brim) has a quote that says &#34;If it doesnt challenge you it won't change you&#34;
4.0,"It is cute, but not cropped at all. It actually was super long, I tied a little knot in it so it would be a little shorter. Also is a boatneck but doesn‚Äôt go off the shoulder at all. All in all it didn‚Äôt fit at all like the picture, but it is very soft and comfy so I still like it!"
4.0,Love the size and the design. Will use this as a head scarf.
4.0,My daughter loves her earrings. She wears them to church with certain outfits.
4.0,a LITTLE bit low cut to wear to church but they are comfy and pretty well made
4.0,"I live in the south. It gets hot here. I decided to take these puppies for a spin to pick up my kids from school.<br />Temperature: 88  degrees Farenheit. Boy, was it sweltering. I was sweating up a storm, but ya know what? My little sticky bra stayed put! I am quite impressed. I have yet to see if the ""stickiness"" wears off, but so far I am very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"Looks great on 2yr old.  Shorts are long, but my guy is a little short."
4.0,"Prescribed by post leg and ankle fusion surgical recovery physician. Provide enormous relief, far more than I expected. Attractive patterns, show them off to friends. One caution, are very tight and difficult to put on and take off, otherwise great."
4.0,Decent for the price......  But if you have a slim face these may be too big for you.
4.0,Good glasses for sun and glare. Great price.
4.0,nice and lots of colors. they seem a little bit smaller than the picture.
4.0,"Fits good, I have small hands"
4.0,Outfit was amazing. Fit as to be expected.
4.0,"I ordered the navy, beautiful color, great fit, except for the ""built in boobs"".<br />If you can't totally fill it out, you may want to reconsider...it's like wearing a bra that's too big, you can pull it off, it just doesn't form to your body."
4.0,"Got this for my wife since that damn tik tok song is playing non-stop in my house between my wife's and daughter's electronics. It was mainly a joke gift for her, but she liked it and it fit well (true to size). Personally I find the song offensive, but the chorus is catchy which is why it has spawned it's own dance. Regardless of content, the shirt is nice and the ""artwork"" is not some cheap iron-on patch."
4.0,I really enjoy those dress. I ordered my correct size and it looks great. I  grateful that the fabric is thicker than other similar sun dresses.
4.0,"It‚Äôs comfortable, easy to wear and the light blue actually matches and complements lots of my outfits."
4.0,I like the color and they are comfortable and warm. The only problem I have with them is that they are looser then I would like. I would have gone for a smaller size if one had been available.
4.0,Beautiful earrings!! I plant to wear these at my son's wedding. They are larger than I expected.  The crystals are beautifully clear and sparkle like diamonds!  My only complaint is that I wish they had a more stable backing. They come with standard earrings backs.
4.0,"This is a very fitted dress so I ordered small expecting it to be snug and it is but I don‚Äôt mind. Dress looks exactly like photos. Good quality & perfect for a costume I am creating. Very short so warning to mom‚Äôs whose daughter‚Äôs may want this, it definitely is short and fitted."
4.0,"Well the gloves were in good condition, no rips etc. I did notice that one glove was a little smaller than the other glove and the smaller glove surprisingly seemed to fit better. I don't know if I would recommend buying these. I think it would be better going to an actual store and looking for gloves like these, which I think I might do."
4.0,Very nice dress. A little longer that expected.
4.0,Fits great just to long
4.0,"I have a size 36 waist, and its almost too loose"
4.0,Sleeves seem a bit short but rest of garment fits well.  Wish it came out of the dryer with smoother look.  Otherwise I love it.
4.0,Uncomfortable material.... very itchy
4.0,"The sock itself is a little thin as far as the stitching goes, but the design is nice and it has good elasticity. Not perfect, but pretty good."
4.0,Apologies to the supplier ordered to by G shocks (Diff Suppliers) this was good and all delivery was fine.
4.0,"The Dawfold Beanie Hat and Scarf are very attractive and look great together.  The fit is prefect and cozy.  Each has an ultra-soft faux fur lining that is very warm.<br />I really like the pair and I plan to use them often each winter.  Regrettably, the hat has an imperfection in the weave, thus the 4 star rating.<br />I found this hat and scarf to be a great value at the listed price of $16.99."
4.0,"got this for my birthday vacation, to see how it looks on me go to @comfysunday on Instagram but my birthday is in like two weeks so ill have the post up then. The dress is nice the fabric is fine it does not snatch in your waist go shape your waist so I'm just going to tighten the backup or something so it's not like a block."
4.0,These are very bulky. I wore them today while plowing the driveway with my atv. Temperature was in the high teens. I found them to be cumbersome and more in the way. while operating the atv. I also couldn‚Äôt press the buttons on my garage door keypad.
4.0,"I really like this. The fabric is light and airy. The outfit itself is super cute. I don't like that there's  big bubble in the back. I'm 5'2 and 135 pounds. The sizing is a bit weird, but overall cute."
4.0,The lens chip easily.
4.0,Not a big fan of the style but I do love the color and the material. I gave it 4 stars because the only reason why I return it was because it was not flattering on me but I loved everything else about this!
4.0,"They are light weight. Bows are cute. Got them as a matching set for my two daughters. I would recommend them. They aren‚Äôt the best quality but they work well, but probably won‚Äôt last that long."
4.0,"OMG it feels like real hair! Also, its super long and reaches past my bum! But, you can totally see the wig lining thing under the bangs, unless you style it a certain way, or put some sort of headband on it. The color stays true to the picture. Its a bit heat resistant, though I do not suggest straightening it unless you are very careful. I cut it because it got so hard to maintain, but its pretty awesome XD"
4.0,A very attractive belt.  It holds very well.  My only gripe is that it is awkward and time consuming to buckle.  You have to thread the belt through one slot and take it back through an adjacent slot before cinching it up.
4.0,LOVE these sunglasses!! Very well made! I just wish they also came as sun readers so I could wear them when I am not wearing contacts as well!! Maybe  you will make those as well??
4.0,"Easy to put in and didn't cause infection. Comfortable, too."
4.0,Looks good and fits perfect.
4.0,"I loved everything except the size! It‚Äôs a little small, so I have to keep tugging it back down over my ears. I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt fit once my hair grows back. (I‚Äôve just finished up with 7 rounds of Chemo which caused all my hair to fall out)"
4.0,Fit like expected.  Good quality and thin for Spring.
4.0,"Love the earrings a lot. Only thing is I didn‚Äôt realize these weren‚Äôt sets of studs, it‚Äôs just four total, one of each size."
4.0,This is nice but large.
4.0,"Wow! These glasses are super nice! The quality is there! They are beautiful!<br />They sit comfortably on your face and truly help with fluorescent lighting! If you are sensitive to fluorescent like I am, these are a Must Have!!!"
4.0,These are really nicely made. For size you have to go off the waist they have listed and not the letter. They do shrink a little bit that is because they are cotton.
4.0,"cute top, a little small even though I ordered a bigger size, material is good."
4.0,"A little thicker than I would have liked, but nice."
4.0,Nice for the price. I like. Ring able to switch them up without paying a fortune.
4.0,"When I ordered this Nudwear Strapless Backless Bra, I did it knowing that I have a high failure rate with any bra that doesn't have straps and thus knew that it would likely not work out for me.  It is a really nifty design and if I was build just a bit differently, I think this thing would be AWESOME.  That being said, I can't give it 5 stars b/c I don't know for sure how well it works because my chest was too big for the C cup that I ordered.  I have always worn a 36C up until very recently when I let them size me at Victoria's Secret (yes, I know they don't really size you the way that you should be sized to determine your true bra size) and they said that I am actually a 34D.  I ordered the Nudwear in a C though since it seems to me that with strapless bras you sometimes have to go smaller if you are in between so that you don't have them too big.  I put this on and knew before hooking the clasp that it wasn't going to be for me.  I like a whole lot of lift in my bras (more than most strapless jobbies can handle)... I'm 36 and have nursed two kids, so they aren't quite as perky as they used to be!  Not Nudwear's fault....there is only so much that two little stick on cups can do for a person.  They do stick on VERY well!  I felt like they would stay in place all day.  They also do create a lot of cleavage depending on how you place them.  The C was just too small for me and I don't think that the D would be able to give me the support that I'm looking for.  This product would be absolutely fabulous for someone with a smaller chest than me though!  It comes in a nice storage case that is discreet and hard to protect the shape of the cups.  It is a great invention all together -- just made for a true size C cup or smaller."
4.0,It fits her good and looks good
4.0,This skirt was very comfortable looks nice on. I ordered a size up because I didn't want it skin tight.
4.0,I purchased this hat for the look of it and I'm so pleased that it's also very warm and soft.
4.0,Bigger than expected but I still really like it.
4.0,"These glasses come with a nice bag that fits well in my purse to keep the lenses from getting scratched.  They look nice, but do not feel like high quality glasses.  I expect they should last a while and will be fine as an extra pair of glasses."
4.0,Kinda loose at top and have to adjust but work good.
4.0,Beautiful necklace but the mini heart it comes with was disappointing since it looked like a cheap bead.
4.0,Very nice.  Small but as expected. Secure closing mechanism. You can hear it snap into place.
4.0,Just ok used in golf shoes
4.0,The recipient seemed very pleased
4.0,sewing was bad but workable
4.0,Fits sunglasses and regular glasses - one case instead of carrying two.
4.0,Looks great on my wife and she usually lies between a size 8 to 10
4.0,"not much to say really, they're key rings. they seem to be of good quality"
4.0,"This is a nice summer add on! The colors are great, and it fits fine..  It can be worn for almost any occasion.."
4.0,I had to get an xlarge because my breasts are 36DDD. Chest fit. I ended up hemming the sleeve length and I still need to hem the width of the skirt too bc it makes me look wider than I really am.
4.0,The pants fit perfect .
4.0,A little see through but still nice.
4.0,I liked them very pretty. I expected slightly bigger
4.0,A bit expensive but overall it was fine. Have only work once and havent washed it hence cant comment on material quality yet!
4.0,"Quality is good, color is vivid and doesn't fade after washing, just wish the two solid color shirts also have some cute prints."
4.0,I like this dress fits well
4.0,Very fun summer top I would recommend this top it's also sexy
4.0,Worked great for my second degree
4.0,a little short then I expected but they were okay
4.0,Great for 80s theme or hip hop party. Graffiti design made my outfit a success
4.0,So cute!! Though the pearl that closes it fell off after a couple of months but I fixed it easily by knotting the pearl on the string.
4.0,"This outfit was super cute, but it in no way fit my baby. The shirt fit well enough, but the dress was WAY too large. The straps were too long, yet the waist line and skirt length was just right. Definitely strange!<br /><br />Even so, we were able to criss cross the back and tuck the straps into the skirt. She wore this at Thanksgiving. She was 7 months, about 17lbs. We bought the size 6-12m. Got lots of compliments on her outfit. The quality was good, especially for the price. It didn‚Äôt take long to arrive. The only problem is the size range is too large!"
4.0,"I received 100 instead of 50, but one of them was missing a second ball. Haven't put them in yet since my piercing is still healing. Excited for the variety available to choose from!!"
4.0,"My daughter got this as a gift for her father.  He says he likes it except for the cord.  The cord doesn't allow the necklace to lay flat when he is wearing it.  He said he will be replacing the cord with another one, but other than that he likes it."
4.0,Really cute and soft. These gloves look just as pictured.
4.0,Slightly small but expected that. Awesome shirts.
4.0,They didn't work for me so I returned them.
4.0,Good cap. Could be a Lil better quality material but it's ok
4.0,Super cute!  Tons of complements.
4.0,"I also like it but quite disappointed to find it smaller than what it looked like when magnified.Overall,still looked great and high polished."
4.0,"I liked it, but husband thought it was too wide."
4.0,Love then but they have no traction. So can't wear them in the snow or i will fall.
4.0,"I like the look, they fit on me perfectly ( I am 5ft05 , 100lbs).<br />They're just not as warm as I expected. If you wear them in 30 ¬∞ F and above, you should be fine but I'm here with below 0¬∞ F, they just don't help much."
4.0,"I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô0 and pretty petite. Dress fits well, I like the length it‚Äôs good for going out or going to the office. Id say anyone with a bigger chest there could be an issue since the top cuts right in the middle of the chest area. All in all not bad"
4.0,quality of the pictures came out great for the price! this is a very nice gift
4.0,Love the shoes For the price i paid. Do wish shoes had some of the higher end lining that is meant for sneakers with heavy use and sweating as these things can be warm.
4.0,"I'm glad I got these they're great little cardigans that are really soft and cute also true to colour, I gave it 4 stars as I have to see how they hold up quality wise, but as they are I like them."
4.0,Great for how cheap it is. I would get another in the future.
4.0,"Love the colors. Lots of compliments. A little shorter than I like, but looks good with capris leggings."
4.0,"The watch arrived before its due date and looks exactly as shown.  Sadly, the back light did not illuminate the entire face and I couldn't see the numbers in dim light.  I bought this watch to use at night and couldn't.  I requested a refund via email and received a response in two days.  The company gave me a full refund.  I would do business with this company again in a heartbeat.  Thanks!"
4.0,Solo un poquito larga.
4.0,"Exactly what I expected - fit, print, color.  All good, cute shirt!"
4.0,"The color was beautiful and like the photo. However last year I bought a royal blue dress in a size M and it fit like glove but this one had a little bit of &#34;space&#34; in the middle and it fit looser so I had to keep pulling it down so it would sit over my bust and body frame nicely. Overall it was a nice dress, but I feel like a small would have been too tight so I played safe and got a size I'm used to. ** (I'm 5'7 and 176lbs hourglass/athletic build)"
4.0,Fits a little snug around the waist.  The quality is good too.  Not good if you your mid section is your problem area like me.  I will gift it.
4.0,Bought for my 12yo daughter who is 5'2&#34; and 95 lbs.  Fits perfectly.
4.0,Fits pretty darn good. A little loose in the top but over all quite flattering.
4.0,I really like this bag for my gym clothes and extras.  My only complaint is that the zippers sometime get stuck.  I like the separate compartment for my shoes.  I wear  9 in women and they fit without using up much space in the larger bag area.
4.0,There were ok for the price
4.0,"This towel wrap is made from a waffle style and while it is lightweight, it is not very absorbent.  The velcro closure is convenient,  but sewn a bit off so it doesn't close right in the front. The back is rouged which is nice,  and the pocket in the front comes in handy."
4.0,The dress is super cute. Fits loss and will be great in the summer
4.0,I love them but the bad thing is I have had them less than 24 hours there is already a run in it (like pantyhose) and a hole (not the thumb hole).
4.0,"Glasses are worth what you pay for them.  Only drawback I encountered was switching lens.  It‚Äôs s bit of a pain and by the time you get them in, the lenses are buggered up"
4.0,Very cute but they kind of dug in skin a little. I had to pry the ear cuff open wider for it to fit correctly; Otherwise cute.
4.0,I like this as it is narrower than the original band.
4.0,"Beautiful, but wowie is this thin! I didn‚Äôt realize just how thin. Haven‚Äôt worn it yet because I‚Äôm scared my kiddo will grab it.m- it will definitely break with very little force. Should have listened to the reviews that mentioned this. Pretty, though!"
4.0,I wear a small in women‚Äôs tshirts - this is superrrr cute and so comfy but it fits me like a men‚Äôs small.
4.0,"Description simply said the item is &#34;leather.&#34;  I took a chance; but was a bit disappointed to find it was not &#34;genuine leather.&#34;<br />Otherwise, it's a nice product that suits my wants & needs."
4.0,Beautiful ring beautifully made.
4.0,"So cute and flattering, but runs small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 128 lb, had to buy a large."
4.0,"Have to wait a little bit more to see the quality, but it is ok till now"
4.0,The fit was accurate as described and I loved the way the material flowed off my body.  Even though it is long sleeve the material is light. Definitely worth the purchase.
4.0,Nice product and my niece was very happy.
4.0,I love it but the fabric is much lighter than I thought. More of a shirt weight than a jacket. It arrived on time and was an easy transaction.
4.0,Pants were long !
4.0,Tad heavier n runs large nice jersey though
4.0,Added a t shirt to match my purse and shoes.
4.0,Ring came quickly.  Would have liked for it to be larger.  Only fits on husband's pinkie finger.
4.0,These are GREAT! They popped into my Oakley Frogskins easily. The color is awesome and the tint helps me a lot with cloudy days. The only thing that I didn't care for was how transparent it was in comparison to the original emerald iridium. I will still be ordering more!
4.0,Great price for western party at school. Fit my 6 year old fine and also fits me too.
4.0,Cute dress just like the picture. The material is really thin so i recommend this dress for summer time . It was a little large on my 18month old but it still looked cute.  I purchased it in a size 2t.
4.0,Just a nice tie. Have received many compliments for it. Bought it for a wedding and wear it often for work.
4.0,I love the dress i ordered size 14 base on the measurement i know i will have problem with bust cos my bust is 38. the bust was a bit loose so i adjusted the handle by myself and this make it fit perfectly. I guess the person that package the dress has a long nails i can see traces of nail scratch on the cloth hence 4 stars.
4.0,"The style of the vest was excellent, however for a slim fit vest it should have fit more snug, especially since we got the same size we generally use for a regular size vest."
4.0,"I ordered this in a small and it's too big.  The quality is alright, but I feel for sleep wear the cotton is also a bit stiff.  I've tried washing it a few times and it's still stiffer than I like to sleep in."
4.0,THIS WAS THE PIC I ORDERED FROM AND WHEN I GOT IT IT WAS A WAIST TIE.  I CALLED CS AND THE REP SAID I GOT WHAT I ORDERED THAT THIS PIC IS A WAIST TIE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THE SHOULD APRON.  ALL IN ALL MY FRIEND LOVES IT AND THATS ALL THAT MATTERS
4.0,"I'm not one to wear dresses with bows on the front, but I was looking for dresses that would be appropriate for business meetings and networking events. The dress can be worn without worrying that it would show too much skin. It's safe from that perspective, and can be used for multiple purposes. Pair this with some stockings if you'd like and your choice of heels!"
4.0,Great shirts except the arms are way too small.
4.0,"For the price it's a great dress. I don't believe it's the same dress as the picture, more like a knock off from the Stitch Fix dress, but it's cute. I love the fit. It is a little tighter in the bust if you are big chested. I'm a 34B and it fits well. The fabric says cotton and polyester, but it feels weird, sort of like a tent material. The lining underneath came with a rip in it."
4.0,"it's well made , has a good fit . Good solid USA flag"
4.0,"It fits true to size and I love the adjustable straps. It's a cami/silky cotton type of material and the details are so pretty. However, I had to return it because it fit my bust a bit weird. I'm a 38C and it looked great from the front but it gave me a side boob gap where the strap meets the lace and you could see my bra."
4.0,"Uncomfortable for long periods of time, but okay for a costume"
4.0,"Great for a cloudy day,and helps cut glare at night"
4.0,"Pretty but one broke already,I‚Äôm glad I purchased two."
4.0,"It's just like the picture shows, a plain sleeveless dress with pockets. The material is very light, pockets are awesome, and perfect with all sorts of sweaters or a denim jacket.  Only gave 4, because it didn't &#34;wow&#34; me...but I'll probably buy other colors.  Good price point for what you get."
4.0,"I love the hat- it‚Äôs adorable. My daughter is 6 months old and the 6-12 fits with room to grow.<br /><br />The cons- it has a tie strap for under their chins, not a breakaway.<br />It doesn‚Äôt have an adjustment to make the hat fit more snug. Looking back at the pictures I can see the color I ordered didn‚Äôt have a tie but the pictures are misleading if the hats are all different."
4.0,"I got this to go with another bracelet my 9 year old daughter recently got and the size is perfect for her, it‚Äôs cute and doesn‚Äôt look or feel like junk. I deducted one star for presentation because it came in a small baggie rather than any kind of gift or keepsake box."
4.0,"I ordered the black one and it is cute, but it had a snag with a small hole in it, which was disappointing.  Would have given it five stars if it didn't have the snag and hole."
4.0,"Looked really good on the website, looked like it's slim fit. But once it's arrived, I realized it's just regular fit and not at all like the pictures on the website. The tag on the bag also chaffs allot."
4.0,A little long but not bad. Fits good. Took around 2 months to receive them. I like the built in underwear option and comfortable.
4.0,It doesn't look as silky and fancy as the picture shows. I ordered a medium. I like my shirts not too tight so the size was good
4.0,"i had these in black and navy already - been very good.  this pair i ordered are at least an inch longer for some reason.  But, i'm hoping they shrink some after washing - will not return.  Waist fit as expected"
4.0,Very scary mask!
4.0,"This is beautiful and I love it, but it's already started to darken. Also it come to you super big so you will need to take out some of the chain and resize it to fit you. Not that big of a deal. I'd rather do that than it be too small."
4.0,"I rarely buy shoes online. Most of my life I believed I was a 10-11, now I'm starting to think I'm a 9.5. I ordered these in a 10 and they were slightly too big, but nothing that can't be dealt with. As wedges they're so comfortable and easy to walk in despite the height. The platform is just as thick as it looks. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"This is a fairly good product.  I have heard reviews stating that if you purchase this product, make sure you wear it 'only' for that event when you do it.  Well, I (try to) play basketball and I do this once or twice a week.  These shoes have great support on the ankle but as the other reviews have mentioned, it doesn't last too long if you use it for normal wear.  I've had these shoes for 3 months now and I'm starting to see the wear and tear, but so far not too bad of a shoe.  Just don't wear it for normal every day use, otherwise, within, I imagine, 3-4 months of wearing them, you may have to buy another pair."
4.0,Good for a dinosaur themed party.  Easy to write on.
4.0,They were WAY too long but I was easily able to use wire snips and cut them to the length I wanted & then file the edges. Very pretty to complete the look we were going for.
4.0,"Very comfortable. Light weight fabric. My wife ordered an xl just because she loves really loose pajama pants and she really should have ordered just a large. The bottom of the pants are very large. Almost like bell bottoms. Over all, Shes happy that she ordered them."
4.0,"Overall I am satisfied,but still I rather have ordered the leather band because its affects on skin."
4.0,They are lightweight. I like that.
4.0,"This dress is adorable! My only complaint is that it is too tight in the bust area. I ordered the biggest size (L/XL) and so I thought it would fit my 38D chest. I will try to fix it somehow because this dress is wonderful! Very cute, super light silky material, and perfect length."
4.0,This is a gift for a very hard working lady. I wanted her to know she is loved in spite of the BS she gets! I have yet to give them to her
4.0,Not very warm to wear in cold weather but looks nice
4.0,"For my Mom, didn't quite fit, but she did like the style and quality.  Just didn't want to order anymore."
4.0,I wore these while biking last winter. It does get to 0 degrees Fahrenheit for a number of days. I also wore them on a couple of slushy days. They do keep uu warm but they are not that windproof unless you are going slow.  The hips and butts are a little tight and the legs are very long. no proportional fit
4.0,So cute! Everyone said my son looked like the kid from up. :-)
4.0,"I ordered a medium and I'm 5'5&#34;, 148lbs and it was a tad big for my liking but I feel a small may have been too tight.  Overall it's ok.  It's a ribbed material and catches lint like crazy. I bought to layer with and for that purpose, it is perfect.  I may buy a non-ribbed version though."
4.0,"This top looks and feels like a bathing suit, but it more revealing than I expected - would probably suit smaller chests, unless that's the look you're going for. Threads snap easily, but ultimately this is a workable top."
4.0,Nice carvings
4.0,"The only reason it loses a star is that the straps will not stay up, no matter how tight or loose they are. This is annoying but manageable, the length is fantastic. I am generally an XL but sized up as other reviewers recommended and it is still quite form fitting, which is great for layering."
4.0,"I normally wear a 7.5 in women's shoes though I get them a bit wider than normal shoes. I got these boots in a size larger in hopes that a larger size would make up for it but my pinkie rubbed a little bit in the boots- I also could not wear these with socks on, I had to wear pantyhose to keep my feet comfortable [though I planned on wearing pantyhose anyways]. They're fairly comfortable as I wore them for two days straight without too much pain but I wouldn't suggest them for constant wear like I did. As many have said before- the sole did in fact come off the shoe but I was able to glue it back on with no trouble. All in all I would recommend these shoes to anyone who needs a pair of cute and comfortable but also sexy and sleek boots."
4.0,They are adorable. A little wider then I thought but still fit well.
4.0,Will take to have altered. (I‚Äôm petite...this is regular size.)
4.0,Great product<br />Just a little big for my elder mom and not enough elastic in band to hold it on her head but long enough to stay on throughout the night and the satin lining on the inside - just the touch to keep her hair in tacked.<br />Karena üòò
4.0,"Love this shirt! I paired it with pasties underneath and wore it at a festival. I would order a size or two up though if you want to be comfortable. I sized up and it still fit me like a crop, but it was a bit tight."
4.0,"Great design, quality seems pretty good. Just wish it was slightly longer and slightly wider. Great value for the money. I plan to buy more from this brand!"
4.0,"The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that the hat is firmly fixed to the headband, so it's not really adjustable without tearing the whole thing apart.  So if it sits wonky on your head, you're going to have to do a little &#34;cosmetic surgery&#34; to adjust the headband how you like it.  Other than that I thought it was great!  The headband is nice and sturdy, and the decorations on the hat are firmly attached.  If' you've got a big ol' melon head like me, this is a great option for a slightly larger fascinator that will be in proportion to the rest of you!  If you have a smaller head but you don't mind a hat with some presence, this is also a good option for you.  It's not dainty, and it definitely takes up some room, so be aware of that when ordering!  The mesh veil adjusts easily for the look you want.  Recommended."
4.0,"These small earrings provided my mother with just the hint of sparkle she wanted for a formal occasion.  They aren't for those times when you want bling, as the earrings are small and subtle.<br /><br />Build quality seemed very good considering the price point.  The stones were securely mounted and the clasp on the earrings held well.  Because of the earrings' size, they would not be suitable for people with hand problems, as they require some dexterity to put into the ear and snap the clasp shut.<br /><br />If you need just a subtle touch of sparkle, these earrings should work for you!"
4.0,"Everything was good except an earring was broken when I opened the package.  The wig was a little shorter than expected, and there was a lot more orange so I didn't use it."
4.0,Very pretty but it breaks easily.  All in all worth the money.
4.0,I liked the dress but it was too big for me and really long. I'm 5'6&#34; and don't usually have a problem with dresses being long. I returned to get a smaller size and hopefully it won't be too long. Other than that it seems like I will like it.
4.0,Really cute costume.  It's a bit small in the chest.  I am a 34 C or D
4.0,"I love that it has the RFID protection and plenty of room. However, being 5' 2&#34; it hangs down to my hip and bangs against it. A bit heavy for me as well."
4.0,Ordered a xxl but it doesn‚Äôt fit like the photo it fits like a regular sweater. Only oversized on sizes S-L if you order a size XXL
4.0,I don‚Äôt have a picture because I gave it to my mom but it came in very good condition very cute and stylish but you might want to buy a bigger chain
4.0,Very Nice ---However I think the beads are too large.  My Opinion only.
4.0,"They are cute and comfortable, not the greatest quality, but they will do for house slippers. The soles did start tearing away from the rest shortly after getting them"
4.0,"I love  this top and I actually wanted to order more in  other colors.  I was lucky to have read previous customers reviews and ordered the size (Medium) although I am a true (Small), I took their advice and it fit perfectly.<br />Love it."
4.0,"A great value for how many you get but unfortunately they‚Äôre in mm and I‚Äôm in America where all I can get it‚Äôs standard 1/2‚Äù and these are either a little smaller or larger depending on what mm you get. Only other complaint is the colors are very light; the reds are too light for my style, the black ones and grey ones are perfect but other than them the rest are all really light colored."
4.0,Pearls are bigger than expected
4.0,"This is the third Aussie Chiller hat I've bought.  First grey one finally wore out after over two years of very regular wear.  This one replaces it.  My only concern with this product is the manner in which it is packaged for shipping.  Seems the box is a bit too small and thus, the hat is crushed upon arrival.  Perhaps a bit taller box would be better.<br /><br />The good news is that you can't really damage these hats...it pops back into shape pretty well.  It's stylish, rugged and protects one from the sun."
4.0,"I like the design, but the length of the chain is too short."
4.0,"This is a very nice necklace for the person in your life that needs the help of the ""Patron of Hopeless Causes""!<br />The chain, although long, is all one piece. I might have preferred one with a clasp, but for the price, you can always purchase a different chain.<br />[[ASIN:B002M3GYR6 Sterling Silver 7/8"" Oval Engraved St. Jude, Patron of Hopeless Causes Medal on 24"" Chain]]"
4.0,This is super comfy! The fabric is really thick and soft! The pants were a little big but still comfortable!
4.0,The dress is disproportionate at the bottom.
4.0,This item is cute but comes unhooked regularly
4.0,Fine quailty not the best but not bad
4.0,A very nice shirt and soft too. The arms are kind of too long.
4.0,Fits a little smaller than expected and because there is no stretch to the fabric it's not as loose as I'd like.
4.0,I loved the shine of the baggetts and the cross is more like a charm than just hanging on a ring
4.0,Bought these for my husband.  He likes them but wishes they had more padding in the ear part.  He can feel the coil
4.0,Good looking top
4.0,Bought these for my grand daughter even though we followed the size chart and measured her foot still about a size too small
4.0,Reordered lasts a lot longer than most of the composite leather. This is not leather it is strong and resilient but finish gets damaged. Works for outdoor work cutting trees ect
4.0,"Classy and elegant, fits perfectly, a great buy"
4.0,Medium support. Fits nicely and washes well.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Light weight as well.
4.0,"Exactly what I expected it to be, Nice material that doesn't feel cheap. The white lacy part is a bit delicate but not to the point where you can't wear the suit comfortably. Definitely satisfied with my purchase. Its a bit tighter but thats expected of a one-piece swim suit. The front is cut down to right to the belly button area and has a nice open back."
4.0,Actually almost as good looking as the photo. Fur not quite as puffy but the fit & length & fabric was spot on. Mrs. Claus liked it alot.
4.0,"We ordered a size small for my large 17-month old (33"", 26 pounds). He was swimming in it, but the hood fit his large head. It's very soft and cute. The zipper is cheap and sticks easily, but overall we're happy with the purchase."
4.0,Love these pants so soft and comfortable with good pockets! Just wish I had bought a smaller size.
4.0,I am very satisfied with the keychain.  It came in a nice box and velvet protector.  It looks just like it does in the photo and is holding up well considering I drop my keys often.  I would recommend this product to others.
4.0,cardigan got 4 stars because it looks nice but be aware it is very thin so if you‚Äôre looking for a sweater that is going to keep you warm this is not it and green and red are Bright.
4.0,Got the purse to match my fringe boots.  Love purse very roomy
4.0,Just wish it had a leather strap. Other than that more than what I expected!
4.0,"When I first put these on I wasn't sure I would actually like them because they do fit like tights. They are really comfortable and not see through at all!<br />The only reason I did not give them a full 5 stars is because the waist rolls down when doing sit ups or other high intesity workouts, but they stay in place when walking or running."
4.0,It arrived on time and fit wonderfully!
4.0,Decent product. Dries really well
4.0,"Screws are a little small for my old eyes and fumbling hands, but been using it for months, its holding up and looks good."
4.0,"This bra runs small, too small. But beautiful!"
4.0,I really like this necklace. It went perfectly with my voodoo queen costume for Halloween. I was very surprised how well it was put together for the price.
4.0,"The pajamas were lovely.  However, they were cotton knit.  Knit material tends to hold the heat as opposed to plain cotton material.  At this time it is difficult to find a pair of pajamas made of just plain cotton which allows air through better.  So, I sent the pajamas back."
4.0,very flexsible
4.0,Very happy with size and quality!
4.0,"Good amount of fill, soft and has a slightly shiny finish. Fits men's ML"
4.0,WORK VERY NICE
4.0,Love the aesthetics but material too thin. Have to wear 3-ply surgical mask beneath.
4.0,"I ordered a medium, 5'9 145lbs. It fit well, except the back. It was too tight or something, the material seemed super stretched. Returning and ordering a large."
4.0,Of all the LE blue-line masks I have seen I love this graphic the best.  he fit of the mask however is not great. There is a nose piece that is great and it prevents you from wearing it upside down but the bottom is floppy. When you tighten the ear loops to try and make the bottom more snug it is WAY too tight across the top of your face.
4.0,"Simply lovely, does not look fragil or like bad costume jewellery.  It sparkles!"
4.0,I love this top!!  Perfect top for summer.  Can dress down with shorts and flip flops or ps with a skort and wedge sandals!!!
4.0,"I like this cardigan because it is made of a light and stretchy material that drapes nicely. The sleeves are snug but have that spandex stretch which I like because I prefer to push my sleeves up to my elbows while I'm working. I push them up and they stay there. It is very comfortable and is perfect to layer over blouses and tailored shirts to ward off the a/c chill in summer and still not be too warm when the heat comes on in late fall. Because of the material, it lends itself to a slightly more dressy look than a heavy knit topper so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable wearing it out to dinner or an occasion that calls for less casual attire. I recommend washing it on hand wash/delicate setting, cold water and let it hang dry."
4.0,I use these to cover up my tattoo sleeves because I work at a Hospital. Serve their purpose excellently. My only complaint is they don't seem super durable. I have several pairs that I rotate every week or so and there are several that are already getting holes in them just from normal wear.
4.0,"This really saved me. I had a Halloween party to go to, but no costume. I ordered these and it got to my house just in time. The headband earrings, bow tie, and tail, really made my costume look wonderful!!!"
4.0,"Ordered 5 bags, the shipping was quick, packing would need work if shipping time were longer. Everything arrived in expected condition.<br /><br />  Have panned half the total material by classification and found an Average of 0.43 grams of gold per bag from the above 30 mesh range. Will run the rest in another day or so.<br /><br />  All material ran, no additional findings. The mix of gold, silver, and platinum is hard to discern and harder to separate. Do yourself a favor and buy one or the other, but, not a mix like this."
4.0,If you have big breast it will not fit besides that the outfit is amazing. The outfit looks just like the picture. It is two pieces. However if you are too heavy don't waste your time.
4.0,"I was looking for a comfortable but formal  dress that could handle being packed away for traveling.  The fabric didn't wrinkle on it's 4 hour flight to Vegas.  I loved the style of this dress with the really cute train.  I would have preferred a more forgiving stretchy and soft (Jersey Knit) fabric buuuuut this dress came through, especially for the price.  There was some concern with how the underarm area fit but I wore a shrug with the dress so it wasn't that noticeable. After adding accessories and a stylish heel this dressed performed well.<br />Fit was good, length was great, fabric was ok-with some additional accessories everything pulled together nicely."
4.0,Very pleased with the quality of the jacket and the transaction.
4.0,She seems to like it. Nice 3d look
4.0,"I'm 5'2"", 135#. I purchased a size small. This dress fit like a glove! The sleeves were a little snug as the lace has little to no stretch, otherwise it was extremely comfortable. For the price, it was an excellent buy. I purchased it last minute for a last minute event and couldn't have been more pleased. I received multiple compliments and people couldn't believe this dress was purchased from Amazon!"
4.0,I liked these earrings. They match a Sterling Silver Heart ring I‚Äôm currently wearing.  Yet they irritated my ears a great deal . They are also thick & hurt my ears considerably while trying to sleep in them.<br />I quickly returned them . They are a nice size but just too thick.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt take pics of my mistakes
4.0,"I bought this for my security crazy friend.  When it arrived in a bubble wrapped bag I was expecting something different.  It was just a thin piece of plastic.  It was hard to wrap since there was nothing to it.  I can't say for sure that it has prevented her RFID info being compromised, but I can say it is still intact.<br /><br />6 months after she put it in her purse it is still in good shape.  The edges are a bit frayed from rubbing on her wallet, but the important section is still in great shape."
4.0,good compression - a bit difficult to get on with only onr operablr hand
4.0,"Is super light, so far is what I expected. I don't give it a 5 because I don't know if it will hold up during my upcoming trips."
4.0,Great hat def what I was looking for
4.0,it was stunning with my outfit but it seems its loosing its color
4.0,Around the house . Comfortable
4.0,It fit great! The only downfall was the colors on the belt peeled off a little before I even got to put it on.
4.0,"I liked the material and pattern so much but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt fit me. The waist was a bit too big for me and it seemed to be too high up as well, but but the length was perfect (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and it was an inch or two above my knees). Luckily they gave me a refund and it was processed super quickly."
4.0,after several washes the collars start to get a little deformed
4.0,4 star only because it wasn't wrinkle resistant. It looked very nice on my teenage daughter. I will buy more of this brand in the future.
4.0,Jacket was excellent - nice lining
4.0,It did fit shorter on me than I expected but all in all it's super adorable and something nice to wear if you're going to a concert!
4.0,"Just came in. Arms fit great, the shirt feels good, only problem it's to big. Would retry again in medium"
4.0,"It‚Äôs really cute but not meant for people with large chest since the top is short. But other than that, love the soft texture and quality for the price!"
4.0,Fist a adult great
4.0,I lose earrings A LOT!!!! These aren‚Äôt the best quality (primarily the backs are complete crap) but as I don‚Äôt really care about keeping them too long they are great so I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing them as they are so dang cheap. Pretty cute too!!! Also if you like a pair a lot just use your own nicer backs and they are perfect!
4.0,Happy with the bands.  The material is great and the clasp adjusts easily and holds tight.  The mint and white are perfect as shown.  The &#34;gray&#34; is more of an off white/taupe color.  Not exactly what I was hoping more but still too nice to return.
4.0,Items look like the ones in the picture. Quick arrival time after the order.
4.0,"I'm athletic and have muscular thighs and I couldn't pull these all the way up to my thighs, the top was constricting my leg too much. I just pulled them up to around my knee and they worked fine!"
4.0,"I am 5"" 5"" and 174 lbs. I ordered the XL and fit great everywhere except for the bust. I Am a 40 D.. super tight there.  Material is nice, collar is beautiful.. I"
4.0,Mine came with a hole in it. The seam wasn‚Äôt sewn correctly. :(<br /><br />*update The company contacted me and completely took care of the problem. Very impressed. Only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because the fabric is a little too thin.
4.0,It‚Äôs very cut but it‚Äôs small so I send it back
4.0,"These are super warm. I like them a lot. They were my first purchase for myself in a long time and they are so comfy. The only reason they are getting 4 starts instead of 5 is that the yarn is pilling very quickly. I think the neat knit pattern is almost undetectable now. I am sure if you wore these with the intent of not using your hands all that much, they would be fine for longer, but I bus, have velcro on my rain slicker, and and just in general kinda mean to gloves. Even when they are starting to pill, they are a gorgeous color and still super warm. You can even fold down the thumbs to be able to use your thumbs if you have short thumbs (like I do). I am so happy with the purchase - I want to get a hat from this same company."
4.0,You can tell they are polarized. Light plastic frames that are perfect cat eye size that isn't too big on the face. Sometimes it can be difficult to see phone screen because of how dark they are.
4.0,"I used to wear a size 7 medium in pointe shoes.<br />But apparently your feet just keep on growing, especially if you stop practicing for a couple years.<br />These seem like fairly nice shoes.  But I can't wear them.<br />Would buy again.<br />But in a larger size."
4.0,Pocket seem came apart.
4.0,"It's comfortable and doesn't get caught on clothing or linens.  I wear it ""24/7"", even in the shower and at the gym. I plan to get a gold one just like it, if I get a Christmas bonus this year!<br />:)"
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered one size larger (5T for my almost 4 year old daughter)<br />This size fits her perfectly (she usually wears 3T/4T)"
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but the second necklace gets stuck on the other 2 and leaves a tangled mess
4.0,"Me encantaron los lentes. Me fascina el color. Mi √∫nica queja es con relaci√≥n al estuche. Es solo una bolsita negra, muy fea para la calidad de los lentes. Pienso que le resta mucho a la  presentaci√≥n."
4.0,"really a great summer dress, comfortable and simple"
4.0,"4 stars because one size fits most did not fit, however the coverup is absolutely beautiful...well made and light. Colors are very nice too...not going to return but give away."
4.0,"Straps are just a little off on each side. But cute, flowy and great for price."
4.0,Smelled like heavy cigarette smoke on arrival. Seems pretty sturdy from the outside but after a few months it is starting to tear from the inside pockets. I'll still give it 4 stars for the amount of pockets and usability.
4.0,these are a little larger than what i would typically find at other retailers in this size (6-12 month) so size down!  but they are super simple and exactly what i was looking for otherwise.
4.0,Very cute but headband sits loosely on head. Doesn't feel very secure and wouldn't wear it outside when windy.
4.0,Good fit nice shirt sent right away
4.0,"This band has 100% market share in the ""fitbit luxe velcro wrist band"" market, but that's because its the only seller in that market, lol.  But as soon as someone designs a band 2.0 with a slightly larger rectangular bracket (or just a longer band), that new band 2.0 will take over.  That's because this current band is too difficult to take on and off if you have a larger wrist.  Having a larger wrist, I can't get it off without unclasping it then allowing the entire length of the band, including the velcro part, to thread underneath the square bracket shown in the pic.  But it only goes through that bracket with great difficulty and it takes a minute to force it through.  If the band were longer (so the velcro would not need to go through the bracket at all to take the watch off your wrist), or if that bracket were a bit larger, this band would be just right."
4.0,"Thought these slides would be good to putter around the house in.  I'm diabetic so have to be careful what I put on my feet.  The upper strap irritated the top of my foot, and the quilted looking sole is not as comfortable as hoped.  They did fit well and are sturdy;  just not for me."
4.0,"It got the job done, and easy to use."
4.0,I love them! Their a little smaller then I expected but its actually a pro because their really not heavy. They turned green a bit around the base but that's to be expected for the price. But hey! I love them
4.0,Small but still cute.
4.0,Excellent cap. The wool is a plus and keeps you warm.
4.0,"This is a beautiful coat for sure. It is, as several of the other reviews say, a bit on the small side. My lady usually wears a size large. I got the XXL size and it could actually be one more size larger for her. but It is still a great coat for the price."
4.0,Great Bracelet.. Nice quality and a great fit..
4.0,"Easily the most comfortable flip flops I've ever owned. However, I've worn them maybe 15 times and the edges of the sole are starting to show some wear - it hasn't affected anything yet, I just wonder about the long-term durability of them."
4.0,"I was afraid these shirts would be too tight, but it was nicely fitting. I am 5 ft, 102 lbs and a size small fits just right. I will say, if I feel bloated that day, these are not the shirts to wear lol other than that, I really like them!"
4.0,"Great PJ's.  They look good and feel soft.  My only issue is that the pants are too long for short girls (5'4"").  I had to hem them up a little bit but still love them!"
4.0,"Good quality, the sports bra is super cute but has no stretch whatsoever. I‚Äôm normally a small and ordered a medium, but still struggled to put it on, once on it fits very nice just no stretch. I would definitely size up."
4.0,It's thin but it can be worn in the summer for sure. I think it would be great as a beach cover up!
4.0,Like the pineapple charm but thought it would be a little bigger
4.0,"I loved the size, the color and the material."
4.0,"These pants are a good deal for the money. They have a more generic fit, which Ive come to expect from some cold weather or wet weather gear. They're a little on the snug side so one size up may be a little more comfortable."
4.0,Great quality and the style looks pretty good as well. This bag is tiny so make sure to know the dimensions before buying so you don‚Äôt end up like me. The compartment for the camera is so small it won‚Äôt fir my Sony A7iii w/ the vertical battery grip + the sigma 20mm. I‚Äôm returning it to buy the Dalson version.
4.0,Just what we expected.<br />I know it‚Äôs intended to be a random assortment had hoped for some other patterns but still it‚Äôs made my little one very happy.
4.0,Look good not too fancy ..Wish they would have been a little shinier. Almost a dull metal look !
4.0,"I am only 5' tall so I thought I'd have some length to work with here. Still goes up dangerously high. If I stood still in this and didn't move it would be fine, but the second I move or dance I am *exposed.* So I'm returning it. It still gets 4 stars because it is decent quality and it came as described, I should have known better!"
4.0,Little baggier than I expected but I wouldn't call it a flaw. Those go really well with beige/apricot color tops and quality is really nice.
4.0,I wanted a undershirt that was large enough since I am a big guy and this fits the bill.. For those who wear a 4-6x shirt this will work well for a undershirt. Its light enough to wear under a shirt or wear it around the house by itself. Its long to where it tucks in well and not ride up your gut. I will buy more when more money comes in. 2 per pack that it comes in..
4.0,I like the wire fasteners - We just got them but they look like they will hold up to the rough treatment that baggage handlers put our luggage through. The only draw back was screwing the two pieces together - the fasteners are very small and might be hard for some people. I didn't have a problem but some people might...
4.0,it is longer than I expected. But it's a very nice fabric and it fits well.
4.0,"We bought these as a small gift for my son's 5th grade teacher who loves Xmen.  He really enjoyed receiving them!  The quality was not amazing but was decent, not too thin or thick, and the sizing was accurate."
4.0,comprar√≠a mas es muy c√≥modo
4.0,"Cute and flattering! Buttons are just a bit loose and its a bit short (definitely cant even partially bend over without giving a show). Im 100lbs and 4‚Äô11 and typically wear smalls, I purchased the medium and its a bit snug and I probably could‚Äôve gone up another size without issue"
4.0,"I love this bag, it is very durable and carries everything I need when I'm commuting to the city with the exception of a laptop. But this would definitely fit a tablet or ereader."
4.0,"Good for the price. I like Fabletics much better, but these are the ones I wear for real gross and sweaty workouts. lol, they do the job."
4.0,I bought the biggest size. thinking it would be too small but its too big. Because it stretches so make sure you go by the size chart. It's also very comfortable. Oh one lady on here said it ripped when she wore it that means it's too small.
4.0,I love the outside of this jacket! It‚Äôs super soft not itchy at all! The only thing I wish was different was the material inside. It‚Äôs not itchy but not as cozy and warm as the outside. Still a great piece to have in your closet to top off your layers!
4.0,"I really like this pair of sandals.  Inexpensive pair, well worth the money for the quality. Pretty light weight."
4.0,"Some of the reviews of this Ocean Band are pretty harsh.  For those curious, the band is nearly an exact replica in size to the official Apple Watch Ocean Band (the official Apple band is in yellow in my pictures, the white one is this Fulsaxad purchase).  The rubber is definitely not as rugged as the official band, but it doesn‚Äôt seem particularly weak.  I wouldn‚Äôt trust it for diving, but for everyday use, it seems like it will hold up just fine.<br /><br />My biggest appreciations are the buckle and loop sizes.  On a number of other replica Ocean Bands that I purchased, the buckles and loops are sized too large, which makes the band susceptible to falling off because the rubber doesn‚Äôt tuck in tightly.  Very annoying and I‚Äôve returned a number of other bands for this reason.<br /><br />But, this band, while clearly not sporting a titanium buckle and loop, has the metal bits sized just as tightly as the official Apple Watch Ocean Band, which I tremendously appreciate and makes me feel secure wearing it.  It‚Äôs probably still overpriced at $25, but it‚Äôs definitely a much better value than the official band and is perfectly suitable for everyday use."
4.0,"Ordered the same size in black but this one was smaller and therefore tighter. I get compliments on the shirt, just wish it was a little more loose. Can be a little warm but fine with me wearing it in the tropics all the time because its going to be +85F all the time."
4.0,"The details on this pendant makes it look unique and beautiful. When I put it on, the pendant sat at exactly the right spot; at the top of my chest. It was also so lite in weight that I didn't really feel like I was wearing a necklace at all. The color of the silver looks to be genuine, but when I touched it, the necklace felt a bit flimsy like it could break pretty easy though."
4.0,"I purchased this hat for a trip to Tuscany Italy in July. I packed in my checked luggage and it popped back in to shape. It has also been stuffed in my day pack, without damage. I have worn it daily for two weeks at temps in the high 90‚Äôs.. The hat provides good shade, but the airflow could be a little better. I have received compliments on the hat almost daily from fellow travelers, guides, and family."
4.0,"Was skeptical myself, but softest pair of anything i own. Breathable but warm probably would recommend dark colors only, semi transparent up next to your face. I'm going to buy the shirts and long pants. Great purchase, get them while you can"
4.0,I like the support that this bra gives.  The only thing that bothers me is the seems on the bra.  They show<br />through.  Wish they could have made this seamless.
4.0,Very helpful in helping you identify which suitcases/bags are &#34;yours&#34; amid a sea of others circling around the baggage claim.
4.0,Over all its a good package. Should last a long time with multiple choices and styles.
4.0,"This item was a good fit. Very soft material.  The only complaint i have is that it is almost see through, so you'll have to either go sans unders or find a good nude panty."
4.0,"I could have probably gone with a smaller size. I‚Äôm normally a medium but I ordered up to be safe. Still fits relatively well. I‚Äôve received lots of compliments. Sheer, would recommend a tank underneath."
4.0,I love this bag. Has lots of pockets and room for all a lady needs. I am happy with it.
4.0,This shirt would possibly have been a hit if I had purchased a light colored or bright colored t-shirt vs. black t-shirt.  The dark background didn't work well against the part of the shirt with Lionel.  Fred however looked great on either color.
4.0,These are easy to use and a great value for the money. They seem ling enough for an adult and can be put further on the ear pieces for a child.
4.0,Love this top and I will be ordering more! The material feels great and can be worn casually or dress it up. I only gave this short 4 stars because you have to be careful when washing it. I washed on gentle cycle
4.0,"So much more flattering than expected. Great material. I did rip the stitching in the armpit the first time I put it on, but I went and got it fixed. I love the shirt."
4.0,"I like, but came out of box with a weird plastic smell.  Hoping that goes away after a while."
4.0,"Is what I expected. A cool, snug fitting cap with nicely curved bill to wear on warm days.<br />Has good air flow and protects my eyes. Not crazy about the badging, but I don't have to look at it while wearing it."
4.0,"My wife says it fits well, is very comfortable, and she loves the pockets. But she says it‚Äôs too long."
4.0,Purchased for granddaughter.  Fits great.
4.0,"Drfinetly true to size. If you like a roomier fit , size up"
4.0,"I really like this bracelet and I get a lot of compliments. The only thing, if you wear it too much (which I do), the strings start to wear out and stretch to the point that you will need to replace it a bit too soon."
4.0,A little bright in color but over all good
4.0,Good value for the price.  Cheaper than Keen's!
4.0,"Yo soy de una altura de 5,4 y peso 146 libras, e pantalon me quedo justo a la medida, tiene una tela muy fresca, solo que cuando me lonpondo parece que la parte de la cintura se va a romper. Lobde para correr y no me caus√≥ ning√∫n problema"
4.0,"I love the 3/4 sleeves and the lightweight material that is great for layering in spring and summer. The material is thin, soft, and comfy. Unfortunately, the ‚Äúcoral‚Äù color is a pink not orange as the picture looked. I double checked the packaging worried I‚Äôd ordered the wrong color. It‚Äôs also longer than I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and the long parts of the very front go down to my knees. It‚Äôs still beautiful and great for this time of the year."
4.0,"Great leggings , good quality but thinner fabric than expected"
4.0,"Somewhat small bought for my wife, but was able to give to my daughter."
4.0,"Cute comfy sweater, not exactly as shown, but very similar.  Shorter in length and thin material. Excellent customer service."
4.0,"Bought these for my 3 helix piercings. I just got them but overall the quality seems decent. I do wish the rainbow colors were a little more vibrant but considering the price I'm not disappointed. I will update later if they do not hold the color well with showering. The rings are a little larger than I would have liked but my ears are also on the smaller side. As long as the color holds well I plan on purchasing more when I continue piercing.<br /><br />Update: color seemed to hold, however I would not recommend these for daily continued wear. They are comfortable but the metal ball that closes them comes off easily and gets lost. Have since had to buy ones that close together."
4.0,It's so nice and just a great ring and a good price. I think if your looking to purchase a ring this one is the one so nice and elegant I highly recommend .
4.0,I got exactly what I was expecting. It looks just like the original band loop that broke. Feels good to finally be able to where my old watch.
4.0,"I was attracted to the rectangular shape of these dangle earrings, they are slimming to the face and different from anything I own. They are thinner and lighter than I expected and while the ear wires are clearly stamped 925, the rectangular drops are not. They move quite nicely and catch the light. These would make a great gift for anyone with pierced ears because they probably have nothing else like this in their jewelry box. These will get tucked into my daughters Easter basket. They will be a nice non-candy treat and will fit perfectly in a plastic Easter egg! These are packaged in a pretty paper envelope inside a zip top bag and come with a little square of polishing cloth. All in all, these would be a great addition to anyone's earring collection!"
4.0,Ended getting from someone else so returned the items.
4.0,"It's light and cool.  Hope it wouldn't dry so fast after I soaked it on a hot day.<br />When it's still wet, it really helps to beat the heat."
4.0,"nice but material is to thin,if you wear panties,- girdles,then its not for you.any undergarment will show if yours is this exact blue and white.  The blue color is very pretty."
4.0,Beautiful and great fit. This has a heaviness when worn for work. This is great for going out as it looks beautiful
4.0,"order true size, it's a little big, but great otherwise"
4.0,Nice wallet. The added protection is appealing.
4.0,"It arrived pretty quickly and looks great! Except.. the watch band is about 11/2"" too big and I dont see a way to adjust it. üòï"
4.0,They have held up nicely all summer.  Very cute summer sandal.
4.0,Nice warm mid layer. FLY gear run small. Need to order up one size for pants or tops.
4.0,"ALOT Smaller than expected. The box literally fits in the palm of your hand but the keychain itself is cute, along with the message.. and since I didn‚Äôt buy it for the packaging, 4 stars for the smile it put on my stepfathers face."
4.0,"El tama√±o es grande, se ven bien terminadas, aunque el empaque en que vienen es sencillo."
4.0,"Nice Jacket, still to warm to tell if good for winter but is comfortable and Fit true to size"
4.0,Arrived today! It is a bright shade of pink but love it. I ordered the largest size (by reading other reviews) glad I did because and I typify wear a nice size 10 medium pant. Both the hoodie & pant are roomy just like a sweatsuit should be. Soooo comfy!  Love it üíì
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, nice fabric details.  It is very stiff at the mid sections  like a bridal down which is not necessarily a bad thing but if the zipper isn't strong enough it might pop when you sit.  I am 5 4"" and short waisted , the dress was at least 2 inches too In the mid section making for an awkward fit at the top"
4.0,Size was true. I'm 5'5&#34; and typically wear a size 18 and ordered a 2X and fit perfect. Covers well without having to deal with a sirong or shirt. I couldn't give it 5 stars because the pads in the chest area move around a lot and for someone like me with a larger chest they really aren't needed. Also the underneath is a boy short and a little bit short for someone who has bigger legs but I just pulled it up in my thighs and it was fine. Great coverage on the bottom.
4.0,Good bottles for the most part but one of them had some defects and I had to get rid of it because it was not screwing on properly and would come off when I was trying to fix them for my kids. I would purchase them again and hope that this time all the bottles would be correct.
4.0,"good quality, great price"
4.0,"Its a nice dress but, it clings to your body.  It does not flow as I normal like."
4.0,Material is very comfortable and classic color and fit. You can dress up or down.
4.0,"The shirt itself was good but unfortunately it was too snug on my boyfriend, which is why we returned it."
4.0,"Purchased two mediums for my teenage daughters! They like the jacket but it runs short. If you want it to look like the model's order at least two sizes bigger than what you would normally wear. Cute jacket though, just wished I would have known to order two sizes up."
4.0,Comfy.  True to size. Not the best support but perfect for house slippers
4.0,"Honestly, I'm not much of a sandal person. After years of working in casino and seeing some of the most frightening looking feet to ever grace the sidewalks of Las Vegas, I just don't like looking at feet. So, why did I order these? I work from home and quite honestly, no one's looking at my feet when I'm here other than myself and my seven pounds Malchi. I just need something to wear around the house and for when I step outside my fortress to check the mail. The first day was a bit odd, since I'm used to wearing Sketchers or ballet slippers. By the third day, they felt much more comfortable. There isn't much arch support and I have gel inserts for the toe separators. Makes them much more bearable to wear! I definitely wouldn't wear them if I had to do a lot of walking, but they are good for wearing around the house and short trips that don't require driving.<br /><br />Even though I received this product for free or at a discounted price, my review is honest and unbiased. If I don't like something about an item I test, I'm always upfront about it and mention it in my review. My rating and comments are my own, based on my personal opinion and experience when using this product."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a really cute dress, but it does run a little bigger than expected. I will still keep it. It comes with a belt that ties it in nicely. I do like the color and the way the fabric feels. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it‚Äôs a good length for me. The buttons are also cute :)"
4.0,"Was very light, but did not look exactly like the picture; less fluff."
4.0,"Very cute shorts, but if you tend to be a little thick in the waist, order a size up ( even with the stretch waistband)"
4.0,"I bought this for my dad for his birthday. He loved it, but I was personally thinking it was a thicker shirt. It‚Äôs not very heavy, but works great for dressing up an outfit. I would buy it again."
4.0,"I liked the fit, color,  fast service!"
4.0,The boots were beautiful and excellent quality but they ran very small and narrow so I had to return‚Ä¶ Very sad!
4.0,Just got my bands. 7 for the price is not bad. However I was attracted to the bright neon pink but band is actually a dark wineish pink. Other than that no complaints. Feels softer than my original band
4.0,"My daughter LOVES this nightgown. My only issue with it is that even after washing it a few times, the glitter still sheds like crazy. Not a major problem if your kiddo likes to sparkle."
4.0,"I have been seeing these kinds of earrings on a lot of girls lately and finally decided to get one. Couldn't be happier! The cuff part stays on my ear really well all day and doesn't hurt/ The part that goes in my ear is good but I would recommend using a different back (it comes with a rubber stopper that is not the best). Overall, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
4.0,"love the color(green), the fit, light weight(not a heavy, fleece or fuzzy robe). i like a long robe to go get my mail in the mornings in my apartment building(nice cover-up) and everyone has commented positively on the robe...would have definitely given this robe 5 stars, but for one thing...it is a lint magnet, come with-in 5 ft. of a towel, fuzzy robe, cat, and it's time to get the lint roller out, which i guess is a trade-off for all of the positives...it's PRETTY!!"
4.0,The length was small for my 13 year old tall son and he'll outgrow it soon but he loved it
4.0,Draw string waist was a nice addition.
4.0,The necklace was very pretty and looked expensive.  I wish it came in a better package - it was just in a little black bag and the necklace was very tangled when I took it out.
4.0,"This hat is so cute! I was so excited to get it but when I received it, it actually did not fit. Luckily, there is a little girl I know that liked it and it fit her. I love the color of the hat and the feel of it also, it gives off natural beachy or garden vibes. I also like the cotton ribbon, it is quite practical, it can be tied around the chin when the hat is worn or around the neck when the hat is not worn. Beautiful hat and beautiful ribbon."
4.0,"great fit, just very thin"
4.0,"Really lovely and good price. It's extremely hard to get the band on the watch. The package doesn't come with instructions, but there are instructions in the product images above. There is a tool to help, but it still takes me 10-15 minutes to switch out the bands."
4.0,"Not really flattering or stretchy, only giving 4 stars because bra fitting good"
4.0,Love this little lighthouse. It fits perfectly onto my charm bracelet and is just the right size. Simple yet elegant.
4.0,"I used this as part of my Arkham Catwoman cosplay and it looks really great! Good quality. It is very snug though so if you have a somewhat large head, this may not be comfortable. There is no strap under the chin so the only way to put it on or take it off is to pull it over your head/face. My only issue when wearing this is that I can't hear very well. I plan to poke a small hole near my ears and see if that helps. Overall, great detail!"
4.0,It‚Äôs really pretty. I definitely would recommend. The only thing is that the inside is white and because of the ruffles you can see that at the top of the top. But I really like it and I would get again
4.0,This bag hold a lot of those plastic grocery bags and it‚Äôs a good thick well put together product
4.0,Expensive but fit perfect. Dark lense best for high sunlight conditions.
4.0,not that big but wirks for small kids
4.0,There were only 3 bracelets instead of 4
4.0,Love it üòçüòçüòçüòç
4.0,"For a first timer, it took me a few tries before I found the right length. No instructions are included but there's a lot of images and videos online to help with that. I have never had any other bow tie so have no basis for comparison.<br /><br />It would have been helpful to have the neck sizes printed on the black part. Overall, I'm happy with the quality for the price."
4.0,"This dress hugs your curves so well üòç the straps are a little long, but not bad enough to take away the wow factor"
4.0,"I am 5 foot six and weigh 135 pounds. I am a US size 4/6 and the medium Is a perfect fit.  It hits mid-knee  and it‚Äôs very flattering. Note: the fabric is very thick and because it is synthetic it gets very hot. I‚Äôm happy I bought the skirt but there is just a very slight cheap quality about the print. However, the price is right."
4.0,I think it looks good and stylish .
4.0,Cute shirt but very tight.. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 145. Need one size up ( or lose 10 lbs) to feel less self-conscious.
4.0,The Red was more orange
4.0,They fit those of us with curvy hips. Love Gloria Vanderbilt!!
4.0,"Thought about returning the jacket because I should have gotten another size up.  SO if you're normally extra XL, goo with XXL. Oh, and if it's not rather chilly, this jacket does not breathe AT ALL, so you'll get that sweat going wherever the jacket is covering.  It's a good OUTER layer and not water resistant.  I think this year I'll hit it up with some of that water guard for next winter."
4.0,It is fine but I got the pink and I will definitely need a slip.  The dark colors may not have the same problem.
4.0,Love it! Although the xl was too big I got it adjusted. Skirt runs bing in size
4.0,I never purchased from this company before but berry pleased with jacket.
4.0,"This isn't grandma's heavy flannel.  In fact, it's pretty thin but seems well enough made and has nice vertical light blue stripes, rather that the more usual florals.  I have only washed it once so we'll see how it holds up once winter comes."
4.0,This is a pretty cool mask I used it just for a little fun to add to my ever growing mask collection. Although out is a heavy mask and I found I had to bend the feet a little around my ears to help keep it in place.
4.0,Simple flip flops that my kiddo loves
4.0,Really nice. Just wish chain was a little longer.
4.0,Its good.But its not genuine leather.
4.0,"bought them for a cruise, like how they fit and the style."
4.0,EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE.  GRANDSON LOVED IT!
4.0,Not fond of the side logo.
4.0,These gloves are super warm and fit well on my hands. I‚Äôve always had issues finding gloves large enough to fit my hands but the size xxl does the trick. The only slight negative is that the tactile feel on my gps screen doesn‚Äôt work as well as I expected.
4.0,Very nice dress for the price. My daughter is 13. Approximately 4'11. 85 lbs. I went with the size 14. Too big. Sent it back for a size 12.
4.0,ease of weating it fast shipping it is a very nice versatile product
4.0,Seems to work fine
4.0,"This band is comfortable and nice, but after wearing it for less than a week the pin holding the claps to the band came off somehow and I couldnt find it. It's not a pin like the others so I am not sure how to replace it."
4.0,This necklace is absolutely adorable. The chain and the charm are both made of what looks to be gold material and it's coated well. The chain is very sturdy and made from larger links than the typical small links. I like that the chain is attached directly to the charm on two spots so that it decreases the chances of the charm falling off and being lost. The charm has two loops in order for the chain to reattach it should it come loose. Also the chain itself is very strong and the clasp is very strong as well. The chain has a great length to it so that it falls just above the cleavage but isn't so short that it feels like a choker. The poodle is well-thought-out and the silhouette is the perfect shape of a poodle. I get compliments on this necklace all the time. I think it's a great buy and well worth the investment.<br /><br />Please note that I received this necklace at a reduced rate in return for an honest and unbiased review. This unbiased review is my own honest opinion after wearing the necklace myself.
4.0,It‚Äôs a pretty ring. It does feel cheap though. But great for costume jewelry I think.
4.0,Great for the price. They're pretty sturdy and cool-looking.
4.0,My toddler walks around in the all day
4.0,This is the perfect top to throw on with a pair of leggings and some cute boots.  Has a little sporty look to it but dresses up with a long necklace.  The length covers your backside and then there is a band around the bottom.  This is great with leggings but didn't work so well with pants.  I do like it.  It is easily becoming my go-to when I have a casual day but don't want to look like a slob.
4.0,"I've had this ring for a week. It's almost perfect. The only issue I've had is it's a little wide. If someone squeezes my hand, like to shake it, then the ring digs into my fingers. Other than that I love it. I did get a size 7 and its a little big but not too big. It doesn't come off my finger but it's loose. None of the stones have fallen out, I don't exactly keep it out of harms way either. I do everything with it on, washes off nicely. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for either a nice cheap wedding band or if you're looking for a ring until you get the one you want."
4.0,"I thought this glove design would not work for palm rejection as the pinky tip and ring finger are left uncovered. However, this glove is sold by MEKO who also sells stylus for average phone or tablet screens, so I thought it would be unlikely the glove would not work. Turns out, the thickness of this glove keeps those areas away from the screen.<br /><br />The S size glove seems of good quality and fits well on my small hand (My hand span is 8,25&#34; or 21cm). I would have liked the sleeve over the wrist to extend further back to prevent arm skin interference on the screen. The absence of this feature makes it a bit awkward to use the stylus on the screen as you need to hold your arm on the air.<br /><br />Previously I bought a cheap lycra glove that did not have palm rejection. I guess &#34;anti fouling&#34; is not palm rejection."
4.0,It's a thin material but fits me perfect! I love the way it looks.
4.0,Top is smaller fit whereas pants seem too big
4.0,"The fabric is not the same as what's pictured. The fit is good as well as the quality. The picture makes it look like the slip is made of silk satin. It's just a nice, sturdy polyester."
4.0,Had to spend a few minutes trimming off lots of excess string around laced edges before wearing it. Got a lot of compliments. Very comfortable.
4.0,"This fit ok, I ordered the extra small one because I have tiny boobs, even though my waist should have been the small size. It fit around the waist if I hid the modesty panel (leaving the back open under the lacing) and laced it loosely, but the boobs were still too big, and kind of awkwardly shaped. Luckily I know how to sew and will be able to fix it without too much trouble.<br /><br />Other than that it is beautiful!"
4.0,"The color is beautiful and true to the picture, but it fits a tiny bit big.  If you're kind of between sizes, err on the smaller side."
4.0,Nice soft well fitting socks. Wish they were seamless toe.
4.0,"Another reviewer said it, and I ignored it, but she was right--the soles on these shoes are incredibly slippery.  I fell down TWICE the first time I wore them, and it wasn't raining or anything.  Straightaway I went to a shoe store and bought those sticky things you put on soles for traction, and they've been fine so far.  I don't know why the manufacturer would make shoes with soles like that.  Otherwise, the shoes are great."
4.0,"I enjoy this purchase. It is comfortable and I really love the pockets. The material is soft and it's so easy to put on in the mornings. It is a tunic style, so it can be really easy to make you look bigger than you actually are. But a belt would solve all of that. Sizing isn't much of an issue because it's so flowy."
4.0,"Doesn't look like the photo, it looks more like a dusty gray"
4.0,"These are nice shorts, and great quality.  They just didn't fit me well - a bit tight in the hips, so I returned them.  Loved the pockets."
4.0,Nice and cool but I got an XL because reviews said it ran kinda big and it didn't in my case. I will order a XXL next time.
4.0,"Cute belt. Works with formal or more casual outfits. The buckle just locks together, but holds well. Four stars because mine came with a little snag on it that I had to cut away."
4.0,tear at the toes very easy. very cute though!
4.0,OK LITTLE SOFT METAL BENDS EASY
4.0,"The pair my hubby ordered for me for Mother's Day, from my wish list, came with one earring missing the end of the earring (the Wisteria color). They ARE pretty, but I don't know how they will work in my ear lobes because I haven't been able to wear them.  Hubby will be returning them as soon as he can, hopefully to exchange for a pair with ALL the parts.<br />Done and Done.<br />I now have this pair and the Wisteria pair, and I love them! Not as heavy as I feared, nor as big. They are not even 1.5 inches long, but that's not a problem at all.  The short length keeps the earrings looking dainty and sparkly. Had they been bigger, I might have looked like a Vegas show girl, which is NOT the look I'm going for!  The only thing is that the photo shows a silvertone wire hook. My earrings have cheap dark metal hooks. If I made my own jewelry, it would not be a problem to switch wires, I'm sure. If I can find a friend who does this, I will, because these earrings are so pretty, to ME!"
4.0,Have not used them yet. But hopefully they will survive the airlines. Got them to replace soft sided luggage that was destroyed by airlines.
4.0,Beautiful on and really comfy
4.0,"Super tight due to the material, recommend size up, they are easy to pull off if you don't have them pulled up all the way. Okay sock for the price but not a miracle as portrayed. My son got them off first time. He's 13mo"
4.0,"It‚Äôs true to size around the chest but flowy around the stomach. I‚Äôm a dress size 14 with a 38DD bra, and I ordered an XL and it‚Äôs perfect around the chest but loose around the stomach. I like the fit being a little loose anyway so I don‚Äôt mind it!"
4.0,My husband digs and lays pipe for work. His actual wedding band was getting ruined so I bought these. They are ok but just look really big on his finger. They are safer for him so that is what is important
4.0,I really like this top. I paired it with a cute skirt and I've also worn it with jeans. I usually wear XL in tops and this top fit comfortably. I will purchase other colors.
4.0,I love this comfy tshirt. Color is very nice and bright too.
4.0,"I liked these. They came in a cute box. They're thinner than i expected but they work. They did roll up a bit after  wearing a  few times, which irritated me. I thought they would hold their shape longer. Not all of the socks did that, just two pair i believe.  Also the non slip little grip design on the bottoms are wearing off a bit. They really help keep your feet from sliding in your shoes while walking.  I wear a pair of them 3 or four days a week with my slip on mule style tennis shoes. They're not easy to find  in stores. So I was glad to find them online.  They are a bit expensive so i expected better quality."
4.0,"Our daughter does like these women‚Äôs ripped jeans and she says she likes the zipper button closure, the 5 pockets and the design of the wide leg. She says she has been wearing them for the last few days and she likes that they fit her well and they are comfortable to wear.<br />Our daughter says she always gets some compliments whenever she goes out with these loose streetwear denim pants and she likes the high waist styling and distressed design. She likes that they match some of her tops and shoes. I would recommend them."
4.0,Good shirt comfortable. Just wish the print was better dul looking upon first inspection
4.0,"Comfortable, soft material. Would definitely buy in another color."
4.0,This was very cute and forgiving! Nice stomach area for a pooch.
4.0,"The frames are super nice; strong, sturdy, and big enough for my large head. Stylish without being too ostentatious. I wish the lenses matched the quality of the frames. The lenses are fine, but nothing spectacular. They seem the same as any cheap polarized glasses you would find at a gas station for $20 or less. These glasses are still good value, but I would gladly pay a little more for nice multi-coated glass lenses or optically superior polycarbonate lenses. I have no regrets getting these, but it kind of feels like a sports car with a small engine."
4.0,He loves his shoes.the shoes are wide so they are a little big for size 12. But they looked beautiful on him
4.0,"These glasses are well made however much darker green lenses than I expected...Also, as far as the size of the lenses, they are just about two inches...I just purchased 2 pair of some that cost several dollars less than these...I got a yellow, and a blue...Both are nice and light color and can go right to stage with me...AND...AND...the lenses are a fraction over an inch and a half  (40mm)...This size is really the ones I feel anybody would rather have. ..They don't look awkward..As you get to that two inch or more size, it can be hit or miss depending on your taste. ..40mm is perfect and there's no Elton Big Giant Round Things on my face!....Don't get me wrong, , they have become my day to day driving , sun glasses and they do that well with plenty of UV protection to boot...The others are my work glasses.....I'm an old hippie musician and they are perfect for the stage...Half inch smaller lenses too. (Better)......Stay tuned for more!&#34;&#34;"
4.0,"I ordered both Set 3 and Set 4.<br /><br />Regarding Set 3, the set with the classic buckle.<br />Cute! I bought these with the intention of adding a pop of color to several dresses I own. The colors are nice and they will work great for what I bought them for. There is no obvious manufacturing flaws other than about a the belts are not all exactly the same length. I can see about a centimeter difference between the longest and shortest belt. Be aware that they did say that the sizes are approximate and I'm on the last hole with a measurement of 33"", on the part of my waist where I intend to wear the belt, at the time of this review. For a little over $1 per belt I did not expect the belts to fool anyone for being expensive but they are perfectly acceptable for a fun accessory.<br /><br />Regarding Set 4, with the long rectangular metal buckle.<br />This set definitely looks a bit nicer than Set 3. It might be the fancier buckle design or the fact that the synthetic material is slightly thicker. I bought this set with similar intentions as with Set 3. The white belt came with glue all over part of the buckle area, something that I'll probably be able to scrape off, but in all honesty the white was the one I was least keen on. On my monitor the brown belt looked really orange but in person the orange hue is not that prominent. Unlike Set 3, all the belts seem to be very close in length. Set 4 is also about 1"" longer than Set 3, even after taking into consideration the extra length needed for the different buckle style.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with both purchases and if you plan on using the belts as an accessory rather than something to keep pants up with, they will work fine."
4.0,It looks lose on the sides in the picture but it doesn't flow as I wanted it too...still a really nice shirt great material.
4.0,comfy. is washing and wearing well. good value.
4.0,"This little gadget is a lifesaver. It's perfect for if a shirt is too low, or button fell off, or attached bra straps to a shirt so they won't be seen. Only thing is, it didn't come with the stitches, but I believe they are sending them. It's super convenient."
4.0,"I bought these gloves to use only for mowing the lawn to dampen the vibration of the mower and to prevent blisters.  I couldn't be happier with the performance of the gloves in this regard.  They are too big but, as a woman, I wear a women's small glove, and these are a men's medium.  They fit my husband's medium-sized hands perfectly.  My only complaint is that they are a little hot.  Overall, however, I highly recommend these gloves."
4.0,"I like it for the most part, especially because it kind of smooths the sides. However, i marked it down because it is a little uncomfortable when sitting down."
4.0,"Great cuff bracelet for a free-spirited person who enjoys something a little different.  The bracelet is very ""sparkly"" without looking like excessive ""bling.""  The bracelet stretches to fit any wrist size.  Step outside the box and enjoy this FUN bracelet!  I think you will really like it."
4.0,It is cute but for younger person.
4.0,Beautiful and great quality but I would size it up one size. Still fits though
4.0,"Nice look, good quality!<br /> But the size that I normally wear was smaller."
4.0,Good hoodie. Neck hole is tight to get my noggin through. I hope it doesn't shrink in the wash.
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, quality seems nice.  Size guide is accurate. Chose the XL based on the waist measurement and it fits exactly.  Would definitely order again."
4.0,"Very thin but the black paisley is really nice and not see thru. Comfortable and soft. But, In the pic, the hem flares out into these ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù that spread and look fine. In reality, they hang down limp as though they were wet or had a knot tied at the end and look so so. Tried to iron them out but only slight improvement, still not quite as perky as the pic."
4.0,"The bag lays flat against my body which I like.  I am still getting used to the bag since my previous one was a Baggallini with lots of pockets but no RFID facilities.  This Travelon bag does not have as many pockets.  I love the &#34;lock&#34; fastener at the front and the fact that there is a zip for the main compartment and a flap.  The bag is big enough to put an ipad in the main compartment and an umbrella, if needed.  It is well designed."
4.0,"The overall make of dress is great for my style. I ordered the extra large according to measurements, but is a little tight at top, but still fits me."
4.0,Love the top.  Material a bit slippery and need to double knot tie. Very flattering
4.0,Sun protection at pool and vacation st the Cape and Panama
4.0,"This pendant is very attractive in its minimalist presentation of the tree of life. Personally, I would choose any other chain than the snake chain that  came with it. I just don't like snake chains. The pendant is very much worth the price. I wear this pendant as part of my daily jewelry.  The side of the pendant that is viewable is shiny - I believe that it is rodium-coated. Know that the underside that rests on one's skin is convex with only the very rim being shiny; otherwise, the underside is not shiny. Because of the size and shape of this pendant, it is very unlikely to turn over, and show the duller side. I would definitely recommend this lovely piece, and I would buy it again."
4.0,They feel as good as expected
4.0,"Fit my 4 1/2 year olds 1/2 size acoustic guitar. I've never played a guitar before, so I had to Google how to attach this. Would have been nice if it had come with basic instructions. Otherwise seems like it's of good quality. Love the pocket for the pick."
4.0,Very strong chemical smell when I opened the package. Shoes were also way too big.
4.0,Decent quality for a cheap sandal for the gym shower
4.0,The fit is amazing and comfy the only thing is the tag would be way better without it
4.0,"I'm rather satisfied with the band, I just wish it closed the opposite direction."
4.0,"Comtable to wear, its easy to slide it on and off. Fair price and fast shipping."
4.0,"Soft fabric that keeps ‚Äúbreathes‚Äù well, so you don‚Äôt get too warm.  Bright color is also pleasing to the eye.  Fits a bit too large however."
4.0,Comfortable dress to wear out to dinner
4.0,"This band fits my wrist (9&#34;), just barely. But as the band my Pebble Steel came with didn't fit at all, it's an improvement."
4.0,Love these jeans. Wish they were a bit longer when unfolded though. But they do fit great.
4.0,Fits my head a little small and material kinda cheap. Overall cute.
4.0,"Nice. Sturdy, durable.<br /><br />I wish the lavender was slightly more colored -- it looks more like a lavender-gray and looks a little dull.<br /><br />Large and carries a lot. I can fit my iPhone 6 in it."
4.0,"I love it !!!!<br />Love the color and length, I am tall and most dresses  tend to be a little shorter than I would like."
4.0,"very nice, but lens is smaller than expected"
4.0,Haven't had it a year and it has broken. Cool watch though
4.0,"Great looking hilt but isn't the best working saber I own. The sound is very quiet, the flash on clash will stop working every now and then, and the effects from the blade aren't nearly as nice as I have seen in online reviews. I changed batteries and then the blade would light up but I had no sound or anything. Possibly old batteries. Will buy new ones and see if it helps. Will update if anything changes.<br /><br />Even with new batteries, the sound of these sabers is almost whisper quiet. I have the Mace Windu and Ahsoka Tano sabers. Hilts are nice but blade effects and sound leave much to be desired."
4.0,"I ordered this skirt to wear for family pictures. It's gorgeous in person - the colors are really rich, and unlike with some dresses you can get through Amazon, actually looks nicer and not cheap in person. My only critique is the waistband - on mine the elastic was sewn off-center of the tag, and the way the waistband is sewn actually makes you look more plump - instead of cascading down nicely, it pooches out on your hips. I tried to solve this by using a wide belt over the waistband, which helped but didn't totally solve the problem. I still wore the skirt for family pictures, and it photographed well, but definitely wasn't slimming. Next time I wear it I might try a shirt not tucked in, or wear a cardigan."
4.0,"I bought these shirts to wear under my work shirt. They fit well, seem to not trap heat and have felt good in the hot weather. The price is good for three shirts. I would recommend them."
4.0,Great fabric.  Get lots of compliments. Sleeves are a little small in upper arms.
4.0,"This is a very pretty pendant, my only thought is it looks more like copper(color), than rose gold...but its still a quality piece and definately giftable."
4.0,"Great shoes. One little strap broke, but super glue fixed it right up. Fits great, a little big."
4.0,Item is as described.  Its pretty and is comfortable  to wear. Only thing is i wish it were a litter longer to cover under chin more.
4.0,"No issues. I saw on some past reviews that it looks like a rag, but mine had cuffs on the sleeves around the neck/shoulders and the bottom edge was hemmed and stitched. It is a little thin though"
4.0,Other than that great for the price. Guess I have a large (shaved) head as it fits me pretty tight.
4.0,"Good quality and color. I really like it except that the listed measurements were inaccurate. It measures 8&#34; x 5&#34; exactly, which makes it slightly too small for my needs. I have to return it, which sucks because I really like the design."
4.0,"I will begin with the positives. These boots fit exactly as expected. They are very comfortable and the leather is durable. I can wear these at work for 10 hours walking in various terrain and my feet don't hurt.<br /><br />Now the negatives. They are absolutely not waterproof. My feet got wet walking through dewy grass. Some waterproofing treatment would probably help. I'll do that on the next pair as this pair is worn out already. The picture shows the stitching on the inward side of the right boot has completely blown out and the sole is coming unglued. I really question the ""1,000,000 push ups"" rating in the description.<br /><br />I haven't thrown out these boots though because they are so comfortable. I keep them for working around the house. I'll still buy another pair but I will waterproof them before wearing."
4.0,"Just received this!!! I looveeeee it. Fits nice, holds up the body well, However there are a few problems I found,  One, it's warm. Perfect for winter time, sadly I live in Florida and we don't get much winter so I'm hot on it. The second part is that the waist strings in the back fits me a bit big, I wish there was an extra small, I'm thick but I'm short so the dress goes a bit over my knee. Will buy again from this company, also wow to the material, it's good, worth the money. Will buy more from company.<br /><br />Tip for girls who want to wear bra. It's hard to find a bra that will go with this dress, I'm a mommy of three so my boobs NEEDS a bra. What I do is put on thick clear tape. I know strange, but it sticks and holds perfectly. Just make sure the bra has no type of strings. Works well for me,  hope that helps."
4.0,Love this thus far. Zipper and all works. Came packaged great and no smell.<br />The colour is a bit darker than picture and the bag is large and sure to hold everything.<br />Will see how it wears overtime as I intend to use as my main work bag
4.0,I‚Äôd order up a size!!
4.0,"Fit was way too big compared to another shirt I got from here , otherwise cute .not returning because I can just wear it to sleep in"
4.0,"This PJ set is well-constructed and cute enough to wear out of the house. I personally don‚Äôt wear shorts this short if I‚Äôm going somewhere ‚Äî at my age, the legs aren‚Äôt what they used to be ‚Äî but I‚Äôll wear them around home. The shirt is a little boxy, and the V-neck is too low on me, but I‚Äôll just wear a tank under it. It‚Äôs definitely a top I‚Äôll wear in public with capris or jeans.<br /><br />Be aware that this set does run large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 165 lbs, and wear a 38G bra. I generally wear an XL or XXL top, and I ordered this set in XL. It fits okay, but it's pretty loose. I‚Äôll still keep it; however, I could have gotten away with getting a Large."
4.0,"I received urban camo instead of tiger stripe, but it wasn't worth the hassle to return it. It will do the job."
4.0,"loved the color, keeps you warm enough on the bus or train, got many complements. Be careful when you put it inside the bag because it can get damaged with the rough substances. For the price worth buying."
4.0,"Maybe I looked at the pictures wrong but I didn't realize there were flat until I got them. My 7b year old wanted them for his book bag and they're still on there, not broken yet so it's all good."
4.0,"Its very plastic, its ok, fits a bit tight. You get what you pay for. Plain and simple. It works for a simple cheap back up."
4.0,"This is a cute skirt with pockets. If you are short like I am, it came down too long and with the pleats it would cost too much to alter, more than the price of the skirt. So had to return."
4.0,"The first i i ordered these earrings they were exactly as pictured. My daughter loved  the design and she had no infections. She lost one earring so we ordered a new pair, this one looked way different, i honestly liled the first original design better, so did my daughter. However she still liked them enough to not return them."
4.0,"Love the ties, but the clasps are not what I expected. They are hard for me to open and close and our son wants to do them himself. That's not possible. Everytime I open the tie clip I'm afraid it's going to break."
4.0,"5'5 140 lbs 34B medium fits perfectly.  The color is more papaya than dark coral. Ladies with bumps and lumps will want a light weight camisole shaper to smooth everything out.  Really shows off my lovely back rolls without it.  The bottom flares out nicely though without being to much it's very feminine. Easy to dress up or down for summer- I attend alot of ""smart casual"" events and find these basic dresses to be a great basis for pulled together but not over done looks. The fabric seems thinner than the other brand I've ordered but it's not see through in the least"
4.0,"It like it. Wish the gold was more gold instead of a deep bronze but we shall see how it goes. I ordered an XL, I am 5'11+170lbs. It fits nicely. Def order a size up. My only complaint is the bronze color."
4.0,Makes a lovely confirmation gift. The blue bead adds a nice sparkle.
4.0,"Super cute shades! I have a smaller face and these fit perfectly. The quality is okay, they're not very sturdy. Overall, they're lightweight. The lenses themselves are not very dark either, you can see your eyes through them which I'm okay with. I'm pretty happy with my purchase, I've gotten quite a few compliments."
4.0,Definitely a HIT and worth the buy. Had to get mines hem but they were a HIT
4.0,but a little bulky
4.0,Easy care; cool to wear; keeps its shape
4.0,"I really like these glasses. Their light , and fit my face really well. I'll wear these mostly when I'm active playing Tennis or chasing my son around the yard. Will probably buy another pair at some point."
4.0,Good quality sweatshirt. The lettering is just a bit more faded than pictured
4.0,I think this is so cute on. Comfortable too. Only downside is it took 2.5 months to get to me. Almost missed the weather to wear it in. Would give 5 stars but didn't because of the shipping speed.
4.0,I am a handicapped lady  and can't put them on myself.<br />So the lady that helps me says they're easy and stay on very well.
4.0,Compression socks. They fit tight
4.0,"These fit well, they're comfortable, and they're appropriate for a variety of occasions. My only two complaints is that there are no belt loops and it tends to wrinkle in the hips and back of the knees. It irons easily, however."
4.0,My husband loved the wallet except for the change pocket.
4.0,"I have a bigger chest, and I wish it had a little more coverage for my cleavage, but I can work with covering it up. I bought this so I could have a dress to nurse in, and it's really nice to have something easy, and it's a very pretty flowy dress."
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter..she absolutely loves it
4.0,didn't like the pocket
4.0,"Great compression socks. I recommend this brand, have tried others. The elasticity is un matched and this product is of good quality. I will buy another in near future."
4.0,"I used this bag for school, carrying my 13&quot; laptop, a binder, small book, chargers, calc,pens and sometimes a lunch. I loved this bag to death, carrying it anywhere I commuted. The materials chose to construct the bag were sturdy and stylish.<br /><br />However the seams holding in the sturdy strap couldn't uphold the changing weight when moving around. The bag was able to last about one semester of school, 4 months, until the front seam gave way and dropped off my shoulder. I was lucky to catch the bag before reaching the concrete, but the construction of the seam that hold the strap can definitely improve."
4.0,It's cute.  I think I'll send it back for a size larger.  Just tried it on today.
4.0,"The swimsuit fits as expected. I got the black, gray and red one. Bought it for my daughter. She loves it and can't wait to go to the beach. The quality is very nice. Not flimsy at all. The breast area was padded not removable. Fits true to size. Will eventually purchase a different style for her as well."
4.0,"I purchased this dress in the wine color. the dress has a discolored line in the front at the neck. If you wear a scarf it might hide it.<br />The hem line is off a bit from the front to the back. Trying to decide to keep it or return it. Not sure if I would purchase another one though, not sure if all the colors do same thing or if it just this dress and/or just this color."
4.0,"I like this dress but I don't love it. I think it is a little overpriced. The fabric is similar to a cotton dishtowel. It's really pretty and I was going for the Cath Kidston look. I bought the small - 34B, 130 pounds, 5'6' and it fits perfectly every where except the hips. There is probably an extra 2 inches of fabric in the hips which adds to the flared out effect but makes me look larger in that area than I really am. It's a pretty summer dress but I think it should have been cheaper for what it is."
4.0,great quality!! Keep in mind it's american size; so it's roomy =)
4.0,"The packing cube system arrived in a timely manner and well-packaged.  The cubes' fabric is strong, yet sufficiently pliable to accommodate over packing, and zippers are strong.  All shirts and trousers folded and placed in the cubes maintained their folds without additional wrinkling.  Cubes afforded the opportunity to pack clothes in combinations for a set # of days, which negated the need to open and unpack an entire suitcase. It would be good if the cubes' material were stiffer to hold the shape of the cube better; however, that might also disallow overpacking.  All-in-all, the TravelWise Packing Cube System was a good investment and will be used frequently for both long and short term travel."
4.0,"I work in events and joggers are the most comfortable thing to wear for long days. These are similar to a Nike Pro material but not as tight, if that makes sense? I got the Black highwaist joggers in a size small. I'm 5'2"" and weigh around 110 if that helps anyone with sizing. They don't slip down but they did pill a little bit but only because the fanny pack I was wearing with them one day was sparkly (LOL). Haven't noticed any issues and HIGHLY recommend buying if you're looking for a comfy pair of flattering joggers!"
4.0,Sandals look well made however o my work once as of now. Hopefully we don‚Äôt have issues with them falling a part.
4.0,"Good fit for my face but slightly small for my husband.  the fabric and shape creates a good structured face mask with extra space to make breathing and talking easier without sucking in the fabric if you know what I mean. Minus 1 star cause the 'nose bridge wire' of all 5 masks were not centralized.  However, it is easy to adjust simply by flattening the face mask and adjust the wire with your fingers.  For this price,  it is a good buy, value for money and highly recommend for those looking for comfort, breathable face masks and I certainly hope it has good protection too from this awful Covid-19.  Stay safe!"
4.0,"I always buy Time and Tru pants in XL, but these were way TOO SMALL"
4.0,"These pants are totally cute. They are snug on the waist line but I took the other reviewers' advice and ordered a size up so they fit really well. I'm 5'1"" so the pants are about 4-6 in too long for me but I love the bottom hem so I'm just going to move it up to fit."
4.0,"Since sizing is often ""off"" in these I thought I would start earlier this year looking for an outfit for Oktoberfest, last year I didn't start early enough and ran out of time.  I came across this one and thought that I'd give it a try as I wanted a mini instead of the long version.  After reading the reviews the first size I ordered was a 24, typically I wear an 18/20 in most items.  The 24 was way too big. Based on the size of the 24, the next size I ordered was a 20 and it fit great. It is a tiny bit snug when I zip it up but there is plenty of room in the chest.  For me, I'd say this runs almost true to size.  It's high quality, which is good because it is on the pricier side.  This is definitely a piece that you can wear over and over, one that will last a long time.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  The only thing that I did differently was that I ordered a different shirt to go with it, as I wanted a bit more cleavage to show and the shirt that came with it was very stiff and thick, making it too hot together."
4.0,Very cool glasses and the quality is pretty good for the price. I have had compliments on them.
4.0,looks better on than I expected.  This works fine
4.0,"These are not clipped earrings. There are for pierced ears.  There are very pretty and I wished I could've kept them, but I cannot wear pierced earrings.  Packaging and delivery were excellent.  Seller recommended!"
4.0,Great size and durability
4.0,"They are good material and beautiful, I just order a wrong size. I was hoping that it will fit my granddaughter but it didn‚Äôt happens."
4.0,These charms are cute and pretty detailed but they are also kind of thick and they stick out a lot on the nails. I also have small nail beds and they are almost too big. Good for a little holiday touch on your manicure if you don't mind the thickness/size.
4.0,Love them just the wrong color I thought I was getting the lighter color and I got the dark color. Still gonna wear them üëçüèΩ
4.0,Bought for my mom. It is larger than I expected and had I know I probably wouldn‚Äôt have purchased for a 60 something year old but as long as you‚Äôre aware of the size then it‚Äôs a good necklace
4.0,"my husband seamed to like them right before he lost them after 2 days,"
4.0,Beautiful dress. I ordered the long sleeve in dark green. I'm 148lb and 5'6&#34;. I ordered a medium as usual and it fits great. My only negative is that the picture shows the dress sitting above the knee and for me is a few inches below so it's quite a bit longer even thought I'm not usually considered short.
4.0,"Purchased to cover forearm tattoo just-in-case. A little snug, but it should be. Not quite my skin tone - a little too pink, but close enough that if I have to do this it will cover for a group photo."
4.0,Cute but can‚Äôt wash at home so it costs more to clean than what I paid
4.0,While I love this mittens they are nice and Warm--the color mittens arrived where NOT purple and mint green but rather pinkish and orange.
4.0,The glasses is good but the pack got thorn in a shot time of use.
4.0,It would've gotten 4 stars but the color is totally off. It's supposed to be &#34;gray&#34; and it's &#34;tan&#34;. Other than that it is a great belt.
4.0,I like this sweater however the white stitch part on the wrist is a little too long and awkward. You want to roll it in half but other than that I love it.
4.0,Love this materal and fit. Order a larger size for washing.
4.0,"The shoulder pads are a part of the look but it may be a little too aggressive for some. I decided to cut out the pads for a more muted look. The sleeve opening is a bit large - kind of like a muscle tee - so beware if you're not keen on showing off side boob or bra. Decent price and fabric, I think it'll last!"
4.0,Fit is a bit large for my personal style but not too bad. I ended up keeping it but wish it was a little smaller.
4.0,Great customer service with question about sizing.  Ordered a size up as recommended and it fits fine.  The style is a bit boxy.  It looks like I am wearing a medical scrub top with no fit to it.  Its comfy and the fabric is nice.  I'm keeping it
4.0,"Great product, easy installation. I wish they came with the nose pads too."
4.0,This bra is amazing!  So incredibly comfortable that I forget that I have it on a lot! The only downside is that it isn't very supportive... then again it's a sleeping bra not a sports bra!
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter‚Äôs band concert. She absolutely adored it and received several compliments. Plus, it has pockets!"
4.0,The material is a little thinner than I'd hoped but it's fine to wear to work.
4.0,So cute and it fits nicely!
4.0,"The jacket is perfect, hat is super small and shoes are kind of silly.  Defiantly not worth $70 but will keep it because my daughter needs it for a play she‚Äôs in."
4.0,"Looks really cute. Fits nice. Material is on the thin side so you probably have to wear no show panties. I love the top, id wear it separate with jeans or something. Im a size 16 or 1x but i got xxl to be safe. Probably could of done a xl"
4.0,Not thrilled with the cut nor the material. Doesn‚Äôt breath well in humidity. I still wear it to work though.
4.0,"This dress was a HIT!! Loved it. But let me give you a tip. Order up! I wear a medium in all of my dresses. After reading the reviews I ordered an xl and it fit perfectly. Probably the only thing in my closet in an xl. The only reason why I took away a star is because the material is pretty cheap. See pic 2, how the material separates in the bust and hip areas. It definitely wasn‚Äôt too tight, just a cheap material. I had to scrap those pics.  Nevertheless I got all kinds of compliments and would definitely order something similar and recommend! Price was excellent!"
4.0,"I love the design and fabric of this skirt. The polka dots and chiffon make it so fun to wear. After reading the reviews, I originally ordered this skirt two sizes up but when it arrived it swallowed me. I exchanged it for my normal size, which fit like expected. I did notice, however, that there were unexpected seams in odd places on the skirt which make the fabric patterns not line up. It seems like after so many &#34;it's too small&#34; reviews the manufacturers just added a panel of fabric to the side of the skirt. They did a decent job disguising it and because of the way the fabric folds inwards you can't really see the seams when you're standing, but the seams do bother me that the patterns don't line up and when I'm sitting and I look down I think &#34;has my skirt twisted?&#34;<br />The outer fabric is light and has tons of great movement.<br />It's also good to note that the lining is very sheer and definitely needs a slip underneath.<br />But overall I really like the skirt. I wish the seams weren't so weird but overall it's a nice, summery skirt at a very good price."
4.0,Love them.  The fit is great and block the sun perfectly.
4.0,"He liked it However the words are screen printed on, not stitched."
4.0,Very pretty!  Little smaller than I thought they would be.
4.0,Me encanta como queda.
4.0,"great quality - it‚Äôs that thick mesh that quality jerseys have, not the thinner nylon of cheaper ones. only criticism is that for some reason the lettering and numbers are plastic that has been sewn on."
4.0,Beautiful color.  Thank you.  Lots of compliments when I wear this dress.
4.0,"Cute and flowy, but thin. I wore an undershirt with it...very cute tucked into a circle skirt"
4.0,"Great for on the go! I use it as a regular wallet in my purse and just keep the longer strap wrapped up in the purse pocket so that when I need to just run in a store, or if I‚Äôm out and about at night and don‚Äôt want to carry my full purse, I just pull it out, attach the strap, and go! iPhone XS Max fits perfectly in the outside pocket. Plenty room for cards, cash, etc. Only complaint it‚Äôs it‚Äôs a little difficult to get cards in and out of the slots but nothing too crazy. Still worth it and still a great alternative to those times you don‚Äôt want a whole big purse to lug around."
4.0,"I do not like the Oriental Trading Post sticker on the underside of the visor, It does not come off easily, you have to run it under water and then only the top of sticker comes off so you are still left with the tacky part still on the visor."
4.0,"The chain broke pretty quickly after I bought it. But I don‚Äôt think that should be the focus, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, necklace chains are pretty cheap. The real focus is the charm. The flower is absolutely beautiful, I wear it as much as I possibly I can. And of course when people compliment it I launch into the backstory from SpiderMan. If I ever lose it I‚Äôll definitely be rebuying here."
4.0,"It came way earlier than they said it would!! It is nice fabric a little more see through than I thought but over all really cute!! The back is criss crossing strings and I love it, bought my usual size and it fit perfect"
4.0,Helped keep my ankles from blowing up on a 6 hour flight!
4.0,Daughter's Graduation..very satisfied
4.0,"This is a small, pretty clutch bag that I used when I went to a wedding. It matched my black patent leather shoes perfectly. It is rather narrow inside and doesn't allow you to put much inside. I was able to squeeze my cell phone and keys in it but it was rather difficult to close it. Over-all I think it was worth my money"
4.0,"Work as well as expected , comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Compression is evenÔºå."
4.0,This dress is very cool.  I ordered a medium.  Note: I'm 5'10&#34; and the dress drags on the ground.  The top is made for a full figured woman while the waist is normal.  The sleeves are very loose
4.0,I like the fact my husband works in a place with security he cannot have any medal on his body now he can wear is jeans without falling down LOL
4.0,I liked this sweater. Its something to throw on when you have to run errands or just a casual day with friends. I ordered the XL and it fit as expected.
4.0,It's good- it does the job for an amateur costume.
4.0,runs  a bit small
4.0,"From the little lady:<br /><br />We just moved to a hot desert climate. The highs are already in the 90s, and it‚Äôs only April! So I have been looking for lightweight cotton clothing to keep me cool this summer. This dress definitely has possibilities!<br /><br />First of all, the fabric is perfect! Sturdy enough to keep looking good through multiple washings, but lightweight enough to ‚Äúbreathe.‚Äù Even though it‚Äôs 100% cotton, it did not seem to shrink when washed and dried, as directed. I was worried about the color fading, but it did not change. I love the rich burgundy color. It‚Äôs a nice departure from the blues and greens I usually wear, without being too obnoxious.<br /><br />Second, it is well made. The hemlines are double-folded, so no raw edges are exposed. The neckline is properly faced. The seams are serged, and I did not have to cut a bunch of threads before or after washing.<br /><br />The fit and cut are a bit odd. The sleeves fit great‚Äînot too tight or too loose. The length of the dress comes just below my knees, which is wonderful. The neck opening is a bit lower than I prefer, but I can easily remedy that by sewing in a lace or cotton panel. But the unexpected part is how large the bodice is and how strangely it is shaped. I ordered the correct size, but there is a lot more fabric extending out to the sides of my body than expected. I might have to find some matching ribbon to attach to the side seams to cinch it up or tailor the sides a bit. Weirder still is how the bodice arches up toward the neckline in the front and then plunges several inches in the back. It‚Äôs almost as if it was designed as a maternity dress!<br /><br />A slip is definitely necessary with this dress, too. The fabric is not see-through, but it is thin enough you can see a silhouette when you stand in the sun.<br /><br />This dress was going for about $26 at the time of this review. That‚Äôs not bad for 100% cotton that is well-made. Once I make a few necessary modifications, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be happy with it. And any expectant mother would find it would work both during and after her pregnancy."
4.0,"Really like how it looks on my timex, putting it on wasn‚Äôt that bad just wish it had that little mechanism in the strap where you just pull it back and you can release the strap but overall still good."
4.0,They were very unique.<br />I bought these for a sorority get together.
4.0,Glad a review had told me they ran small and they run very small - I ordered a size larger and wish I ordered it two sizes larger.  Nice shirts and glad I ordered them.
4.0,The bag is very nice. Love the handles.  Just wish it was a big larger.
4.0,"I just got this in the mail, saw reviews and says fits smaller than expected so i ordered a large instead of a medium.. Fits good.. Not bad. Love that its thin, perfect for summer.. Thank you."
4.0,It so very nice protect my son from cold air in winter of chicaago<br />and he ijou it . thank you
4.0,this cover-up is beautiful. it does fit a little snug and doesn‚Äôt really have any give to it. I would recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Bad bunny sun glasses I like um the cheap feeling though
4.0,"Material and Quality are good and justify the higher than normal slipper price tag. Initially, these things seem to run small. The furry, wool stuff is fluffy creating a snug feel. My assumption and hope is that this will change after a few days of wear, compression and stretching. They are almost just right and I don't want to deal with the return hassle so, I'll keep trying but what others have said appears to be true. Heed this advice - these things run small, order one size larger, especially if you normally wear socks. If you don't wear socks, you'll probably be ok with normal sizing.<br /><br />If I'm able to update this review later, after a couple weeks, I will."
4.0,Little hard.  But overall nice band.  Recommended
4.0,"Appears to be a very good &#34;non-OEM&#34; alternative.  Appearance is just about identical to the original Luminox band on my Luminox 8822.MI watch.  You have to look very closely to see any differences.  Has nice black metal buckle, same textured pattern, same dimensions and details as the original.  Fits perfectly.  Upon close inspection you will see that there are no metal inserts in the pin holes as on the original and there are no Luminox brand markings on the band.  Overall quality looks to be very good for a non-original branded item.  Another nice plus is that it included a pin removal tool and a set of new pins.  I would rate it as an excellent value for the price I paid."
4.0,"I really couldn't figure out how to wear it - I guess I'm too old for these fancy out-of-the-box jewelry.  I only took away one star because they do make awesome necklace pendants.  I will probably be ordering these again, depending on interest on interest."
4.0,I purchased this band for my Seiko 5 and I am happy to report it fits perfectly has quick release springs. I think the buckle is a bit too big and bold and I replaced it with one I had from an old watch. So far so good!
4.0,Great deal... Great for the cost
4.0,"I was going to buy a digital picture frame, but they're 20X more expensive compared to something much simpler like this keychain picture frame. It's much bigger than I thought it would be. Only complication is that you have to snap a plastic cover over your picture to lock it inside the frame - I thought that it would be designed so that you simply slide your picture in.<br /><br />Be aware, however, that this thing is 2"" x 3"". Perfect for my needs, but I'm NOT using it on my keychain! It's so large that, @ least IMO, it'll make any set of keys very bulky. If you're OK with that, then fine. Otherwise, you need to look for a something smaller, like 1"" x 2""."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1d73ca91387477eda5896d059515d583]] The unit heats up nicely and the stand for the boots to go onto bend to fit a boot better. There are 2 settings for heat and an ozone setting that is quite loud. See video. The ozone feature is to sterilize. The timer is automatically set for 20 minutes and counts down backwards. The unit feels slightly cheap but it does heat up well and it's quite with the ozone feature on. I'll be using it for boots and gloves.
4.0,Nice short; daughter loves it. Looks as it does online. Very pleased overall.
4.0,"Beautiful color red. I love how soft and warm this hat is even in negative degree weather. The biggest plus is that it doesn't make my hair static-y which is amazing! t thought it would be a bit more slouchy since that's what it was called, but it still looks great on me so I don't mind that it's a bit more fitted than expected."
4.0,"The Mizumo logo on the side is very stylish. Nice zipper pockets. Excellent comfort.<br />For pant length 32-36, a Medium is the right size."
4.0,"I was expecting these to have similar material to yoga capris, but they don't. They are thinner and super soft.<br /><br />*I got black and they aren't see though!<br /><br />They are one size. I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs. They fit comfortable but are a little loose in the waist, and super high up on the waist too.  Way over my belly button. Really high up.  But, I can fold it down, which I like so it's not so high.<br /><br />However, since they are a little loose and so high waisted, they are a little baggy/low in the crotch. Nothing like regular exercise pants. Nothing that would probably bother me to much either.<br /><br />Since they are thin, you can see a little underwear line. I would either go commando, try a g-string, or wear a longer shirt.<br /><br />Haven't decided if I dare to wear them as a regular capri yet either. Since they are thinner it just feels like it shows so much. But it probably doesn't."
4.0,Comfortable and like the filter but is a little big for woman‚Äôs face
4.0,I dislike the size confusion cuz it turned out I ordered another ring the same size and this one it's too small
4.0,good wallet - funny smell goes away in about a week.
4.0,well made.  nice case.  a bit dark and skew to vision
4.0,These are amazing! They fit great and they are SO soft!!
4.0,Really liked this nice color
4.0,Ordered as a gift for a friend's new born. Seems like a good quality. Print is adorable and fun.
4.0,It is good but was less sturdy than I was expecting
4.0,Statement piece to give the wow factor to ur whole look.<br />I dint give five stars coz some pearls were missing when it came. Since they don‚Äôt have anymore black color I dint return or replace it.
4.0,"Great quality for the value. Cute looking dress pants that look professional, but also are so incredibly stretchy and comfortable."
4.0,"Super soft, love the color. Fit as expected."
4.0,"haven't washed them yet,  that's the true test on how they hold up. I will update once I do.  So far they look nicely made, good true to color as advised. ( ordered-Grey ) I was skeptical due to lately all clothing I've ordered from Amazon seems to be from a slow boat from over seas :("
4.0,It‚Äôs seemed to stretch a bit over time. It would be better for someone who only wears it some times.
4.0,The bow is huge and very nice quality !<br />The bow is centered rather than off to the side in the picture. Cannot wait to wear to Disney !
4.0,"wife liked it and swim in it, so happy wife happy life."
4.0,Beautiful! A gift for my daughter and she loves it!
4.0,"Nice, soft and very flattering.  Worth the money."
4.0,"I love this shirt, so cute, good fabric but be wary it runs very small, I typically wear a Medium but ordered a Large because other reviews said it runs small, but even the Large is snug. I'd keep it and try to stretch it out but its 100% cotton so don't want to take the chance of shrinking even more. I am hoping I can return and the XL is a better fit."
4.0,It is a little had for people to understand what I am saying with the filter other than that it is the first mask I can breathe in
4.0,"I love the compression, and also the softness of the fabric. Worn under scrubs for work. Would absolutely purchase again."
4.0,"I returned, because it was a bit too cheeky for me. But fit great. For reference, I'm 5'6&#34; 160."
4.0,Cute band but the band keeps opening
4.0,"Im 190 lbs and ordered a large, fits perfectly. Maybe a tiny bit snug. The quality is outrageous. I liked that the front and back are fully sequined. The one I ordered is fully lined and you cant feel the sequins at all.<br />Although, I'm sure my thighs are gonna absolutely rub a lot of the sequins off, it's still a gorgeous item.<br />(And they did, but you can't tell unless you're all up in there.)"
4.0,"Comfortable shoes.  I have a wide forefoot and they fit well.  Good looks, too.  I could do without the zipper, but it seems like no modern sneakers, boots, whatever that is higher than ankle, all have zippers."
4.0,"Such a cute dress! Very feminine. Love the color! I ordered a large, 5‚Äô6‚Äù 170lbs, 36d, curvy/athletic frame. It‚Äôs a little loose in the waist but not that anyone could tell, chest is a smudge tight, but not overly so, a bit loose in shoulders but it all works out. I‚Äôm just being picky. It‚Äôs a beautiful dress, deep v as it says so keep that mind if you‚Äôre trying to keep the girls under wraps. Will definitely buy again!"
4.0,I really like this suit.  Fits well. Like the adjustable straps. Be sure to use the size chart to make sure you get right size.  Only concern is tag says to use non chlorine bleach when washed so I am worried it won't keep its color in a chlorinated pool.
4.0,great summer hat.  price almost doubled in last 2 months
4.0,Don't worry about the reviews. Fits normally.Love it.
4.0,Nice sox - Good Nautical quality
4.0,The coral color is more of a burnt orange...but nice.
4.0,Runs slightly small but great color and stretchability.  I will be wearing it with light jackets and cardigans so it serves a purpose for me.  Thinner fabric so good for layering and warmer days.
4.0,18k plated chunky chain bracelet. Good bracelet with some weight to it so it doesnt feel cheap. The plating is good and I didnt see any chips or missing spots. The clasp is nice and durable and latches well. I like the bracelet for dress up events at work. Nice product with durability and quality. It fit my female wrist just fine without being to tight or large.
4.0,"These have a wonderful rubber end that snugly grabs onto the end of my prescription glasses frames but, because the rubber is not very flexible at the point where the strap enters the grip, I can not fit them into my glasses case anymore. I'll find a larger case. With my household cheaters, I had no problem as the frame portion that rests around the ear is very skinny."
4.0,Looks like the picture. Great for nursing momma's.
4.0,"I initially bought an XL as the sizing said that would be right for an 8 to 10 size. however the top was way too big and the hip didn't lay right as none of the under skirt showed. So I returned it and purchased the large. It's overall a better fit. Stomach area fits, but is not very forgiving. Top is still a little loose for me, but I'll work with it. I have wide shoulders and a wide rib cage, but only a B to C cup size. For reference, I'm 5'5"" and 150 carrying most of the extra weight in my stomach. Very cute dress. Length fits me similarly to the model."
4.0,did not need it but it was pretty
4.0,The flip up clip is small compared to my other sunglasses. Otherwise it is a good sunglass.
4.0,I would say I was really impressed with the quality and how it looks. I ordered size M at first but it's was big around my hip and waist so I returned at got size S. Everywhere fit but around my legs and quads are a bit tight. I appreciate that the waist is not too tight because people need to breath and live but it doesn't compress enough to hide your lower belly.
4.0,"They're ok, definitely go up a size more than what you think or they won't cover your butt"
4.0,COLOR WAS BRIGHTER THAN EXPECTED
4.0,Great gift. Has held up well. Gave 4 stars as it doesn't close all the way around bigger wrists. Still cute though and not a painful pinch by any means
4.0,"Too small for my large face. Otherwise, awesome looking glasses"
4.0,Fit great. Came expedited package when i didnt even ask for it to be. Its a shirt I bought for a concert but its cute enough to wear always.
4.0,Good looking top. Fabric is sturdy and feels good on. It is .well made and I believe will hold up.
4.0,"I really like this bag, the zipper on the inner pocket came broken but that‚Äôs ok, I am going to keep it anyway because it‚Äôs still really cute."
4.0,This shirt is so comfortable it has now become my new favorite (the one I wear too much and the wife yells at me for lack of imagination).
4.0,Very flattering to larger frame
4.0,"careful withe back where the glasses come togehter, it breaks easily."
4.0,"I got this product for my new job because all my jeans have rips in them, and my job requires them to not. The jeans are really nice, they have a great color, a nice stretch to them, and they look great on. The only problem I have with these is the zipper is really cheap. Before putting them on I checked the zipper out of habit. But instantly trying to zip the jeans they kept getting caught. Finally, I was able to zip them so I tried them on. The first thing after putting them on the zipper got caught again. At first, I thought it was because they were too small, but I was able to close them with my hands and still have room without zipping. After a few tries, the zipper broke. I was so upset because I was really excited to wear these. I couldn't fix the zipper because some of the teeth came off as well, very disappointing. But I thought they were so cute so I just wear them buttoned and not zipped with a long shirt to cover the zipper. I would say besides the zipper these are really cute and comfortable jeans, so I say take your chances, it make have just been my jeans that had a bad zipper."
4.0,I love this top! When I saw it I ordered immediately. I ordered a size up to XL as some reviewers noted it ran small. The top fits everywhere except front. It opens up because I am top heavy ( 38 DD). Not sure if I will keep it or not. I can wear a cami or bodysuit underneath but need to see how that looks before deciding. If I do return I will reorder in 2XL because it is super cute!
4.0,"the dress is cute. fits as expected, and as other reviews noted: very stretchy. i typically size up for amazon orders, but this time ordered the closest to my size they had. dress is pretty cheap looking, but good for throwing on for work/another modest event."
4.0,Hard to go wrong.
4.0,My friend love it. The size is just right. The eyes you can see the shine. Recommend
4.0,"While the 1963 chronograph is a great bargain in the world of mechanical chronographs, the accuracy is not the best in the world. Mine runs about +9s a day which is far less accurate than any other automatic or mechanical watch in my collection. Also, the seconds hand sub-dial can be hard to read on at a glance. The fit and finish for the watch is great and the dial is beautiful. The 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clocks catch the light beautifully. The display back is also one of my favorite parts of this watch, seeing the inner workings of the complex movement is astonishing. Overall, the 1963 is a great starter chronograph but lacks the accuracy of more expensive options."
4.0,Excellent addition to my star wars accessory collection.  Feels solid and you can easily take it off the provided rope with crab claw clasp to move it to another chain or rope.  I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a black mando insignia
4.0,As far as quality you get what you pay for
4.0,I like the style and color but found it very large. Guess I ordered the wrong size.
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful dress. The fit is quite comfortable perfect for everyday!!!!
4.0,"Sock worked good, stayed up with minimal swelling of my ankles."
4.0,Took a little bit longer to get than wanted but it seems fairly well made.
4.0,"The tutu was a lot longer than I had anticipated, but I think it did say the length in the description, and I just wasn't paying attention. It came down to my knees. It was a LOT OF TUTU :) It wasn't very easy to drive while wearing it. My friends and I had such a fun time wearing it for pictures during a costume party. I'm sure it will make another appearance at one of our get togethers!"
4.0,"I love this light weight blazer. I needed something to cover up sleeveless shirts for those summer days at the office. This jacket does just that, it's light enough that you won't be sweating in it. I do recommend that you go by the size chart from the manufacturer and not Amazons. I am between a LG and XL, with broad shoulders. For this jacket I had to go with a 2XL and it fit, however I don't think I would be able to wear sleeve shirts with it so I may have to go up a size from that if I wanted to."
4.0,"I bought a 2XL, I‚Äôm a bigger guy but not much. 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 260-270 and the 2XL fits too big honestly"
4.0,This is fairly loose and mega soft wow. I got harem shorts before and just as soft. Love the pockets cool to have a big waist band.
4.0,"I originally bought these for climbing/bouldering.  If you are looking for climbing shorts, try searching for shorts with &#34;4-way stretch&#34; as I found these to be a little restrictive for that purpose.  That being said, I've used these to hike and they are perfect for that purpose.  There are enough pockets to store personal/small items, and the material is light-weight, comfortable, and sturdy."
4.0,"Nice-looking. Fits as expected. Cotton material is mostly comfortable, but gets itchy around the band and side support material when worn overnight or all day."
4.0,Works well for a lace tank
4.0,"Color was not as dark as in picture but it fits nicely. Very lightweight, can be worn with a jacket on top. Material is very soft and comfortable on skin."
4.0,Love style of watch so I ordered 2 watches.<br />The white band watch works fine‚Ä¶LOVE IT!<br />Unfortunately the black band watch (X0015ELVYP) does NOT work‚Ä¶second hand does not move.
4.0,"Adorable, but some are heavy and one came broken and missing Stones, but that's OK. It was the gold one and my least favourite"
4.0,loved the style and the fit<br />wish it came in a lighter color
4.0,"It's an awesome watch especially for littles who are ready to learn what time is, but the strap is not autism friendly. Got it for my oldest who is autistic whose learning time and the strap for him is horrible. To me it's a bit scratchy which is bearable but I'm sure littles would take it off because of that. The watch piece itself is awesome just the band/strap should change to something a bit more comfortable to wear for special needs kids as well as nuetotypical kids. So for the moment he doesn't wear it until I can find a band/strap to change it out too that is more sensory pleasing and durable."
4.0,"Nice quality, but was smaller than I hoped. Love the color and style."
4.0,This was a good coat but it does not look as nice as it's pictured
4.0,"Better than described. Horn is made of metal, so it has nice weight to it. Great size, and a bright shade of blue."
4.0,"A nice cheap, reliable watch to wear for sports and outdoor work."
4.0,Are use this chain on fairly heavy reading glasses.  For the first week the chain did not slip off the glasses.  Since they have slipped off a couple of times this week I'm trying to find the best place to put the rubber ends of the chain on the ends of the glasses.  I really like the design of the chain.
4.0,"I have a small face, so they are a little large for my face. I plan to wear them at home (for reading & sewing), so this doesn't bother me. They are nice for the  $5.00 price tag. The frames are a little thin, but there is no distortion. A pouch, zippered case, & cleaning square are included. I am pleased with this purchase."
4.0,Loved mine until the slide out part broke off. Great coloring tho
4.0,okay to wear...
4.0,"It‚Äôs very pretty & fits well, but I wish the material was of better quality. For the price I paid, I will keep & wear it. It did take me some time & a search in the questions on how to tie it. Lol, felt like a idiot when I found the answer. There‚Äôs a hole on the right to put the belt through. It‚Äôs up a little high & the belt is too short. Had to tie it in the back, not the side like it shows, but it works."
4.0,Material better than some I‚Äôve purchased. A little large but fairly close to stated. Love the embroidery. Much nicer than the printed designs.
4.0,I wear this over another bra to cover the straps for wearing a particular dress. It works just as I needed with the padded cups removed. I wear a 36HH (in UK sizing) and would definitely NOT use this bra for any kind of support; strictly for show. This is constructed with very nice material and washed up wonderfully.
4.0,"Would be GREAT if I lost a few more LBS.<br />I should of almost ordered a size larger, but this one does fit!!"
4.0,Bought for my brother. He liked them.
4.0,"These are terrific little miniatures. They are a great weight, and look very good. The paint isn‚Äôt perfect on all of them, but none is so bad to make them unusable or unappealing."
4.0,"I loved the color and the stretchy material. However, there is a small lining issue around the bust part. Maybe would do better for someone with a smaller bust?<br />(I'm a 38C)"
4.0,This shoes are fun and colorful . They do run a bit small.My toddler wears size 9 and this do fit tight on that size .
4.0,I like the shades but they are a little big for my face.
4.0,"Like the way it fits, comfortable but the color has a pink tint to it. Salmon like, the only thing thats making me consider returning it. But i do like the way it fits and length. I wanted to be able to layer with this piece so it was important to have room"
4.0,I love the dress but because it came from China I expected it small so I bought an xlarge. Too big everywhere. The boobs were huge! But i still love it and it will be easy to alter so I'm keeping it ‚ù§
4.0,"Very nice. Heavier than I anticipated. I wanted something comfortable to wear on long-haul flights that would still look like real pants and not sweats. These are perfect. They are sweats, but look nicer."
4.0,Thing is HUGE! I have biggish hands and it is almost the same size as my hands. I was disappointed when I realized that it was made of plastic but I'll give it a chance. I also ordered the smaller one but that arrives tomorrow (hopefully). I will do a comparison when it arrives. Side note: Designed and made in California!
4.0,Pretty Dress...Ordered Sized Up A Little Big In Shoulders & Arms
4.0,These look great. They really sparkle. I'm still getting used to wearing ear cuffs and getting them to stay upright. I have very small ears. My husband complimented them.
4.0,"I think it's awesome! The only problem I have with it is the band. But, it was easy enough to change out"
4.0,Beautiful bathing suit! Very well-made! Just know there is not a lot to it. You need to have a great body to wear it. Be long-waisted and it probably runs at least two sizes smaller than you would think.
4.0,"Nice top, I wear this to work"
4.0,I normally can wear a medium.. but I usually get a large for a xtra room.. I could have gotten a small in this dress.. the elastic in waist does stretch I can pull it out from my stomach probably 5 inches or more.. a lot of room for hips and breast.. Overall I like it.. it‚Äôs just big
4.0,It is beautiful but very tiny.  I will enjoy wearing it but it is tiny.
4.0,"These are so cute, but I was a little sad because they were not as tight as I wanted them. But I'm rlly small so I expected this anyway."
4.0,These boots are just adorable as pictured. Also very comfortable as I can work 8-12 hour shifts in them. Delivered faster than expected as well.
4.0,Overall decent watch for the price. As others have said the bracelet can pinch or get caught in arm hairs. Needed to have a couple links removed. Bracelet was fitted for Arnold Schwarzenegger's big arms.
4.0,"good quality product, like them all"
4.0,"There is no 'easy-on' to these socks. They are just like any other support socks, but then, that is the nature of support socks. They are suppose to be tight and hard to get on. But once I do get them on, they feel very supportive."
4.0,"I purchased these for my outdoor event. The large base that some people have found unattractive didn't bother me at all. No one noticed that I had them unless I pointed them out. I wish that there was something inside where the heel of the shoe goes that would provide extra grip to the heel. I definitely had them fall off a couple of times. But beyond the occasional falling off and putting back on, I was pretty pleased. I can say that I did not end up poking holes in the ground with my shoes :)!"
4.0,looks like a nice sweatshirt
4.0,"Nice light weight vest...true to size, but this red color is a little pinkish, not a true red."
4.0,Battery life varies
4.0,These help with clean up big time. I should of gotten them sooner. Works as expected
4.0,"Pretty much as expected. Little smaller than expected, especially in the hood."
4.0,good looking n most important thing is that it works
4.0,Just wish the dress had no ridden up during the evening. Looked great on and nice material. Great price.
4.0,"Cute shoes! My daughter loves them. As I saw in another review they do run a lil wider than expected, but not as wide as a wide shoe would be. Its enough room to wear socks or stockings...."
4.0,"I really liked this dress. I read the reviews, checked the size chart and ordered a XL, I am big chested. In the boob area I should of sized up because when I sat down my boobs went everywhere but while I was standing the dress was fine. I liked the length, the way it fit and the material was nice. I will probably get me another one."
4.0,Love this dress. Make sure that you have a slip to go under it because it is very sheer.  Fits to size and very slimming.
4.0,Super cute would have gave 5 stars but it was thinner than expected
4.0,Great scarf very soft but the color isn‚Äôt quite the same. It‚Äôs more beige than off white
4.0,Buena relaci√≥n calidad/precio. Muy c√≥modas para hacer ejercicio.
4.0,"Nice. Very Nice. They come in a handsome gift box. They are the softest thing my Hubby will let get next to him. He has this thing about not getting wimpy. When he tried these on he fell in love. They are so very warm with the lamb's wool inside and fit good. They are a little bigger than we thought but I was actually going to use them, now they are his. I lost this pair of leather gloves without even getting to wear them. Ugh!. Of course I forgot till them came I also am allergic to wool, breaks me out.Good news they are a very dressy look  so you can wear them out anyplace but  wouldn't work in them. They deserve better than that.. Now for testing screens that was hard, even though it picks up movement...your fingers are to fat for it to be of a lot of use, no precise actions.You can make a phone call, start or stop unlocking it . So we just rated them on the luxury and wear ability.That was great. Good gift perfect for driving. IN EXCHANGE for my true impartial review, my own findings, I received this Promotional Item at no cost.***"
4.0,This is one of my favorite dresses in my wardrobe for everyday wear. I love the feel of it on my skin and it's easy to care for. What I most love about it is how versatile it is. I feel as comfortable in it around the house as I do going out to enjoy a meal or nightlife.
4.0,Somewhat of a tighter fit. Lovely design.
4.0,I was angry at first because the dress was different. The sleeves were different and the design was different. Completely different dress. Why did I give it four stars? Because I look fabulous in it and it is true to fit. It is still very beautiful up close and far away. I ordered a large because I'm a size 12. Everything is awesome!!! Look at my pictures.
4.0,I don't know if its just me but after I received the product the metal part of the bracelet looks smaller in real life. but its well made and very comfortable.
4.0,Silver paint was chipped off in places and had to be fixed before wearing it
4.0,they fit a little loose.<br />the cotton has a good thickness.
4.0,I find they keep moving down on my face. My husband has no problems. I wear hearing aids. I thought these as masks would be better. So I would figure it would be good for some head sizes but not as good as for others.
4.0,"This is a very cute dress. Unfortunately, the sleeves are very long. I will have to hem them before I wear it but overall, a cute dress"
4.0,"I like the product, I wish there was protection from leakage onto the shirt."
4.0,Beautiful earrings. One of my new favorite pair of earrings.
4.0,"I like the watch very much and find it comfortable to wear, but I was disappointed in the lack of a magnet in the band"
4.0,"I ordered these multiple times and really enjoyed making projects with them. They came in a timely manner, all accounted for and in good condition. The only issue I had, which was not a deal breaker at all, was some of the base coat of paint did not provide good coverage on some of the masks but you will probably be painting them anyway. I had great results with glitter spray paint. Just spray lightly, let dry then spray again otherwise it will look like the painting is ‚Äúmelting‚Äù."
4.0,"Umbrellas are umbrellas, but this one is a beautiful decorative women's umbrella.<br /><br />This is a very long umbrella that she'll have to carry either in her hand or in a large bag.<br /><br />I would say, that it can cover two medium size people or one large person.<br /><br />The only thing that I have a question about is the handle.  The handle is hollow and is held to the frame by glue.<br />But, after opening and closing a few times, it seems alright.<br /><br />We just went through several weeks of intense rain after a long drought but if this doesn't hold up, I'll revise this review.<br /><br />Product furnished for public review by seller."
4.0,"The hat didn‚Äôt change from years ago , good."
4.0,"I really like this stretchy belt because you can adjust it. The belt I received is designed to fit 22-46 inches. Because of those dimensions, I was skeptical regarding the fit. I was pleasantly surprised. I really like this belt."
4.0,"The panties fit my granddaughter however, since she has a little bit of extra in the rear they didn't pull up over the tummy as I much as I would have liked them to. Other than that, the prints are pretty and the material was heavier than most which made the feel very pleasing. I also liked the reinforced band around the legs."
4.0,I love it. But iphone has headphone output down and only works with those hanging.
4.0,Lovely dress. I found this the arm section to be a little snug.
4.0,Perfect to dress up your finger nail but not for what I intended it. I was hoping to use it a temporary prosthetic for my missing finger tip but the shape of the nail jewelry is not realistic. Maybe with some crafting I can reshape/ widen it. Who knows maybe you can start a new trend
4.0,"These are good for the price. They do run a little large. I usually wear a 7 - 7.5 wide and sometimes an 8 regular; I needed some heel grips to keep these from slipping (8 regular). They don't have a lot of traction, so be sure that these are for rain only....not snow or ice."
4.0,it actually looked better on model than me.
4.0,a little on small side
4.0,"They are great, comfy and cheap.<br /><br />I don't like how the color looks more like a pretty dark grey."
4.0,The earrings are pretty but very light weight.  Already lost one because they are not heavy enough to stay in your ears well.
4.0,Does not provide back support for what I purchased it for.
4.0,These are as expected. My only concern is that my son wears a 5 and i bought the six and its alot of room but it works because once he closes the strap the sandal doesn't fall off his feet
4.0,I DO LIKE SOFT AND COLOR
4.0,Love this really pretty
4.0,The neck didn't fit as tight as I would have liked.
4.0,5 &#34;2 with fairly big thighs and they reach just above my knee.
4.0,Very comfortable:)
4.0,"Great hat.Kelan, helmet heads son wears this hat alot. Kelan don't grow up to be a cheating cry baby like your father Kevin.Kelan told his father  you can keep your helmet on,but take off those granny glasses."
4.0,"runs small, I gave to my mother. I love the color."
4.0,"A bit wider than I was expecting, but overall I really like it. Feels durable but soft, and fits all of the contents of my old wallet without issue."
4.0,The material isnt as soft as I hoped but I could wear it before I got pregnant and during my pregnancy
4.0,Didn't notice country of origin. Disappointed.
4.0,Served its purpose for my friend's 40th bday!
4.0,"reasonable quality, just doesn't fit westerners, sizes run very small"
4.0,"The bandanas serve the purpose of covering the face quickly when out and about. However, they are thin so not to be used as a disease protection mask. The ear tabs feel comfortable."
4.0,I hated the way they fit
4.0,I am fast becoming a fan of Comfelie bras. This is my 2nd one and I really like it. The fabric is incredibly soft and supple. No pinching or bulging. Nice thick straps that don't dig into the skin. Comfortable for all day wear. Very satisfied!<br />-<br />*Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps make your decision easier.*
4.0,Good tie for the price. Pretty good material. Ties decently well.
4.0,"Nice quality, runs a little big"
4.0,"Very good price, nice people, would recommend buying it."
4.0,Decent quality strap with great elasticity without being too tight. Not bad at all
4.0,"Material is much more thin than expected, but very comfortable"
4.0,"Though these precious fuschia (hot pink) shoes ran too small and I had to return them, they are really adorable shoes. In addition the price is quite affordable for a girls dressy shoe plus shipping was fast and when I requested a return it went through immediately and smoothly with no issues whatsoever. My suggestion is to size up and they should be fine as long as your child‚Äôs foot is not on the wider side, like my granddaughter‚Äôs, cause they do run somewhat narrow."
4.0,I like the size is good. I am 5'3&#34; 133lbs but short for sure!
4.0,Last longer if used indoors
4.0,This set is huge. It comes with just about any stud you could even want. I split these with my daughter and we have enough for probably a lifetime of little earrings. They are decent quality and work for every day use. It‚Äôs a good value if you want daily studs to wear that you don‚Äôt mind if you happen to lose one.
4.0,"nice costume piece; however, smaller than anticipated. will work perfectly for my 7 yo son (since is a present for him) but i couldn't see this as a &#34;true-to-life&#34; piece for an adult male costume. i know my son will be ecstatic to receive & price is reasonable."
4.0,I'm hoping that this piece will mellow with age and become less shiny.  It has a very good weight for the price.  I'll keep it.
4.0,"These are great!  I wish they were available in other colors, I'd have a whole set."
4.0,"Fabric was a little thicker than I expected based on the pictures, but this dress is cute and very flattering, and doesn't wrinkle easily."
4.0,Great traveling purse.  Lots of hidden pockets.  My only complaint is the string is unattractive and might look better as a thin leather strap.
4.0,Decent quality for the price. My daughter is over the moon to dress up like Elsa!
4.0,"I give it 4 stars,  love the bottom they fit perfectly,<br /> but the top is way too big, too bad they don't sell them separately or let you exchange either top or bottom to get the right fit"
4.0,I bought these lenses for my Wiley-X Brick sunglasses and the lenses fit okay. Inserting them was pretty simple but there is a bit of movement once in place. If the wind is blowing heavy you can actually see the lenses shaking around in the frames. One person told me while we were having a conversation that it looked like my lens was going to fall out. That was a little embarrassing.
4.0,"Lo largo del collar, me gusta."
4.0,"I liked it, but it broke when my kids were swinging my keys around. :("
4.0,"I have another pair of riding gloves in small, and these are definitely bigger. Probably should have gotten small. Nevertheless, they are comfortable and attractive. No real complaints."
4.0,"Came wayyyyy late (like 2 weeks late) and a little too big, but it's a very nice swimsuit"
4.0,"Beautiful boots,I am gonna wear them even though they r small for me,but am loving them,just order a 1/2 larger ur size."
4.0,"Nice hat, doesn't breath, so maybe a little hot in the summer."
4.0,"This bra is good for walking or light movement,but this did not give me the support I need for running."
4.0,True too picture
4.0,Not as cute as the pictures but ok.
4.0,But It is OK.  Ver nice.
4.0,"The dress is amazing !!!!! The dress arrived very quickly, and I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality. I have to go to a ball in the next couple of months and will be ordering another dress"
4.0,"The look great, feel pretty good. Noticed a slight difference in one sole than the other, one has a bit more cushion - but I planned on getting new insoles anyways. No other major quality defects noticed. Solid buy!<br /><br />I‚Äôll be doing an update on durability. I work in a mill so, they will go through some rough work.<br /><br />UPDATE 1 week use: Shoes holding up well, walking through puddles no wet feet. Shoes are very comfortable, I‚Äôd compare them to Nike SB comfort! Con is that they do not breath well, feet are sweating often, stinky feet. Oh well."
4.0,Very nice not true to size
4.0,Amazing !...ts was as It was expected.
4.0,"Its a good wallet however, i will say it is prettttty BIG. Like probably a half inch longer and wider than a standard wallet. For example, the ID part of the wallet has so much extra space, its kinda odd. it makes a big difference. It is a great wallet tho for any assassin creed fan, just a weee too big for me."
4.0,"I ordered a Small and I'm 5'5"", 140lbs, 32D, 36-27-41.  The dress looked great!  It was a bit roomy for me in the bust and waist, and I needed to add some padding to the bust.  The hem hit several inches above my knee, so it's definitely a mini.  Loved the aqua color, which is a bit lighter than my photo shows.  Compared to my real Herve Leger bandage dresses, this dress is a bit lighter weight and not quite as firm or snug, but it's a nice, inexpensive alternative.  I do NOT recommend sizing up - the dress fits and controls your figure best when it's very tight; that's just how these bandage dresses are designed.  You may need someone to help zip you up, but once zipped, it's comfortable and moves easily with your body."
4.0,This coat seems to be very well made and should protect against very cold weather.  Color is as described and it arrived well packaged and on time.
4.0,These leggings are almost perfect. They are stretchy and comfortable.  They made my belly pooch look smaller. The pockets are functional.  The fit is true to size. My only complaint is that the rear pockets are too far apart and makes my butt look wide. It might just be the pair I received so I still say try them.
4.0,They were not as stretchy as I would have liked but they are very warm.
4.0,"Material was a little different than expected, but it fits great and I like the way it looks."
4.0,"I love the shape and style but normally when ordering Body glove I have to order 1 size up so that I can actually breathe/function in their swim suits. their rash guards usually are skin tight and I have previously owned large bottoms and tops in body glove and have been satisfied with the fit.  I assume that this one has a little more room because of the cut being more modest. I'm 29 yo  5'8&#34; female 150-160 lbs on average, with 34C, and I would say that I have a slight bit more room in my Body Glove Large bottoms than I do in the large top.  Not enough though that I want to exchange for a medium"
4.0,"I took a chance and ordered this dress knowing that according to the size chart, I'm at the high end of their largest size. But I figured the material is stretchy so maybe I could make the X-large work.  I'm 5'4&#34;, about 174 lbs., and a 38DDD.  I'm actually quite happy with the look. It does fit snug, but I might be comfortable wearing it out on a simple dinner date. More than likely, I'll end up wearing it over leggings with some thigh-high boots. It really is a cute little dress and you can't beat the price.  I'll upload a photo."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a bit tight in the chest area but in general, I really like it."
4.0,They are worm their really good the only thing I'm short in 5 feet they are to long I have to be folding a lot
4.0,"I like it. Gave it 4 stars because the skirt is transparent and the top is like a bra. After reading reviews I got a small (i know right) but a medium (my true size 6/7) would have been better. It‚Äôs nice but a tad too fitted for my taste, I may return for a M. If I keep it, I‚Äôd wear an oversized sweater to cover my butt. It‚Äôs slim to the ankles on me but still room to move. I got the red. Comfy material. Band didn‚Äôt bother my stomach.<br /><br />149lbs 5‚Äô3 36-27-43 (Give or take 1-2in) curvy, petite"
4.0,Nice sexy tee!
4.0,"The clasp and links come off a little too easily, but they're easily remolded into place, and it will flatter any neck."
4.0,I bought the 17 pocket vest for a trip to Alaska where I did not want to take my purse. The vest was a purse substitute and it worked great.  It is somewhat over engineered in many of the smaller pockets were useless; however the iPhone pocket and ear bud holders were great. I carried a pen on one of the long narrow pockets and eye liner pencil in the other. The passport pocket and credit card pockets were winners. The major pockets were great so I was very satisfied over all. The one gripe I had was the back cargo area it only went down a few inches. I had underwear and a sleeping tee shirt for the cruise in case my luggage was late. It hit me just above the small of my back and was very uncomfortable sitting on the airplane!!  Not happy with that. My husbands evest had a much bigger back cargo pocket that went all the way down. In all I weigh 130# and am 5'3&#34; and large was great fully loaded.  The serious knock I have is back cargo area. Additionally a two way front zipper would be a serious plus. Sitting with a loaded vest would be better w a two way zipper. Get this vest for the best price you can find. I paid $80 After shopping around.
4.0,Like advertising
4.0,Could have left out the days of the week.
4.0,I really love these leggings! They are comfortable and cute enough to wear outside of the gym. I would definitely buy again. I took away one star because unfortunately you can see through them a little when you bend down. It's not bad enough for me to stop wearing them though!
4.0,"Too large for my son, but perfect for my husband."
4.0,Decent glasses. Adds nice blue hue to everything. Not polarized but that's no big deal. Fits me fine for the price which was discounted for review.
4.0,Good gym slipper
4.0,"I had the old 5610, and wanted this one. It would be the perfect G Shock if alarms were not important. You can barely hear them. I use alarms, so I wear my 5600 on my wrist much more. Still going to keep it. Nice watch, but not 5 stars."
4.0,"It's an adorable skirt, lightweight material. I loved the rouge side on it creating the asymmetrical shape in the front."
4.0,"Overall I liked this dress but it was a little bit too long. I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 120 lbs and bought a small. It fit nicely (fitted style) but looked too conservative for my taste because of the length. The model in the pictures must be taller than me since the dress covered my knees. Also, the pink leafy pattern is very pink, more like bubblegum or almost neon pink. Looks more like light pink in the pictures. I returned it."
4.0,weight and appearance are perfect but it would be better if the clasp was more easily handled single handed.
4.0,The heart is less pretty than in the pic.
4.0,"I bought this for a party we went to and was overall very pleased. The fit was accurate with the description, and happy the way this dress conforms. The material is good quality but I will say it's not lightweight and found it does creep down because of the weight so I did have to keep adjusting it up in the waist and leg. The colors are vibrant and and besides having to adjust the look a few times I was happy overall"
4.0,This is a nice suit. It is low cut but not to much. It is very tight so I would go up a size. I believe they tell you that with Miracle Suits anyway.
4.0,I like that there are extra straps and 4 different places to hook the strap on the sides. Also the crotch latch is adjustable and it is very soft. Very nice and soft material. Gets the job done nicely!
4.0,Perfect and lightweight! I get lots of complements!
4.0,Excellent product but next time please remove the anti theft device you guys left on the socks. I had a hell of a time trying to get that thing off using a multi tool to cut it off without damaging the socks.
4.0,"Gorgeus booties, however they are quite small compared to my other Aldo shoes of the same size."
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous. I'll be returning it though. It runs very large. I have a really large chest, and it was too baggy there. I was hoping it would be tighter. It flows really pretty and is a nice lightweight fabric. There is no lining on the top, only a skirt lining. I have a wedding tomorrow, so I'll be returning. I usually wear a 16 and got the XXL. I'm 5'8&#34;. I could have easily gotten the XL or maybe even the L."
4.0,"The watch is pretty, BUT the watch itself stopped working in a super short time, such as less than 6 months."
4.0,"Very cute and comfy, but slightly smaller than I expected.  I ordered an XXL and it was tighter in the arms than I'd like, and it wasn't as roomy as I would have hoped.  The flowers need to be constantly ironed because ONE wash and they'll be all curled up and won't look anything like flowers anymore.  Overall, I like the sweater, just wish it was a tad bigger and not as delicate."
4.0,"These are really pretty!  They are great earrings for a special occasion and will add a glamorous touch to any outfit.  They are surprisingly lightweight and do not pull at my piercings and earlobes as some heavier earrings tend to do.  The gold metal is more champagne than yellow.  Not brassy at all.  The miniature stones grab just the right amount of light to keep things looking classy and not gaudy.  The leaf design is gorgeous and interesting to look at, and the teardrop is flexible and hangs via a hinge on the underside of the leaf.  It gives the earrings a bit of give which makes them comfortable to wear.  The price is a bit high for the quality of the pair but they can definitely be worth it if they're meant for a special event."
4.0,"Great design and all, the fabric is a little scratchy though."
4.0,The navy color is lighter than the photo. Overall it is what $15 would pay for..a simple light summertime bag.
4.0,Wore it to Church today. Very nice
4.0,This unicorn horn is gorgeous! I love it! A little bit too big for kids but works well for me. The flowers are made out of cheap material but none have fallen out yet. The veil in the back has very pretty colors and is pretty stiff but will still flow.
4.0,"I ordered two pair because I loved the first pair but was disappointed with the second pair the hem was longer on one leg by two inches. Needles to say I was very disappointed I will have to get them altered, but this was off set by the fit of the other pair. I recommend these pants they have a great fit and are nice and thick great for cold weather."
4.0,"Overall very nice, just a tad see through but not awful.  Great cruise dress but tan a tad on the small side."
4.0,This necklace is Shiny and very pretty. I bought this for my niece for her birthday and she loves it. Great gift ideal for girls age 9 to 16.
4.0,Beautiful but way to small. Gave it away!
4.0,18 mil bands were larger than my 18 mil strap. One of these things is not like the others....
4.0,"I am enjoying my new wallet.  I ordered the gold and it is a very nice color.  It's a compact wallet & doesn't hold a lot of coins, but still worth the purchase.  It's a little hard to get cards out of the slots, though."
4.0,Truly lightweight and breathable for Phoenix Summer!
4.0,"I love these nose rings.  Simple, inexpensive and pretty.  It was hard to get the first one in because the gage was large."
4.0,Great for cycling no issues riding up or quality issues
4.0,Prior to buying these I was VERY skeptical about the reviews regarding the sizing. I purchased the size I wear XL and I was pretty pleased with the fit. Tested them out on a 10 mile ride today. The padding was incredible & covered my entire booty. The pocket was reasonably sized but didn't fit my iPhone 6+(not that I expected it to). Hopefully they'll last in the was but GREAT VALUE for price. May just grab another pair (or two)
4.0,"Pretty dress, nice material. It was too small for my daughter and she is a perfect size 12. If you order this dress, you may consider ordering at least 2 sizes larger. I sent it back and was  refunded my money quickly."
4.0,"These shirts are a good value for the price and the fit great. Only complaint is the material seems to be a little abrasive, can cause a little skin irritation after a while. Not great but good."
4.0,"smaller than anticipated, but i get lots of compliments on them"
4.0,This skirt is cute and fits great! I ordered a large.
4.0,"It's nice and have pretty good weight to it. Even though I much prefer if they make this with Sterling silver. But can't find it, so this is the second best"
4.0,"Real nice mala beads, very pretty a nice charms on them. I only wish they were adjustable since 4 loops is too loose and 5 is too tight."
4.0,They are very cute and do indeed glow obviously your have to either hold you tongue out under a light or be under a black light.  They are a bit uncomfortable and I don't recommend eating with them but they are very cute atheistically
4.0,it for my husband birthday want know until next week.
4.0,Very casual and comfortable top.  The  Price very good for value.  Small is very roomy.  I am a size 2.
4.0,Really love these earrings! They were easy to put on even though they‚Äôre so delicate. They catch the light and are truly stunning. Only cons - the bar at the end is crooked on one of them and the stone is completely clear on one while cloudy on the other. These things are barely noticeable when they‚Äôre on and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them out.
4.0,I like it but it snags my clothes often!!
4.0,"Thin fabric, fits small."
4.0,"5'-4"" and weight ~120 pounds. I typically wear a US Size 2 or a small in similar women's styles. I ordered the CHIC.U  1950's Vintage Floral Spring Garden Party Picnic Dress Party Cocktail Dress in a size Large based on the provided dimensions from the seller. The Large is WAY TOO BIG on me! I am returning the Large and am waiting for a Small to ship. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ORDERING YOUR NORMAL US SIZE. The dress, although wide, is a great conservative style for the workplace during the summer months. This is a timeless style that will continue to be a staple of any woman'should wardrobe. The wide sleeves offer enough coverage to avoid needing a sweater or jacket over the top. The skirt hits mid-calf and is an appropriate length for work or a date with my husband. I would definitely wear this dress to work on a day when I know I am going out to dinner with my husband. The A-Line design is flattering for women of any shape and size. I can't wait to get this dress in the right size and wear it to work! I will post an update on the fit once my new dress arrives.<br /><br />The style of the dress is exactly as photographed by the seller. The material is a lightweight cotton.  It is soft against the body. The hems and seams of the dress are all very well constructed and smooth. They do not irritate. I ordered this dress in a white print. It is lined, to avoid any unsightly see-through mishaps! It includes a tie at the waist, making it easier to fit your body without a trip to the tailor or seamstress. The cotton material is easy care in the washing machine. It washes and dries on normal cycle.<br /><br />Despite my trouble finding the right size originally, I love the style of this dress. It is chic and classic, yet conservative enough to wear to work. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new addition to their daily work wardrobe. It ships quickly and since it is Prime eligible, is easy to return in the event that the fit is not correct. I recommend ordering your normal US size (disregard the measurements from the seller). This dress makes a great gift for the friends, girlfriends, wives and moms in your life. I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you[...]"
4.0,"The chain was shorter than I thought it would be, but it still fits over the rear view mirror."
4.0,Got this today. I love the style. Im a very picky person when it comes to styles. The band below the bra line is awesome and the flow of the dress hides my waist handles. Its very sexy and casual at the same time. Im 5'8 and got the xxl its a bit snug but i can still move. The fabric is not cotton and you will sweat if you wear this on summer time. Its like a heavy satin fabric i dont know what its called but thats how it feels like to me. The dress i received has no tag or label.
4.0,"runs a lil small, sits on your hips...but overall material is great and just like any other North Face, i love it!"
4.0,"Product was smaller than I expected, but it is really cute.<br />My Son plans to gift his girlfriend on their anniversary the end of the month."
4.0,"This shoe is a little tight on front, it hurts my bit toes.  Not as comfortable as the other Cole Haan ballets."
4.0,a little tight to get on but still sexy to use
4.0,"Comfy but oddly, the sleeve caps have shrunk. Only the sleeve caps. Fit elsewhere is fine and isn‚Äôt annoying while sleeping, so I guess it‚Äôs fine? Not a bad buy."
4.0,"3X-Large fits fine, European not American Sizing .<br />XX-Large too tight for me, bought because no 3X-Large avaialable<br />Me I'm difficult to find a shirt that fits me. I'm 6', 230 lbs, with 36"" arms. Usually when I buy a shirt that covers my arms it fits like a sack. not the case with this shirt. This shirt is by far the most functionally superior work shirt that I have bought,<br />What I like:<br />- I can wear it untucked<br />- Fabric lightweight but tough<br />- Nearly has a sheen but it doesn't<br />- Cleans easy doesn't seem to shrink<br />-100% cotton, I do not like synthetics<br />- Doesn't retain heat so good for NWFL hot and humid conditions<br />What I dislike:<br />- Left pocket too small for much, I can almost shove my Samsung Galaxy S-8 in a wallet<br />- Not keen on the zipper looks kinda wrong, sorry, I would not buy this if its function and fit didn't exceed other shirts I would not buy it.<br />- Not keen on the big embroidered name on the pocket, if you want me to wear your name pay me for it, again if the function was not outstanding I would pass on this shirt<br />Sep 9, 2020; Update still a great workshirt, I have not found one better. Right pocket does not hold anything other than paper anything like a key etc. will fall out. Grrrrrrr. Needs hook and loop from the bottom to keep stuff in the pocket."
4.0,Love the fit and the length is perfect.
4.0,Heavier than I expected but fine fit my need
4.0,The concept is great and it does work. The strings are long enough for you to cut at desired length. I just didn‚Äôt like how they looked on me but I‚Äôll definitely consider for kids who can‚Äôt find velcro shoes and can‚Äôt tie their shoes.
4.0,It's a bit SHORTHER and WIDER than what is pictured. Im a large and I bought a large. . . and it fits me like it should. I can leave it out or tuck it into my pants and it still looks good. The material is comfortable. would definitely purchase again.
4.0,I really love this coat. Like REALLY love it! I was expecting it to run small- but I would say it actually runs true to size. I ordered a large and probably actually needed a sm/med. I was able to move a button over so that it fit my waist snug which made it look even more skirted which I love. It is SO warm and the perfect coat if you are wanting to look a little dressy.
4.0,It works good for the hobby work that I do that is dusty.The tie strings are a little thin and sometimes hard to get untied.
4.0,"Though I was expecting a little thicker/less spandex of a material, it is cute and comfortable. I am bummed out that I bought it at my size, it's just a little too big which makes the waist-line a little wonky.<br />Worth the price and the shipping was super fast which is extremely appreciated. Will more than like buy from them again. Just keep in mind the sizing"
4.0,"A bit girlie for my son, but comfy socks."
4.0,I‚Äôve worn these for the past several years. This is my third pair. Love them. The only problem 2 of them broke in the exact same place on the strap.
4.0,"Fit is generous, but works with the style. Material is soft and flows nicely. My concern is the material might be too heavy for warmer weather, but we'll see. I can definitely wear it here due to our moderate climate."
4.0,Shorts are nice‚Ä¶hate the pockets
4.0,"LOVE the simple elegance I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, size 8. This is one size fits all and has plenty now of extra room for someone curvier but still hugs me just right. Hits just about mid calf.  Teeeny bit itchy, but I plan to wear it with a long john top under it on cold days. Ordered the blackThinking I want the cream too!"
4.0,I love the style and feel.
4.0,Smaller then I expected but does what I wanted it to.  I often have long blouses I like to dress up and this does the trick.
4.0,Fit great! A nice look with a dressy or casual outfit
4.0,Nice shirts for the price.
4.0,I expected the shorts to be the same type as shown in the picture for sale. they look cooler online but im still going to wear them
4.0,"Love how pliable these shoes are, not stiff out of the box at all. The elastic band on top of the shoe makes it hard to get on my child foot as she has a high top arch on her feet."
4.0,"Best part about these masks ...No fogging on your eye glasses , plus I do not feel like I‚Äôm speaking into a pillow like other masks. They are thinner then expected but no complaints."
4.0,Had to trim a bit with my exacto knife to fit my older watch.
4.0,"Well, 60 days in and the pin fell out! However, after the manufacturer reached out to me about the issue, and several attempts and &#34;proving&#34; the item was defective, they replaced it at no charge, glad to know they stand behind their products, just wish it had been an easier process. Better than a broken watch! lol"
4.0,My daughter ordered this dress for me and I received it today.<br />I was amazed as to how beautiful this dress is.<br />This fit was perfect on the lower half of my body and the only reason  why I did not give is a 5 star is because  the upper part of the dress at the chest was a a little  loose.  It will take me no time to adjust  myself.<br />The material  not thin or see through .<br />Thanks  Allegra k Please  make more dresses like this one.<br />P.s. the price  was very reasonable.<br />Janet
4.0,"Great for a girl unicorn fan. Long sleeve can be worn in 3 of the seasons, just add leggings for winter"
4.0,Flattering tight fit. The dry fit works well when I‚Äôm lifting weights. I do not wear this tank while running because it chafes the skin on my triceps.  My Nike dry fit tanks don‚Äôt do that.
4.0,Me gusto es una tela bien comoda y bonita
4.0,Husband loves them!!
4.0,It's a bit large
4.0,"Keep your head warm this winter with a stylish new hat. With sub zero wind chill, even women who do not like wearing hats need them. So why not make it fun and fashionable."
4.0,"We recently bought a similar set for myself, and my wife loving it wanted one for her. This one came in and she was so excited, but immediately felt a bit disappointed.<br /><br />While this gloves and hat set are nice and warm, they are a bit rougher than your normal fabric, and they didn't have a liner inside like the other set that I had bought. They were similarly priced, so I really kind of expected a similar feel.<br /><br />Overall, there is nothing wrong with these, but they aren't as soft as we expected, however will serve their purpose just fine."
4.0,"These fangs were realistic looking.  They are a little large/long so if you have to wear them more than one day/night, they might start to hurt your gums. The 'glue' that comes with the fangs did not work at all, so plan on investing in some denture cream or something like it to get the fangs to stay in place.  Overall a good purchase for the inexpensive price."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:efdfaa8778a51aae048225be7d878c4a]] mine came in an already opened and re-taped bag.<br />the little scarfs look very cute, soft to touch with nice colored patterns.<br />one of the scarf has a little flaw."
4.0,Enjoy the rings. Like the different choices.
4.0,I love the colors and the design.  But the fit was very strange.  Around my shoulders and arms it is a little snug and that is not a material that you want to be snug.  The arms are very long.  I may have to return it because I know and XXL will be too big.  Have to see what my options are.
4.0,"The top is amazing but the swim bottoms are huge...still, its gorgeous and comfortable"
4.0,"Its AMAZING for anyone, who wants a somewhat cheap backpack for school and such. ALTHOUGH, the laptop compartment does NOT fit my 15 inch laptop.... I am not going to cry about it tho"
4.0,"I got these to go under v-neck shirts and dresses to 1) be a little more modest and 2) allow for more discrete breastfeeding. They‚Äôre great for both of those things! I love how high the lace comes up (you could adjust the straps down to make it a little lower than I‚Äôm wearing it) and how incredibly soft the fabric is. They are very thin and clingy, which is totally fine for how I‚Äôm using them, but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt want to wear one by itself. Also, one of mine arrived damaged. I can probably fix it, and the other two are fine, so I‚Äôm keeping them, but the lace is coming off of the gray one, which is disappointing (see pictures).<br /><br />I was originally planning to cut and re-hem them into crop tops so I could pull them up to breastfeed more easily, but they‚Äôre so thin that I think I should be able to just bunch it up under the rouched waistline of the dress I‚Äôm wearing it with and it should be okay. Then when I‚Äôm done nursing, I can still wear them :)"
4.0,Just like new.
4.0,"Nice overall and comfortable for the cost, but does run a little small."
4.0,very comfortable. My only issue is that the straps are too much in the front
4.0,"I have received several compliments when I  wear it. Plus...it saves me so much time, I know we're I put my glasses:-]"
4.0,Just received this.  Shipping very prompt and it looks like a quality product.  It is for my granddaughter's birthday so will not know how it holds up until she uses it.
4.0,"I am a newly nursing mom and bought this for comfort and easy access to the breasts for my baby. It is a great buy.  I would just suggest sizing up because when I bought it in my regular size fit snugly, so I returned it and sized up.  I also read reviews that it will shrink after wash."
4.0,Its okay but i dont think it will last long.
4.0,Great material for travel! Doesn‚Äôt shrink.
4.0,Slightly heavier than what I thought. I like how small it is and it comes with a pretty bag.
4.0,I wore this to South Carolina in August and felt cool and breezy. Very good cover up at the arm holes [ not tight] and covers the girls without feeling Amish. I would of given 5 stars if there where more color choices.
4.0,Looks awesome but fits a little tight.
4.0,I purchased in all three colors.  My only issue was mine had a strange smell when I opened them.  I wash all three on delicate with Woolite.  Have to reference the pics to figure out how to wear it.
4.0,"Yes, they are functional, but it's at the expense of being warm.  But it's worthwhile tradeoff unless you are in extremely cold weather."
4.0,"Good purse rack, love that I can adjust the hooks where they need to be. Perfect for keeping your purses organized and in one view. Not great for purses with thick straps."
4.0,I washed them and the knot came off and now there just ugly and weird üò≠
4.0,"Quality of charms was very good, nice size and weight but I was shorted 9 charms and I needed 100 for my event.  How do I get the shortage replaced without buy more?"
4.0,"Fits great, light weight and easy to match with other pieces."
4.0,"The shoes are very good, the size is a little large, but fine."
4.0,Looks just like the picture but not true to size. A size 4 is about a size 6.
4.0,"Wish it was not crop, great fit otherwise"
4.0,"Kinda thin , but not too thin.  I really like them.  I split the package with my friend and he REALLY loves them."
4.0,Nice scarf . Wish it was a bit thicker like a real scarf. So it would be worth wearing all the time not just Halloween . It‚Äôs thin is all
4.0,the sleeves are little short for how small I am so you will want to watch that.
4.0,I really enjoyed it because it was stainless steel  so it didn't break me out will order a couple more in june.
4.0,Good very sexy
4.0,"These are very comfortable socks. They are made of mostly cotton which explains why they are so soft in my eyes. The rest, around 25% in total are out of synthetic material, which allows for the elastic abilities as well as some of the moisture wicking and such. They are nice ankle cut that are very comfortable. The brown is a very nice dark brown that go great with jeans but also more formal pants. These are true to size. They don't have any special support or anything, just regular comfortable socks."
4.0,"I love this jacket - buyt way too small!  I am 5' 8.5&#34; and 145 lbs.  I ordered the large but this jacket is very short for my frame.  I'm disappointed because I love the jacket, just wish it was longer."
4.0,It is a very pretty suit although the sleeves are not Bell sleeves they're straight. There are also little pearls attached all over the top which you can't see in the picture which kind of makes it a little cheesy but other than that it's very pretty.
4.0,"Once keys are on, works great.  Unfortunately, getting the keys on the loops can be very difficult--I tore a fingernail in half...they are so tightly wound, so be careful."
4.0,"When if first got this silver toggle bracelet by Nugz Jewelry, I didn't quite understand what it was. I thought wow this is a weird little pendant that has on it with the &#34;Nugz&#34; label. However after I looked around on the post and really understand a hundred percent what it was,I thought it was super cool. Pretty much you can make it into any bracelet you want, for any ensemble you're wearing. They have a bunch of interchangeable snaps that you can buy to replace uneven glass flaps which I thought was pretty cool. I can't wait to order a couple more snaps. I like the fact that they even have snaps four different types of styles. The bracelet itself is pretty nice call Mo however I wish it was all staying silver. However, it is just silver plated. I looked on the description and couldn't figure out if it was silver-plated what comma however it would be cool if it was silver-plated stainless steel. There are three ropes that connect each band, and it is held together by a &#34;T&#34; piece and a loop that it connects to. There are multiple loops to adjust the bracelet to your size wrist. It's kind of hard to get it on at first, and I was worried that I might not be able to get it off single-handedly, however it's much easier to get off than it is to get on. It is a little heavy, and is not very dainty so definitely not for someone who doesn't mind having something larger around their wrists. It seems pretty heavy duty and hasn't turned my wrist green yet so I am happy with this purchase and can't wait to try out some different style. I receive this product at a discounted rate"
4.0,Bigger than what I expected. Great quality.
4.0,Cute but a little big
4.0,I love the cut & color of this top but it runs small.  I got a L & could barely get my arms in it.  Gave this one to my niece who loved it as well but will definately reorder in larger size.  May have to go to 1X for correct fit
4.0,"Bluetooth was super easy to connect.<br />Not the loudest, but that's not the point.<br />Either I have a big head, or the beanie is a little tight, but not uncomfortable."
4.0,"When I first opened the package and felt the material I was disappointed and thought I would hate the outfit. The material felt like cheap costume fabric. It was not scratchy or gross feeling. Just thin and cheap feeling but still soft and smooth. However, when I put it on the fit was very nearly exactly what I wanted and it looked really great on so I am inclined to forgive the cheap thin fabric. Though it is important to keep in mind that as thin as it is it may end up being see through in bright light so if you are concerned test that and plan to wear something under depending on what you are wearing it for.<br /><br />As for the fit follow the seller's size chart and look at their photos. It is true to what they list for the fit they show in their images (ie very fitted body con and really short). I don't prefer extreme fit body con or really short and cropped so I sized up by one based on what their chart said and it worked perfectly for me or almost perfectly. The skirt is just a bit above knee length and the top while still cropped is only mildly cropped and nearly reaches the top of the skirt. With a thin camisole underneath the top this should work out well.<br /><br />For reference I am 5 feet tall and 110 lbs. Chest 32DD and waist is 26 inches. I have a short torso even for my height and longer legs so keep in mind if you have a longer torso this top will be more cropped on you. I ordered the size Large and it was almost perfect. I would have liked between 1/3 - 3/4 inch longer on the top and the skirt I would have been happy with another 1/3 of an inch or so. Everything fit a little looser then in the photo since I sized up but not in a sloppy or oversized way. Just in a nice comfortable fit kind of way. I would try another size up to get that extra length I really want but I am concerned that it would then be too loose on. If you don't mind doing lots of returns and want extra length you could always try both one size up and two sizes up and find out which you prefer otherwise just do one size up unless you are much taller with a longer torso."
4.0,if used correctly benefits are great it is a bit annoying to where but it is a great product
4.0,"Large fit me kind of snug. An XL would have gave me more room. If you are a busty female, then I would recommend going a size up. Zipper pockets also get stuck easily. Overall good product"
4.0,"The dress is lightweight and lovely for hot weather. So comfortable, too. Washes very well. I wear a size 8, ordered a Medium and it fit well."
4.0,"Can't give 5 stars because they do seem to feel a tiny bit chinsy, but they still work good"
4.0,Love the glamour look
4.0,‚ù§ them very stylish but a bit small
4.0,i have bought 3 of these. they are well made. will buy more in the future. i collect watches so alway's needing bands. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. i would definitely recommend these bands.
4.0,The sleeves are a bit tight and the body is wider than what I expected. The fabric is thinner than I expected. I'll need to wear a thin cami underneath.
4.0,A little tight but its not bad. I would order a size up if you dont like form hugging shirts. Made out of the stretch swimsuit like material. The print is very well done
4.0,"I'm not a watch collector or anything, so I won't be able to give any kind of in-depth/comparison-based review of this watch.<br /><br />There are no individual minute/second markers between the hour numerals, so I wouldn't expect to use this for precise measuring of time.<br /><br />The spring, or reserve power, seems to last approximately 2 days fully wound.<br /><br />While there is a swivel for winding the watch from wrist movement; however, I'm not a terribly active individual, so I have to manually wind the watch using the crown, which is something I expected when looking for a mechanical watch and not a problem for me.<br /><br />The spring appears to be designed with a mechanism to prevent damaging the watch from over-winding, and the spring visibly spins in place if wound beyond its full capacity. (The spring is mostly visible just below the 12 and 1 hour numerals, allowing you to visually gauge how far along the spring is in unwinding)<br /><br />The watch otherwise seems to keep fairly accurate time, although the sparse instructions that came with the watch warns that it can gain/lose 30 seconds over the course of a day. If you're fine with having a step in your daily routine that involves winding your watch and synchronizing it with a reliable source, this shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />My only complaint lies in the watch's strap/bracelet. Link removal was simple enough (it was too large for my wrist out of the box), but the spring-loaded pin that connects one end of the strap to the latch mechanism seems to pop out every once in awhile. I believe this is probably a simple at-home fix at best or a replacement pin at worst.<br /><br />Aside from the pin complaint, the watch meets all the criteria I had while looking for a watch, so overall I'm satisfied with this one."
4.0,I love them. It's like having two earrings for the price of one.
4.0,"Good quality rubber, trims nicely, and is very comfortable. Latch seems cheap compared to the rest of the band, and is a bit loose."
4.0,This is very comfortable. Dressy and easy to put on.  It stays in place.
4.0,Great sports bra. Fits great but hard to clasp. Just do it ahead of time.
4.0,"I run about 3-4 times per week, and one problem I have is what to do with my phone (which I need to carry). I don't like arm-bands, and in most shorts pockets, the phone swings around too much. The pocket of the inner liner on these shorts works reasonably well; the phone still moves a bit but not enough to be annoying. Otherwise these are fairly typical, functional, comfortable running shorts (with a curiously long drawstring)."
4.0,"Gave it as a gift, and the recipient loves it. Leaves a bit of a green mark where it touches her neck, though. Fun buy for the price."
4.0,"These are fun glasses, they are cheaper so clearly not the best quality but the lense is a good shade and they fit fine.  One of the 12 had a loose screw so it fell out.  I was able to screw it back in and it works fine.  They are perfect for a party occasion."
4.0,"This is my 2nd watch from Wristology. It has a nice big face and simple, elegant look. These watches are made well and that is what I like the most."
4.0,Good quality. I would buy again. We are using for my kids Christmas program...they are perfect.  Other than not arriving when said...very good product.
4.0,Perfect gift for my husband
4.0,"The fit is on the larger size; however for comfort and breathability while sleeping I find that ideal. Also my toddler can grow into them.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the garment is. Unlike many printed articles of clothing, There is a lining inside, adding to the comfort. I don‚Äôt see the print cracking and fading over time due tot the quality."
4.0,"I have this in black and white. The material is not thick as their dresses are known for. I also expected it to have more stretch as the black and white one, but no such luck. On a positive note...the colour has not faded. I hope they go back to the thick material - that is why i loved purchasing from them, but wasn't so happy with this 1."
4.0,I love this item because most of my purses are big and wide open. It is a huge help for me. I arrived very fast.
4.0,spooky....
4.0,Arrived on time and was what it was supposed to be.
4.0,"They are bigger than expected, but i love them. Not too heavy, they are cute!"
4.0,"I bought 10 of these earings as party favors. They arrived nicely packed. Only problem, with few earings, the posts on the back side we're bend a little. I had to straighten them by hand very gently. I'm glad they did not brake."
4.0,Nice costume but arrived reeking of fish.
4.0,I like the many different colors and I LIKE the fact that the earpieces are NOT elastic!
4.0,He likes the fit and color so that's all that matters
4.0,Light light is very weak but good buy
4.0,"Great value for the price.  Needed to dress my daughter like Pete the Cat for school so I bought these figuring she could use a pair of funky high tops in her wardrobe anyway.  They're not the greatest quality, but she's 5 and will wreck them in no time anyway.  She loves that they're sparkly and shiny.  I replaced the red laces with white ones to make them pop more."
4.0,"I thought this skirt was really cute, but unfortunately it fit too big. I normally wear a size large in everything (I'm 5'8"" and 170lb) but the large was a little big on me. I will be reordering it in a size medium"
4.0,"the faux leather sticks to your skin more than regular leather, but over all looks really nice and no issues thus far. The pin lever is a very helpful assist."
4.0,My 15yr old grand daughter wears this a lot. Not really what I would call sweatshirt material though.
4.0,"Soft cotton material, cute pattern, but the zipper bumps up the fabric which is annoying."
4.0,"Very comfortable sports bra. I wear a DDD and have a hard time finding good sports bras. I will say though your boobs will still bounce in this bra it doesn't completely keep them restricted, but I still think these are comfortable. I bought the XXL."
4.0,"I love this band! It's a lot longer than I expected so it's plenty big and comfortable, so I already ordered more. The only thing, on one side, it started to peel after a few days of wear. Not sure if I hit it funny or if I got a faulty one. Right now it's not a big deal, hopefully it doesn't get worse."
4.0,These are not photochromatic. which sucks cause they are a lil dark at night
4.0,"I wear a size 30-31, and the medium fits almost perfectly (it might be a a tad bit loose, but a belt will definitely do the trick). Definitely dig the slim fit and the pockets and the stretch. Hopefully these bad boys impress me during my upcoming glacier hike in Iceland‚Äîwill update if they do."
4.0,"Somehow I completely missed the fact that this shirt had pockets. I have no idea how, cause the model photos in the listing show them.<br /><br />The pickets outside of the model photos are not even half as flattering though. They stick out very awkwardly, like there is way too much material there. They refuse to sit flat, which just makes your silhouette appear even WIDER.<br /><br />The shirt overall was incredibly soft and comfortable though. I wore mine all day at work in a cafe during summer and didn't feel too warm."
4.0,Very nice quality although clasp is a little stiff and difficult to open.  Otherwise a lovely piece.
4.0,I am short waisted and this top fit great. Not too long like most.
4.0,If anything they are on the small side but it fit pretty much as expected.
4.0,Nice glasses for a good price. The frames are flexible but can't really say much as my kids haven't used them yet.
4.0,"From the label: Made in China; 100% polyester; dry clean only<br /><br />It‚Äôs 35‚Äù long and 3-3/4‚Äù wide<br />Mine arrived in a zip bag printed: ‚Äúsoft and cool modal/cotton underwear‚Äù. Mmkay.<br /><br />I wasn't formerly a 'scarf person' but have a condition that‚Äôs left bad scarring on my neck; sometimes I‚Äôm self-conscious now that I have a super short hair cut. So I like to keep a few fun scarves around. But I find it difficult to locate a good skinny scarf as most offerings are way too dressy, heavy, or, most problematic due to my personal taste and edgier wardrobe: far too preppy. I‚Äôm not off to Newport, I‚Äôm a boots and tees kind of girl.  So I chose the skulls version. The skulls aren‚Äôt too grim, they‚Äôre mostly smiling (so I don‚Äôt feel too Halloween-y wearing it). The addition of the word ‚Äúfashion‚Äù that‚Äôs printed along the bottom of both scarves is a little LOL to me; feels a bit like printing the word ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù on your mittens or something. Anyhoo, I like how lightweight this is and the fact it didn‚Äôt arrive a wrinkled mess. I also appreciate that the white one is truly a bright white and not dingy looking. It would be nice, as the scarf is a bit shiny, as poly tends to be, if this was available in a washing machine-friendly cotton (like the wonky packaging claims it is).  At this price point I‚Äôm not too worried about it.  Quality is decent, no weird chemical odors that plague this ilk of textile, and most of the seams are straight. Not sure if I‚Äôm at the height of ‚Äòfashion‚Äô when sporting this, but, for my purposes, it‚Äôll do just fine. Cannot vouch for how well it works on a handbag, but I can‚Äôt see any reason why it wouldn‚Äôt. One star deducted for the location of the laundry tag‚Äîit‚Äôs scratchy, stiff/won‚Äôt relax, and is very hard to remove without damaging the fabric."
4.0,Ordered my usual size and it fits. I could have also gone up a size and it probably fit too. Cute simple suit.
4.0,"I loved this tank, the only issue is that it definitely runs too small. I'm 5'1&#34; and weigh 108 and I'm always small or xs and I ordered the medium and it fits but not like I would want it to so I would definitely recommend ordering 2 sizes bigger. It's a cool tank top. For the future I'll be ordering size large."
4.0,"I am actually exchanging this dress for a smaller size. I am 5'4&#34; 160lbs and I ordered a medium. It fit, but not like I would like it to so I returned it and ordered a small. The material is nice and the dress appears the same in person as it does online."
4.0,Most panties too small - these are actually a lil too wide in the legs.  But I like them!
4.0,"This would have been everything I wanted.  I could not believe how thick the material was.  It really has some weight to it and would more than likely keep you nice and cozy.  It appears to be a very high quality outfit, but it was just too big.  I wish I could have gotten it in my size.  If you can get your size it would be well worth the purchase."
4.0,"First of all, these arrived pretty intensely scratched, a series of scratches across the bottom of mainly the left lens but also a little on the right lens.  I tried to take a photo.  It's distracting when wearing them because the scratches cut right across my field of vision.  So I probably will never wear these.  That's really disappointing because I kind of liked these.<br /><br />If I had seen these in a store, I would never have purchased these. I guess this is where buying blindly online can come in handy. I like these crazy glasses! They're huge and not at all my style, but I really think they're the kind of glasses that will look cute on anyone. They turn everything yellow rather than really shade from the sun.  (I got the pink and gold). But since I can't wear them, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Edit: Updating my review. The vendor reached out to me right away and gave me credit to purchase a new pair. Unfortunately, the new pair that arrived was not the pair that I ordered. That was apparently the fault of Amazon, who fulfilled the second order for SojoS. So props to SojoS for their customer service for trying to make it right. It's not really their fault that Amazon then screwed it up."
4.0,Good buy! Item was breathable and comfortable and if you use it to workout it dries really fast. My only con is that I don't think it would fit a 50&#34; waist as advertised. I have about a 44&#34; waist right now and belt barely closes. The velcro kinda pokes me in the stomach right now but since I plan to loose weight I hope it won't irritate me for long.
4.0,"I bought this for a specific purpose, I wanted it to look like an Apple watch, without the $400 payment. It does that just fine.  I was also looking for old style LED watch numbers, with a new style watch body and strap. This checks those 2 boxes also. It is a $10 or less watch, so I don't expect much from it. Its an all plastic watch body and bezel, so it is babied as to not get a scratch. I NEVER set it face down. And always store it in a soft pouch or on a soft surface. It has a cheap rubber/plastic-type band with a plastic post to latch it, which I am sure will break off probably within a year. But at the low cost of $10 I can buy another one no problem. It does absolutely nothing but tell time, exactly what I needed. It does not come with english instructions (chinese only) so setting it takes a couple of tries at pushing and holding various buttons. It takes about 2 weeks to get it from China, it does not ship from the USA. Again, no surprise here as it is the second cheap watch I ordered from China. Order it way in advance if it is a gift. As long as you know up front that it is cheap, and still looks ok, you will not be disappointed for the price.<br /> It has an added bonus of large, bright digital numbers, so it is easy to read the time without my glasses. When this breaks I will just buy another."
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; at 155 lbs. The material is slightly thinner than their cotton version. I am happy with my purchase. Based on the reviews, I ordered a large. Anyone larger or heavier than me will be a walking sausage. I wish they have the shoulder area wider because back when I was 55 lbs lighter, my shoulder was always wide at about 17 inches and not the standard 14 inches. I always feld like my sleeves began by my shoulder blades."
4.0,The fit is tighter than previous pairs of this brand of glove have been so I'm VERY glad I ordered a size bigger than what I used to own.
4.0,Excellent dress for Work
4.0,a bit smaller than expected but ok
4.0,"A little big (long) for my ears, but very cute! The clasp does hurt when you have it on for extended periods of time."
4.0,Pretty good for a basic time and date watch. Pretty accurate. Like the look. Too bad the chronograph features dont work...but I knew that when I bought it
4.0,"My girlfriend loves it, It fits her pretty well, the only problem is the neck hole is really small. Overall, it's pretty comfy, and is definitely worth the price"
4.0,Thought the sleeves would be much longer but they almost end at shoulder. I do have large shoulders maybe that‚Äôs why. I like it though
4.0,"I just got this and tried it on, deciding to keep it so I cut off the tag and threw away the packaging material . The first time I decided to wear it, I noticed the shoulders are quite loose even though the rest of the shirt is very snug. I am 34 in the bust and normally wear a size 6, so according to the size chart I need a M or L. I bought the M but definitely should have gone with a Small. I am afraid the most important part of the shirt -- the shoulders -- will not be tight enough to pull my posture straight. I would say do not size up as the Size Chart indicates. I hope I didn't just waste $120 because now I cannot return it for a Small."
4.0,üòäüòçüòçüòç
4.0,Looks great. Very thick and heavy. This is for winter use.
4.0,-Great fit<br />-Very comfortable<br />-Not very slip resistant
4.0,Kind of wide but that's not an option for fit. Super cute though!
4.0,The material is super soft and feels great against the skin. It fits perfectly and is great for fall weather.
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my son's wedding. It's the right color, fit and material. I like that it is comfortable, can accessorize with pretty much anything and will be easy to dance across the floor in."
4.0,It's cute and the material is flattering if you've got the muscles to show.
4.0,Now if I could just remember to wear them they might even help
4.0,It isn't a high quality shirt but my grandson loves it because of the logo so it was a big hit.
4.0,Nice product. Good quality.  Not as thick as I‚Äôd have expected but good.
4.0,"Looks a lot like Miu Miu glasses. However, after dropping it several times, the little screws in the middle fell off so I always have to adjust it everytime I wear it. Overall, highly recommend"
4.0,"Great suit has support for the girls, lower half covers all areas that need to be covered. Sorry about flash in mirror."
4.0,These silicone rings are great for people who are active or have hands-on jobs that metal rings could interfere with. This Harry Potter one has the Deathly Hallows symbols on it which actually you have to be up-close to tell what it is but that doesn't detract at all. I like that they're flexible and breathable. I don't like that they print the WB trademark on it so there's a break in the design that I sometimes have to turn the ring so it's not visible. Wish they'd have printed that on the inside.
4.0,The clothes were just fit for me like them .
4.0,Bag was right size that I needed for travel. The strap could be longer and adjustable.
4.0,"The frames are matte finish. The lens are clean and scratch free. The build is just okay. The hinges aren't as durable as other glasses. Though, for nine dollars, I can't really complain."
4.0,Good for Halloween
4.0,"It's a hat, it is comfortable and it fits as expected. There is nothing else to say about a hat is there?"
4.0,Sleeves awkward but overall a sexy fit
4.0,"This is a very light weight dress, perfect for a summer evening event. I think that it looks really pretty on, but the length was several inches short of floor length. Perhaps it should be called tea length."
4.0,The bottom band rolls a bit but it's a comfortable bra.
4.0,It‚Äôs a great jacket I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments but if u want that tight fit then get ur normal size but if you want it a little loser than size up one. I got a size six but it‚Äôs kinda tight but h wear it all the time and the it doesn‚Äôt stretch out to where it‚Äôs not a slim for anywhere so that‚Äôs great!! Any ways I love tu is jacket so I recommend also everyone has said it looks so much like the lulu one so but it!!
4.0,I liked the idea of it but it was a bit small. Had to squeeze the girls name on it. Otherwise it was great
4.0,Pretty earrings for a reasonable price!
4.0,Love the necklace but it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Pay specially attention to the size listed (I clearly did not)
4.0,"These socks are good quality and love the colors, but these socks keep twisting on my feet after wearing them a few hours."
4.0,"The design and quality is very nice, but it's pockets are small and tight fitting. Even after a month of usage."
4.0,I was having issues with my glasses fogging up from wearing a mask in the colder weather and this helped a bunch with that! The anti-fog effect lasted about a week before I had to respray. I highly recommend for keeping that annoying fog at bay!
4.0,Smaller altered
4.0,Great purchase but had to return.  Way too big for my petite frame.
4.0,Very comfortable. The leg covering (boots) slide down at the knee.
4.0,"The product fit is huge, However, neck will not allow a smaller fit.  The dress is advertised as a large fitting dress."
4.0,"Very gold and I loved it, but the material is hot and do not breath"
4.0,"It was stiff and the zippers were hard to operate in the beginning.  Once it heats to your body temp, it gets more supple."
4.0,"Love this purse! I've gotten so many compliments on it already. The quality is actually really good for the price and it has that rich real leather smell. Only thing is that the clip on the hoop is more silver than gold like the rest of the metal.<br /><br />Update: ring fell off multiple times. If you get this, be sure to glue the screw holding the ring together as soon as you get it. Use thread lock or something"
4.0,These were just what I wanted for my granddaughter.  It‚Äôs so hard to find undershirts for little girls.
4.0,Fitment is great but the material is a lot‚Äã weaker than the original watch band.
4.0,"2nd edit: the second pair seem better than the first. No breaks or sunscreen issues so far. I appreciate the seller reaching out and sending a replacement pair.<br /><br />Edit: the seller contacted me and replaced the broken sunglasses with a free new pair. They look nice but not sure if I'll have more problems as I'm using another replacement pair.<br /><br />These sunglasses broke in two places within a month, and experienced weird discoloration where the plastic touched sunscreen. When the first break happened, I repaired it with super glue. Literally the next day, a second break occurred on the top of other side of the frame."
4.0,This dress fit great and was very comfortable
4.0,"Love this dress for the cost. I'm 5'8 and 150 and the medium fit pretty well. Slightly tight feeling in bust though and I'm only a c cup. Also slightly short. But overall for trend and value, I'll wear it again"
4.0,"Material is very smooth, not like regular polyester, a bit see-thru so wear a light colored bra or a tank under and the bottom is too tight for my hips, but wearable if you tuck the extra length under.  My favorite part is the sleeves, the way it &#34;puffs&#34; on the shoulder is very feminine.  I am normally size L-XL, ordered &#34;size 14&#34; but the label says, &#34;size XXXL&#34; - I did not feel like I would split the seams putting this shirt on.  Overall, it's a decent shirt for the price, the free necklace is a nice touch, although I probably won't wear it as silver plated metals give me a rash."
4.0,"I bought these for my bridesmaids and am taking them to be embroidered. They are perfect for weddings,poolside wraps and around the house lounging. The material is somewhat rough and thin but after washing them with some fabric softener I'm sure they'll come out softer. As far as being thin, it's probably a good thing, you can stay cool but be covered up."
4.0,"So now I know not to get size 14 if your a guy, get a size 12. The XXL fits good and feels like a men's large but I don't like it being I'm skinny and like some what coats like this tight fighting, that's why I wanted a large it's a men's medium."
4.0,Son muy frescas de excelente calidad las recomiendo las uso para mi compa√±√≠a de construcci√≥n.las recomiendo .
4.0,Muy bonita igualita ala de la foto me encanto
4.0,It fit as expected but it was a little poor in quality.
4.0,"Super cute, a little pricy and a little small. For the price, my daughter outgrew them way too fast. Buy a size bigger!"
4.0,I very much like the watch. The silicone strap though leaves much to be desired. It is way to rubbery and the strap retaining holders(when watch is fastened) do not stay in place. They are much too loose. I fastened a high quality ISOFRANE rubber strap from one of my other watches to this watch and all is good. Other than that quality seems quite good for the price point.
4.0,"These run a bit large and they stretched out too. If you‚Äôre in between size, go with the smaller size."
4.0,A little smaller then expected but they still fit
4.0,"As like as expected, very nice dress and giod quality"
4.0,I wear this every day that it is clean!  I love the colors and pockets. It is a good cool choice for the current hot summer.
4.0,Great design except the 4.5mm grove for the watch bracelet was not wide enough for my invicta sub aqua noma III 5.5mm link thickness.
4.0,"Decent pants for the money, like the pockets."
4.0,"Great compression option for the price, not as lightweight as I'd hoped but also not too heavy, you will have to pay a premium for ultralight options for similar style compression organizing cubes. Considering the price difference these are fantastic"
4.0,"Update: I ended up wearing the first one I ever put in for 24 hours, overnight and while eating chips and pizza. It got uncomfortable and a little irritated underneath my tongue. I was relieved to switch back to my long barbell. It did not break. I tried another one today at work and there was no discomfort and it did not break- I wore it for 6.5hours. I don't know if my tongue was less sensitive to the edges or if the one I put in today was less scratchy on the sensitive under-tongue. Other than paying shipping on all 3 packs I ordered, I am really impressed SO FAR. No one has noticed I'm wearing it, but I'm short and I don't advertise my piercing at work.<br /><br />I read the reviews (breaking and sharp complaints) and ordered 3 packages just in case. I had to pay shipping separately for each one, which means it was $10 for the items and $10 for the shipping. A little stupid, as it did not cost $10 to ship all of these in one small package. One star off for that.<br />The first one I put in has not broken or some out yet and it's only been 30m.<br /><br />I will do a large test today and a work day test tomorrow. I don't want to have to leave my tongue un-pierced, as it heals quickly.<br />I have a long barbell usually, so this snug fit makes me a little nervous.<br />Both sides unscrew, which means it's double flimsy.<br />It's not as stealthy as I had hoped. I will still need to not stick out my tongue or advertise that I have it or they will probably tell me to take it out.<br /><br />For now, the first one I put in hasn't broken and although it is *slightly* uncomfortable on the bottom of my tongue, it's entirely bearable.<br />I will update this if things go badly.<br />Check the photo for how it looks."
4.0,Kind of small when putting on a wide size 11 it looked kind of funny<br />Also the skin tone was off but it was a great gag gift for the men in my family
4.0,Sturdy and last a whole lot longer than the cheap ones at walmart.
4.0,My toddler got a lot of use out of these and they are really cute. The Velcro began to rip off over time but luckily she had grown into the next shoe size up by the time we needed a replacement.
4.0,"As I believe other reviewers have mentioned, the women's sizes are off by a whole number.  Otherwise, this works great.  I bought two for a project I run in Guatemala after some reviewers said that they are flimsy and break easily.  I've measured at least 50 feet with the device, sometimes screaming and kicking children, and it hasn't broken at all.  (I even accidentally launched it across the room the other day where it smacked my cement wall and then landed on my cement floor...oops.  Hasn't broken yet.)"
4.0,"This scarf is beautiful and it goes with many items in my closet. I was surprised when it came because it wasn't a continuous loop even though the product name says it's an infinity scarf. Personally, I prefer large rectangle scarves more than infinity scarfs, so I'm happy with it."
4.0,Hangs beautifully. Very comfortable. Looks really nice.
4.0,"Picture is better than the actual necklace.  However, it is still very nice."
4.0,"I'm 5'5 120 pounds, bought a small. It's fairly short, but still very cute."
4.0,"I like it, but it is a little smaller than it looks in the picture. It fits nicely, but there are a couple of markings on the back that I do not like."
4.0,Super comfy but just a tad large
4.0,Its cute but too thing
4.0,"Bought Med & Lrg in ciel blue & teal green.  Love the colors and fit is pretty good they actually fit me better than the Dickes in same style.  I gave a set to my sister in law who also loves them.  We have very different body shapes but they fit & flatter bother of our figures nicely.  Would really give 5 stars, but wish they had more colors in stock for the size I need (navy specifically).<br />Material is good quality & they wash well.  Would buy again!"
4.0,Just what I expected after reading all the other reviews. Really like it.
4.0,My son was so excited with the hat.  Nice purchase.
4.0,"Item seems a nice quality for the price. The hat is a bit smaller than anticipated. It will fit an average adult head, but with a bit of a tight fit. The material is a tad thin, but peak of the hat stood well, with formed brim. Perfect for decor or party supply. Purchased for an event, so I hope to update with picture afterward."
4.0,It's a cute little pin.  Wish it was a bit bigger; but very nice nonetheless.
4.0,"I was confused when I received it because it felt like silk.  The tag says 100% rayon.  I didn't notice this until after I machine washed it (on delicate cycle, cold water, with Woolite).  It came out perfectly fine--even softer.  Medium fits 6'0"", 205 (mostly muscle) perfect!  Beautiful shirt!  Just isn't linen, which may be better because it won't wrinkle as much?"
4.0,Very small charm.  The jewel is barely visible.
4.0,"I purchased this scarf in peach and it is definitely more peach than the picture shows.  The picture looks more of a yellow gold to me.  Anyway, the scarf is very lightweight and when I first removed it from the package, I put a small hole in it simply by pulling it open, the fabric is so delicate.  However, I really like that it's thin.  I can wear it during warm days without a problem.  The drawback is that it tends to billow out and not stay close to my body.  I can get around this a bit by twisting it, but I always feel like it's a little bigger than I'd like.  I'll try folding it next.  Basically, it's not my favorite scarf but a nice lightweight affordable accessory I'm happy to add to my closet."
4.0,Love them !!! The are kinda wide and short so I‚Äôd order a size up but very adorable.
4.0,super cute and they fit my 4 month old great
4.0,Very happy with this purchase.  Looks great and price was right on.  Fast shipping.  Ran a tad bit big but not too much still fits the size. Plus I think it best it did not dig into my curves and covered by large size breast.  Many compliments
4.0,"Overall sock size is fine. Toes are tight, and take a bit of finesse to put on. Will order a size up next time"
4.0,"Very warm, somewhat uncomfortable after LONG periods of use, but not restrictive. Good product!"
4.0,Looks cute but way to thin no option to use filters which would thicken product and fit better
4.0,"Provides good arch support for medium to high arches. The rubber made my toes a little sore from walking around, but other than that, these are nice."
4.0,"Nice, but, easy to LOSE. Backs not secure."
4.0,"Frame came off a few times but after a few times fixing it, it stay on. They fog but I was expecting that. For the price I think they are pretty decent."
4.0,"I purchased this Scarf to wear to the newly released My Little Pony movie with a friend and her little girl. It was perfect for the event but is VERY full. I had to work to keep all that fabric from enveloping my neck. I love an infinity scarf, but this one is a little too much."
4.0,"Nice to wear, looks cool, but leaves a really really strong smell."
4.0,"I like the item, the reason that I gave 4 stars is because the color is lighter than the picture."
4.0,This was a gift. The packaging looked pretty & sparkling...
4.0,"The Gi is great quality, fabric is strong but not too heavy and i loveeee that it doesnt have any logos. The only bad part is that the top fit perfectly but the pants were just a tad short. And i havent even washed it, so im a little scared. Im a very small girl, but have long legs so wish there was an in betweeen size."
4.0,Love the material and the color thanks
4.0,"Cool collectors item, the display box they come in is only cardboard though."
4.0,"I ordered a 3x which is what I generally wear with most brands. I wear 44H bra so I am top heavy. The material is a nice quality and not too thick, the dress could definitely be worn in the summer, or in the fall paired with a pair of tights and boots. Im tall so the dress falls just above my knees. This  picture I added is trying it on right out of the package. I couldn‚Äôt get the top buttoned, but I did not have on a bra. With a bra on it still would not button completely so if you are top heavy I definitely recommend a cami or bralette to prevent too much spillage."
4.0,"I love Esteez clothing. I bought the black but wanted another color as well so I ordered Magenta. Choice was limited. When it arrived I knew I made a mistake. Too bright. I returned it. Please offer a broader color range, not so bright."
4.0,"Comfy,  stretchy... Not cool but pretty thin material. I work fast pace retail,  I currently have to wear a mask all day.  This is my new favorite but I still get sweaty sometimes."
4.0,"Comfortable Good Quality, Yet a slight slip factor when wet especially if used for Sauna/ Steam-room and Gym Shower."
4.0,The dress is really pretty. It had a bad smell when first opened it but I let it air out and seems fine now. My daughter loved it. It was a 5th birthday gift. She really feels like a princess in it.
4.0,"This is a very pretty design, very delicate. It is shorter than I expected it to be, but I'm going to put an extender on it so it can be a better length. I know that it does come in different metals, but the sterling silver is my favorite. I did receive this at a discount."
4.0,"The skirt is beautiful. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too small. I ordered a medium which is usually what I wear, but it just did not work. The skirt's material was thin, but I think it would be a perfect skirt for the summer time."
4.0,"very pretty blouse.  I bought a size XL and could have worn the L.  I have no regrets.  The fabric is stretchy so in my opinion, buy the size you normally would."
4.0,It does the job! lol
4.0,"Perfect, trying to find someone to put the band on"
4.0,"Love this bag! Classy looking sports bag, only wish it was a little bit smaller. Also the zippers need a little zipper wax to work more smoothly.<br /><br />I was looking for a duffle bag I could take to work that didn't look ugly. This one is nice because it has a structured bottom so it maintains its shape even with heavy shoes inside. Exactly what I was looking for!"
4.0,We used this for my girls princess poppy Halloween costume and it was perfect. The skirt stayed poofy and not flat. It was well made. We purchased two of them in two different sizes and they both ran small. Size up!
4.0,I like the material for the hat it doesn't make you sweat but it keeps your head warm and the fact that there are two in this order.
4.0,"These are a great alternative to brand name compression socks that run into the $15 range for just one pair.  These are unbranded, Chinese, with decent quality.  They fit as expected.<br />Have only used them once, so I will revisit review after a few more visits to the gym."
4.0,Fits great and I love the design. It does come a little large so I did have to adjust it. The tool for the wrist adjustment is included but it was a bit tricky to get the adjustment completed. Would recommend and also very stylish.
4.0,very good. Not 5 because i would like heavier material
4.0,"It is a good product for the price, it will be perfect if the quality of silver stud be improved."
4.0,"They look great, but glass feels like prescription glasses. Hurting my eyes...."
4.0,Fit good I cant tell how good they are yet I treated them now to see how long they last. I will update my review in about 6 months after I put them to the test but they seem to be a well built boot from first look.
4.0,I like the product but the rose gold doesn‚Äôt match my rose gold watch.
4.0,I loved the color. So rich and vibrant.
4.0,"It's cute, but the fabric is really stiff & the belt loops are in an awkward place for my body shape."
4.0,"Great with black pants, doesn't wrinkle, and easy to toss on."
4.0,What a gorgeous blouse! Looks amazing and quality is great. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars it's because it runs somewhat large and it fits a litlle loose.
4.0,"Clasp is difficult to operate, but the watch is cute and keep time as expected. Item looks just as pictured."
4.0,I really like the look of these and they are stretchy but I have curvy hips and they definitely go up to the waist and have a zipper and because I just don't like that style I sent them back. They were really cute but I just don't like the way highways to things fit on me and I didn't realize they had a zipper.
4.0,Fit right in my shoe. No trimming necessary. very comfortable.
4.0,"The synthetic opals in these are beautiful and haven't faded or dulled at all after a couple of months. All of the stones are still in place and haven't fallen out. The metal hasn't irritated my ears at all and I'm pretty sensitive to most metals. Lost a star because the post was a bit too long for my cartilage in my ear, and it'll flip upside down or sideways or doesn't stay in line with my ear. Overall good for the price."
4.0,"The neck is a bit big so the dress tends to hang off my shoulder. I wore a layer under it to solve that issue. Other than that, it is exactly what I wanted and a great value for a fun casual Christmas dress."
4.0,Loved this boot but I have fat ankles and was too tight there.
4.0,"The watch band removal tool was smaller than I expected , but certainly adequate for the task. The rubber bands are what I expected and should do the job very well. Great Price!"
4.0,Great quality but they run small. So if you were a large be safe an go with an extra large.
4.0,A little small for my big head but not so much that I can wear it.
4.0,It‚Äôs not that stretchy but it‚Äôs good enough to move in!
4.0,"My granddaughter still loves this, though she had to unsnap the bottom so she would be more comfortable. May this is her grandma's fault and not that of the piece of clothing."
4.0,My only issue with the bag is that the straps are sewn In a way that does now allow you to open the bag very wide.
4.0,Es muy c√≥modo lo √∫nico malo es que al hablar se descubre la nariz
4.0,"Great watch for the price. Although it does not state how water resistant it is, I've worn it while washing dishes and showering without any issues. Only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is for the dim night light, but time is still visible."
4.0,"While I don't use cash as much as I used to, I still want a wallet that can accommodate bills and a few coins as well as credit and membership cards. This one works for me. It has a driver's license slot with a clear front, and 16 slots for credit and membership cards. Bills fit into the two pockets beneath the card slots, and a small coin purse with a snap closure completes the wallet. There are only two things I'm not crazy about. This is a slim wallet, so it's longer -- 8 inches long, so it won't fit in very small purses and will stick out of shirt or coat pockets. And it doesn't have a snap closure, so the wallet can fall open. The card slots are pretty tight, though, so you shouldn't lose any cards if that happens. All in all, I like this wallet."
4.0,It's a little thinner material than I'd hoped for but my step son was pleased with it. I bought it for him to wear on game days at his place of employment.
4.0,Very nice for the price. I ordered the sterling silver and they fit the dime nicely and were easy to mount . They could be a tiny bit wider IMO but nice for the coin trim.
4.0,"Nice quality, but the braid does not fly as high as the picture."
4.0,Compares to Amelia James & LulaRoe for so much less! I bought in all colors!
4.0,I love these gowns. They're so comfortable and soft.  They're the only gowns that I like for winter.
4.0,"The sweater is well made and great quality. I wear a small, I find the sweater more of a medium"
4.0,Order AT LEAST 2 sizes larger.  But product is very cool.
4.0,I  wish the key rings were a little more heavy duty.<br /><br />But a good value for the price.
4.0,Love this suit. The only problem is the breast pads seem to shift around as others have mentioned. I'm afraid to take them out as the material is too thin for THAT! The fit is comfortable and slimming.
4.0,"cool shorts.  Heavy material.  zipper pockets, and fits me perfect because I have skinny legs.  Makes my butt look better.  I am a 34 waste but if you have any<br />issues with large legs or this this will be too tight.  Definitely  order a size bigger than what you would normally wear."
4.0,It was good quality and it almost fit me; it was a bit too big.
4.0,Have not really had a chance to wear them yet. But looks like quality material.
4.0,Really cute socks but ran HUGE like everyone else said. I purchased the smallest size available and they perfectly fit my 3 yr old. The yellow color is more of a soft gold not mustard. Overall really cute for the price
4.0,Super cute. Top was big.. I got a medium. I have a large bottom small on the top. 34B 130 lbs and 5&#34;4
4.0,"good material, so softer"
4.0,My friends daughter was very happy when she saw picture and happier now that finally got there- took a long time
4.0,"This chevron necklace is a dainty and pretty. The colors blend well together and the chain attachment on each side accentuates the shape. This necklace comes in a pretty light blue gift box with a cloth pouch inside which makes it great for gift giving.<br /><br />I like that it is adjustable from 16 to 18"" as I like mine closer to the 18"" length.<br /><br />As far as quality, this is fair to good. It's costume jewelry and an affordable price but I don't expect it to last long or stay looking nice for a lot of years like higher quality pieces. However, it's great for those who like stylish jewelry at an affordable price."
4.0,feels good on the feet.
4.0,"Bought these for my granddaughter her second pair of boots, she loves them, hard to get them off her"
4.0,"Super cute! Petite in size, which is what I was expecting/looking for. Would definitely recommend this"
4.0,They were a little tight at the thigh but after a wash they fit amazing. Would recommend for any guy.
4.0,nice this fabric.  Just a little more snug then I like.
4.0,"These are really adorable and appear to be well-made in person. They fit about a half size small (I usually wear a 7 or 7.5, and the 7 fit very snugly and I couldn't get the zipper up). Bummer, otherwise great deal!"
4.0,Was a little stiff not very soft wired for the 2 hours we needed it for.
4.0,I think I would've preferred a cap that fits over my nose. But I can't complain about what this is
4.0,I love this item! Very nice! Cheap!
4.0,Beautiful!! Bright and sparkly not to big.
4.0,"Really sharp looking watch! The band is comfortable IMO, even if it's a little tough at first. It is NOT white by any means, I don't understand why it's advertised like that. It is silver-faced. Also, the rotation makes a lot of noise. That said, it's a smooth movement. The blue hands and numbers pop out well."
4.0,"Pretty nice, wife loves them. They could be cheaper."
4.0,"It's a great product, I only wish it had more pen holders, it has plenty of storage holders by the way!"
4.0,Well made. Very comfortable. Great value
4.0,"Some days I could use a little more padding, but otherwise they are excellent.  I greatly appreciate the look and feel."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this dress fit.  I would buy it again in other colors/patterns.  It did come separate from the cinching string on the back and it was awful trying to get it through the loops, but once I got it, it was great."
4.0,"Okay, these things have no practical purpose whatsoever, and they're disposable...so what? They're fun! These ""glasses"" are pretty cool and can be worn by tweens, teens and adults.<br /><br />I have a small head (hat size 6 5/8) and they fit me fine so women, teens and tweens as well as adult men should be able to wear these. There's a button on the right temple. Press this once to turn on, press again and again to cycle through colors and hold down to turn off. Press the button on the left temple to turn on effects and mix colors.<br /><br />These would be fun for clubbing, parties, walking around town in well lit areas. DO NOT wear these when driving at night or in darkness as they will blind YOU and you will not be able to see! Semi-dark clubs or well lit city streets at night should be fine but you need to experiment safely to see when and under what conditions you can safely wear these. Yes, the effect is greatest in darkness but it WILL INTERFERE with your vision.<br /><br />I can see these are props for theatrical performances, wearing to Comic Con or just general fun. But, use these SAFELY! The other thing is that the controls and batteries are behind riveted panels so you can't change dead batteries on this. So, sadly, they are disposable. Still, a lot of fun for a small investment!"
4.0,"It took a very long time to receive this order, but it was well worth waiting for."
4.0,This is truly a statement piece.
4.0,Nice wallet with solid construction
4.0,"Lightweight,  breathable not bad for the price"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very pretty pendant. It was larger than expected. A bit large in size for a child, better suited for an adult."
4.0,High quality but size is way small. Gave them to my stepdad. I have a size 12 foot. He has a 10. Ordered a12.5 and they fit him perfectly
4.0,Very cute suit. Decent quality for price.  Order one size up. I'm a medium normally and needed a large for the top.  Bottoms seemed more true to size.
4.0,Very cute and good quality but runs a bit big.
4.0,"This dress is just as pictured, a bit sheer but nothing inappropriate for the beach or hot summer day. The only issue is the waist has zero stretch and was way too tight. I'm usually a small, ordered a medium, and it was still too tight by about an inch. Would have been good with a large."
4.0,Tells time and date and fits my wrist
4.0,"I bought this bag in eggshell blue from Macy's a few years ago. It's small, but cute and also wide enough to shove a bunch of junk inside. There's two zippered pockets.<br /><br />One has an interior flap pocket that runs the width of the bag. I use it for gum & a small comb. The other side's ""pocket"" is way too small - it's about the size of a credit card - to be useful.<br /><br />Now you might be thinking, ""maybe I want to keep my credit card in that pocket."" I say ""no you don't."" Unless you zip the bag all the way every time, your stuff will fall out quite often because the purse won't stay upright.  That's why it loses a star.<br /><br />This bag flips upside down because its straps are attached in the wrong spot. Most straps are located closer to the top of a bag so gravity weighs it down, keeping the opening facing up.<br /><br />But these straps are attached in the middle so there's no natural way for the bag to hang. Whenever you bend over or move a lot the bag flips upside down. Zip it up!!!"
4.0,It's pointy in the front corners of it which I wasn't expecting. 2 pics are of the hat on my head. Looks kinda funny but will not keep me from wearing it
4.0,She likes her collar.
4.0,Heats up as stated. Will use next week
4.0,Really nice and at a great price.
4.0,"Super cute, even though it runs a little small and material is kind of thin."
4.0,Had a weird smell. Other than that we love the coat!
4.0,"This dress is light and airy. It's perfect for warmer weather. The fabric is thin and has no stretch. There's a tie at the neckline and an elasticized waistband. The dress is fully lined for opacity. I found the fit to run slightly small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The large would have been ideal for me.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"I liked the style, just wish the size went beyond xl. But still very nice"
4.0,I did not see these in real time. My friend likes them.
4.0,It's cute for the price. Nothing extra special. Will make a nice swim cover-up for my daughter.
4.0,"Luv my GIEADUN's, fit great, looks awesome, & tons of compliments...<br />I have several pairs, all different colors.<br />My reasons for choosing this particular brand. They look absolutely kool for my tastes, & most importantly not even a fraction of the cost of some of the other major big boys..<br />I mean you can afford to lose a pair or two, and not completely go insane.<br />Trust when I tell you, $290.00 Oakleys lost, I wanted to shoot myself üòúü§™üòùüòâü§ó"
4.0,a bit on the thin side but it is true to color. It's a bit on the small side with a bit of stretch.
4.0,I'm 6' 6&#34; and this robe fits good.
4.0,"This robe is true to size, and I love the full sleeves since I have large upper arms. It is very comfortable and cool in our hot weather. I like the length which is just below the knee, and the snaps hold tightly. However, it does wrinkle quite a bit after washing, and there is already a hole in the fabric. Even so, I bought two more."
4.0,"When it worked, it was comfortable and perfectly sized. Used it on a trip to South Africa for a Safari with a 200-500mm zoom lens. That may have been too heavy, because the ""metal"" part (not sure if it really is) broke off, leaving the threaded part in the camera. The camera dropped a couple of feet and luckily my UV filter took the brunt of it (broke).<br /><br />Edited: I got a replacement from the seller promptly. Havent been on safari again, but thats good customer service."
4.0,Fits very well. I was completely satisfied.
4.0,They are a little bit to long.
4.0,Great shoes!  They are a little heavy but my grandson wears them everyday. The lights make them even more special.
4.0,"I really love the style, and am going to buy it in a least one other color. That said - the pockets are small; my iPhone 7 kept falling out. I wish it had deeper pockets, but if you're crafty enough (which I am) enlarging them isn't too hard. I wish I didn't have to, but it is what it is. Overall, I think it's a great dress - fashionable, well-constructed, and comfortable. I got plenty of compliments on it, and the sleeves were long enough that I didn't need to put anything over it to wear it to work."
4.0,"Larger than I thought but mine is amazing, I want to order another but the product seems to be inconsistent so I'm a little hesitant but like I said mine is great quality."
4.0,"Good quality belt that stretches a lot. In fact, so much so that I recommend buying the next size smaller than recommended for your waist measurement. If you like braided belts, you'll love these."
4.0,"Well, these boots fit nicely and water simply rolls over the suede when it is raining. I accidently actually spilled water on one of them and water simply rolled over without wetting the suede. With all that said, try not to walk too long in the rain because your socks will eventually start to feel wet, especially if you keep stepping on puddles of water. In brief, they are almost perfect."
4.0,The bottoms did not cover as much as I expected but overall great quality
4.0,My granddaughter loves this. It runs big around and short.
4.0,I was skeptical to purchase this one piece because there were different swim suits listed that were completely different. I did not want the suit with the skinny straps. The size chart is true to size. The colors are bright and the suit is comfortable.<br /><br />I had to update this review.. I washed it on delicate once and one of the seams began to come apart. Sad!
4.0,"Its really beautiful, I thought it was wider, though, like 2&#34; and it's actually about 1&#34; wide. But I've grown to like the size. Craftsmanship is A++."
4.0,Pretty nice little loose and heart was a little bigger than I expected but still looks nice!
4.0,"The watch looks really pretty and classy. The band is very delicate. Seems to be good quality, not sure about the machine, I just started using it. I had received one that didn‚Äôt work, probably the battery was dead, and they sent me a new one right away."
4.0,i like them.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but packaged in the most obnoxious tiny styrofoam balls. That exploded while opening box. We actually thought it was a joke at first until we found the box.
4.0,Great to show my Michigan pride
4.0,"Was a gift, but haven't heard anything bad yet."
4.0,A gift to a friend who is well satisfied with jt.
4.0,Fit fine .
4.0,love the material and the style just wish it came with a bit more support
4.0,I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I have several of these and really like them.  These are a bit on the thin side (which can be a plus) but they're still a nice quality.
4.0,Hat looks good fits good. Snap back will not stay snapped had to tape.
4.0,"Great gloves, excellent fit and well made. Button loop is very difficult to unclasp with gloves on though, I added a small piece of yarn to make it easier."
4.0,The adjustable band fits great and doesn't rip your hair out lol which is common with these types of bands. The magnet is very strong. The removable locking bars are kind of a pain to keep in while you're changing bands. They come with a spare but there was a set either glued in or a better way to keep them from sliding out. The other band is great quality and feels very nice on your wrist. This package DOES NOT COME WITH A PIN REMOVAL TOOL TO REMOVE LINKS. So you'd better buy one unless your wrist is the size of a small tree.
4.0,"This sweatshirt fit great great through the body but the arms are way to huge and long, will still wear it but it's pretty annoying."
4.0,This T-shirt fits as expected and is super soft!
4.0,It was nice material but way too small in the bust.
4.0,"This is really cute and a fun shirt to wear.  You don't have to wear a camisole under it, but the arm holes are really big.  I feel more comfortable putting something under it."
4.0,Cute dress but wish it was actually burgundy instead of bright red
4.0,Really nice ties
4.0,"Too small for my sisters head, otherwise ok"
4.0,This feel great and fit well.  The feet feel like they could be a little tighter but over all I think they work well.
4.0,Wonderful design! The strength is as I expected and the chain actually had the correct length to it. The finish seems to be holding up just great. No problems with reading the inscription either.
4.0,This dress was surprisingly very comfortable. It's a perfect dress to lounge around in.
4.0,"I am quite pleased with these!  Came with a giftbox, each earring in its own small bag so as not to scratch one another, an extra pair of backs, a purple carry-bag, and a small cleaning cloth.  They are pretty heavy for their size and appear to be of good quality.  The zircons are beautiful!  Pretty happy, especially for less than 10 bucks!"
4.0,"It looked a lot nicer in person, I was positively surprised. No idea how it will work or wuality since it is a gift and I can't rate my experience with the watch."
4.0,Great band for the price! Color is as pictured. Would purchase another one
4.0,Not the highest quality but it works to get through airport security quickly (very important when traveling with small children).
4.0,Nice product. Good quality.<br />Bit smal on size.
4.0,"Super soft, very comfortable, does not irritate your skin, I was breaking out with other masks and so far I have used it for a month ( 8 hours a day) and definitely love it."
4.0,This bag is roomy and a great go to city bag. Only thing I wish it had a little longer strap.
4.0,"Update* 2/1/2020: I ended up buying these same exact pants at a different department store since they were on sale for $9.99 plus a small shipping fee. They were not as loose, felt more snug, and the tags inside match the tags in this one, but way less than what the price is here on amazon. A bit disappointed since both were a size 6 average. Not sure why the sizes would be different. Lowered to 4 stars since they are the same exact size/average/missy size 6, but Amazon's was more loose.<br /><br />I originally bought a pair of these on clearance at a department store, but they were 6petite. I am so happy to finally have a pair in regular length. I love the weight of these pants that I can wear in a business casual environment at work. As many who work in an office knows, it is always chilly! Lol. I will definitely be ordering more once payday hits!"
4.0,It is nice watch
4.0,Very nice thick well built belt.  I ordered a black and a brown.  The brown is a very dark brown hard to tell the black and brown a part.  The one bad thing is the recommended going a size bigger then what you where.  When you order order the size you wear waist size and don‚Äôt size up
4.0,Major upset that one of the boxes came broke. But overall all good and a couple rows down fit my nose piercing thankfully. Also make sure you clean the piercings really good before you put them in because mine smelled like burnt styrofoam so I made to clean it before trying and keeping it in
4.0,Very pretty but didn't like chain so I put it on a different chain.
4.0,"The charm was smaller than I expected, but the detail is great.  Overall, a lovely bracelet that I haven‚Äôt taken off!"
4.0,"I got mine as a XL. They fit more like a medium. The length was there, but felt tapered around the legs. Not exactly what I was looking for. I bought a pair like these that were the same size that fit great before ‚Äútapered‚Äù became a thing. If that‚Äôs your thing, then these are the ones for you. If not, then no."
4.0,I loved this shirt.  I wear it all the time.  I would say that this shirt does run true to size.  The only issue is that the sleeves are long.
4.0,I LOVE these flip flops. It is true that they run big and I have never had that happen in my life.
4.0,This is an awesome mask.<br /><br />Pros: oddly enough you can see clearly through the eye slits. I received it the following day of ordering and it came in perfect condition. The antennas actually stay up like they do in the preview picture<br /><br />Cons: The antennas can sometimes bend forward if you make sudden head movements but this can be easily fixed by using straws (literally the ones you can get a a fast food restaurant).<br /><br />HIghly recommended for Hotline MIami cosplayers
4.0,"I believe these were advertised as Polarized, however when tested, they are not.<br />But I do like them"
4.0,"This necklace is cute and good quality. I have a rather large chest so certain length necklaces don't work for me and that was my only issue with this necklace. I think the value is there for the price, this one is not a cheapy. I had to return but only because of the length wasn't right for me."
4.0,It's so cute and for the price simply unbeatable! It however is extremely sheer. So I recommend you wear a cami underneath but it did run small. REALLY SMALL. I wear xs to S in American size and I fit the XL. 5'3&#34; and 110. Not busty either but the shirt is a bit tight.. for my first cosplay I love this and with such fast shipping (I only waited a week and a half!!) I cannot deny I am so highly satisfied ^^
4.0,"I love this dress. I am 5'5&#34;, and 150 pounds, 38C chest. I ordered the medium in the dark grey and it fit well. It was not too tight and not too baggy. It is comfortable. The only downside is that the bottom of the dress is smaller. Meaning the dress narrows a bit after the knees. This sometimes makes it hard to walk quickly, go up stairs or cross your legs without showing your calf/lower leg. I just wear leggings under it. The fabric was like a tee-shirt material. I love that it has pickets. I will probably order another. It did NOT look like a nightgown/house dress, which I was thankful for. I previously bought a dress from a different seller, in light grey and it looked like a house dress."
4.0,The model must be size zero and very short because it is not that long on me and it is not as oversized as it is on the model.  I still liked it and it fits and is a good weight.
4.0,Somewhat shorter than expected but I gave to my daughter and she loves it for layering!
4.0,Thin material. It's somewhat big.
4.0,"order 1 or 2 sizes up, that what I did. Its nice for cool days and very comfortable"
4.0,Yellow bow ripped as I was taking it off my daughter's head. Quality of it may not last long.
4.0,"Snug for an 11 , but not to bad."
4.0,A gift to a very delighted recipient!  She wears them often!
4.0,"Not really a scarf for a child, it‚Äôs too long.  More for an adult"
4.0,Very Stylish and fits perfectly. Good product.
4.0,"Made nice, looks beautiful, just one important con- material on the top is thin."
4.0,"This shirt runs smaller than usual USA sizes.  But I happen to be losing weight, so I'm keeping it...it will eventually fit."
4.0,"Not sure about the slight shine in material, looks a little cheap. Fit good , maybe just not me . I do like the pockets"
4.0,"Cute and as expected. The length is great, and it looks like the photo. The only caveat is the lace fabric part is low quality and kind of thick (no stretch really), and it's slightly uncomfortable. I wish the lace was semi stretchy and softer for comfort but its cute so I'll be keeping it. Would look nice with some skinny pants for the holidays."
4.0,Very cute for the price I paid and came with multiple pads to change out colors and scents. Packaging was very nice in a little necklace bag.
4.0,I will enjoy wearing these.I like the way they sparkle and the color is nice. They are worth the price.
4.0,It's a really great sweater just way too big I kept it anyway and wear it around the house
4.0,"I thought it would be smaller, but I still love it. Gets the job done!"
4.0,"I like the bra, but I wish I would have ordered a small. I'm a 30 D and it said a medium would fit me, and it does, but is a bit too loose. I like mine tight."
4.0,17 year old daughter loved!
4.0,Very nice quality and more sparkle in person.
4.0,Granddaughter says tight in shoulder
4.0,Good for thr price
4.0,"Perfect for what I needed them for (white party)- cheap, but lasted the night.  They aren't strong/durable/super comfortable plastic, but for $2 I wasn't expecting, or wanting them to be.  They were comfortable for the day.  They are a little on the larger side as they are unisex (although, I usually have a problem finding glasses which are not too big on me), but they looked fine on me.  I will still wear them on occasion, and they will last awhile.  Overall, good for the price and use."
4.0,They look good they are a little fragile but that‚Äôs okay we use them a lot and they are really good
4.0,"Nothing too fancy, a bit on the short side, but then again I've not bought ties in a very long time.  The one complaint I have is that they're very sensitive.  Mine have snagged a few times and left little strings sticking out of them.  But 6 ties for the price you get what you pay for.  I do have to say that I LOVE some of the colors, the purple and gold ones really pop.  All the colors are very vibrant."
4.0,"I am 5'9 and 130 lbs and found the 8 to fit the best. HOWEVER - They fit great in the leg and tush but they are a bit too long. I am not too fond of the big red lettering on the rear pocket &#34;Sassoon&#34;. But hey, at only 13.99 on sale - it's ok. The zipper is of very poor quality though.<br /><br />Do I recommend them? - yes, if you have longer legs."
4.0,It was a pretty dress but it runs smaller than I expected.
4.0,"very cute, but a bit pricey"
4.0,"I am not 100% sure I need all the extra pockets this has to offer. However; I love the fact it is protecting the inside of my designer bag. I will buy another for my work tote, where I will use the multiple pockets and storage options. Great price, nice material and neutral color. I would highly recommend this product."
4.0,Beautiful!! They are really big on the lobes off your ear though.
4.0,"I love this purse.  I've been using it for about 4 months now.  It's made really well and I love the buckle details.  I like smaller purses - they prevent me from hauling around too much crap.  Despite my love for smaller purses, this one is a bit too small.  I also thought the price was a bit high, thus 4 stars."
4.0,"These are very comfortable when standing/walking.  They are a little snug across the thighs, bottom seem could use a relief cut.  They've done fine with washing, I line dry, I find it easier to keep the flaps from folding and curling"
4.0,It's a nice quality hat but a bit expensive.
4.0,"My only complaint at all is that it's a little short for a tall girl, but other than that it's amazing for this price. I'm 5'7&#34; and 135 pounds and the medium fits like a glove, but the length is a little short, comes to right above the ankle. I'm keeping it anyway because no one else will even notice and the rest of it fits me so cute and perfect. Great purchase."
4.0,"Great for a Halloween costume that you'll only wear once. Pretty cheaply made, but that is expected."
4.0,The only problem was that the logo was not centered. Otherwise love it
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress! The fit is very flattering! I ordered the Large and am 5‚Äô4, 160 pounds. It didn‚Äôt cling to my middle at all. Only reason it‚Äôs 4 stars is the neckline. In the picture it looks to be at about the collar bone, but it was much higher on me. At $20, it‚Äôs one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made."
4.0,"The fabric is sweatshirt material and it is so soft. I wasn't expecting it to be soft but I like it. The neckline allows for it to be off one shoulder but isn't quite wide enough so I'm just going to, carefully, cut the collar part off. I like everything else about it so I will keep it."
4.0,"Love the pattern and make, but this item runs large.  I am a 40 suit size, 32 waist but needed to exchange for a small from a medium.  I still needed to cinch the back strap to the smallest possible length to have it fit properly against the body without it looking too big."
4.0,This is fashionable reader. but a bit tight for me.
4.0,"My go to shorts.  Fit well, durable, look good."
4.0,Cute pants nice fit
4.0,Love it so adorable.. Can't wait to see my baby in it when he/she arrives in Novemberüòç
4.0,"This has been a life saver-- or more to the point an a** saver-- every week when I sit on metal bleachers for 2 hrs, so I can watch my kid at diving lessons."
4.0,"These seemed super cute, perfect for to and from yoga class or just to wear as comfy sandals on any given warm weather day. I read a number of the reviews before purchasing so I expected them to run a little bit small, be a a bit on the narrow side, possibly &#34;flop&#34; more than the average &#34;flip-flop,&#34; and possibly have issues with the straps slipping off one's ankle. That being said, they were still cute enough and the price was right. I purchased them in a size EU 40, which is what I usually purchase being a US 8.5. I went with the black ones because that's just how I roll.<br /><br />They arrived well-packaged in an envelope- no big bulky box or over the top packing materials. Just a sturdy shipping envelope. The sandals come in a carrying pouch, which is nice (although not necessary). They look just like the listing photo and are exactly as described in the listing details. The sole material and base are sturdy, but still cushy and comfy. I also love that they're made put of recycled materials; definitely a bonus! The strap material is soft and comfy, but definitely very stretchy so I get that there's the potential for them to become too stretched out over time or with lots of repeated use. The sandals fit pretty much as expected and I wouldn't say they run super small. They do run on the narrow side though and that's worth considering when/if you decide to purchase them. They do &#34;flop&#34; more than the average &#34;flip-flop&#34; so if that sort of thing bothers you, then you might want to keep looking for a different sandal. I didn't find it annoying at all though.<br /><br />In general, they are cute and comfy sandals. For the cost, they're better than anything you'd pickup at a big box store on a whim. I think they're nice quality and nice looking. Good sandals, but not great.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,Much prettier than pictured. For the cost I expected the garment to be professional finished. I haven't had the opportunity to wear it yet since I just received it. Hopefully it will wear well
4.0,"I bought these for my 4 yr old. They are very cute and somewhat thicker than other tights she owns. However, its a bit tight for her, but then again she is tall and big for her age. I will buy again tho but will size up."
4.0,These are super cute. Some of them were put on the earring fixing things backwards. When I tried to turn then they broke and I had to put a new earring backs. Some of them worked fine and some of them were made correctly. All of the gummy bears seemed perfect only the lollipops needed to be adjusted.
4.0,It‚Äôs rather large and seems to be made from very flimsy material. Will see if it can hold up to the Texas sun and track use.
4.0,My daughter loves this dress. However we waited more than  6 weeks for it ...
4.0,"I like this headband especially for when I get ready in the morning. It holds everything back with I move around the house (my hair is always the last thing I do since it‚Äôs so crazy, curly, and time consuming). I wish this headband was a little looser on my head but that‚Äôs just a personal preference. Overall a wonderful headband!"
4.0,I was expecting it to be on the small side after seeing other reviews so it worked out for me. It is defintely a slim medium as I have a 31 inch waist and I wouldn't want it any smaller. Love the retro look and functionality for cross-training.
4.0,"almost 5 stars, but it sits sorta big overtop of the existing cap"
4.0,I used it for my Halloween costume. The bangs were very long but overall it was pretty nice
4.0,Great for all occasions!!
4.0,"Top to small for size, but return was easy and ordered a size 5."
4.0,It's cute . I bought it for swim class it stretched out a little after a few months. But worth the price
4.0,"-This shirt fits great, and the material is very soft and comfortable.<br /><br />-The shirt is fitted to you and stays where it is, you don't have to worry about the bottom of it rolling up!  It falls just below my waist as far as fit goes.<br /><br />-Very flattering, I like the high neck line.  This shirt is heavy enough to wear alone or would be a great addition as an under shirt.<br /><br />-I feel like the price is a little high personally for just a plain tank, otherwise I would probably own one in every color."
4.0,"color is more of a dark gray.  material is thin, but I like that as I get too warm easily. could be just a little longer for me, I am 5'6&#34;."
4.0,"This jersey is a nice pattern which is why I ordered it. The material is a little thicker than a lot of other jerseys I have and it is a lot longer than the others. I ordered an XL (3XL) which is usually a little big on me but then my husband can also wear it. This jersey is a lot larger than most other brands so unfortunately I probably won't wear it but I still like it. It has a decent quality zipper, back sewn in pockets, and the gel grip on the bottom of the jersey but not the sleeves. I had to wait for this jersey to arrive for approximately 3 weeks."
4.0,"Love the look and fit, just keep in mind it does shrink a bit in the wash. I wear with shorts underneath because it gets to be too short after first wash."
4.0,i  would love it if the leggings wouldn't roll down when they're on!!!!! PLEASE ANYBODY HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?!? it's no good to buy slimming leggings when they ROLL DOWN! dah!
4.0,Nice to take around with just a few things
4.0,My niece was delighted to receive this as a gift for her 5th birthday. As this type of item goes the quality is good and the design is super cute.
4.0,"Dress looks and fits nicely. The fabric is a little stiff and not super high quality. The sash looks terrible (cheap ribbon that came all twisted and wrinkled), so I bought a nice satin ribbon and made my own. You get what you pay for. I'm very excited to wear this dress to a wedding."
4.0,"My bf got these for his MMA practice because we thought theyd be more silicon like and flexible. They are not very flexible, just plastic. They are nice for everyday wear and okay for sports (better than metal). There are a TON of pieces which is nice because there is a huge variety. So if youre getting these for a combat sport, you might want to look elsewhere but if youre getting these for everyday wear then theyll be just fine! (:"
4.0,Didn't realize that I couldn't remove the horn to place on my other chain but it is nice.
4.0,These were soo comfortable! They were high waisted yet didn‚Äôt cut me off or roll down! Will buy again!!!!
4.0,"So far, so good. We‚Äôll see how long they last. Similar types in the past have not lasted very long. I hope these are different."
4.0,"These shoes are very adorable. Nice gold color and seem like a durable fabric (probably not leather).  The only issue I have with these are that one shoe has a little bend in the tongue, which the seller says it's standard. I'm worried that it will bother my little one's foot, but only time will tell. The shoes run a little large.  Overall, these are very adorable and I'm happy I have them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Nice leggings, love the 2 pockets on either side. I also like the length. They come down just a little lower than most pants like this do and hit below my calf instead of right on it which is what i wanted. The waist is high but i wish it was a little higher in the back. They kind of droop a bit and slide down to where i need to yank them up quite often. Definitely size up one. I normally wear a medium but the large fits well. 5'4"" 145-150lbs"
4.0,Great quality for the price. Fit true to size.
4.0,"Not the best support, but ok."
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars bc it's cute and exactly what I wanted but because it comes folded, there are wrinkles in it I can't seem to get rid of when I tried steaming the hat."
4.0,"It looks my my butt has permanent sweat stains. So many people tried to be nice and politely tell me ""my butt has a stain"" or marks, or rips etc etc. I embarrassingly have to tell ""it's on purpose"". I ended up giving them to my SIL. She wore them once and then gave them away to someone else haha...the leggings are pretty comfy but the style looks bad. People will do a DOUBLE CHECK with you...but not In a good way. I would look for the kind that does not have the breathable mesh layer near the butt. It just comes out looking real weird...real weird! Check out the photos..you'll see what I mean<br /><br />I'm 6 months PP. 155lbs, 5'6, large calves and thighs. Wider hips. 36 B bra. I bought a medium but could have gotten a large. They run small."
4.0,Loved this to complete my outfit for family pictures. Durable enough for the baby to grab and pull too.
4.0,"Good quality for the price, Not as good as others but these straps were great for the price! With how well they work and how fast they ship it is worth it to buy."
4.0,This product is exactly what I expected.
4.0,Concerned it will loose it' silver coating over time.
4.0,"Poor quality,  cheaply made..tongue sewn to sides of laces..awkward ripples when timing laces."
4.0,"My granddaughter just had a PJ's Equestrian Girls b'day party! She just turned 9! I sent the PJ's to her & they arrived in the nick of time! She loves them but the 10/12 looked a bit small especially the top which should have been quite a bit longer! She won't be able to wear them too long! However, the birthday girl was quite happy which made Grandma happy too! üëçüèºüôãüèªCheryl"
4.0,"Nice looking cardigan, but if you plan on buttoning it while wearing, you may want to think about buying up a size"
4.0,Good....
4.0,Love it!  Bought a matching one for my daughter too!!
4.0,Supper cute but it was too big for me
4.0,Good quality/price
4.0,Breathable fabric! Recommend for ppl with hair
4.0,Nice bracelet but runs small. Bought it for my husband but it didn‚Äôt fit. Luckily my daughter liked it!
4.0,Loved this choker! The hamsa is a bit small but it's still super cute.
4.0,"will dry in very quickly if they get wet, could be used as a bathing suit"
4.0,Great product - works as advertised. If you have a smaller head you might find the width to be a little too much at 2.5‚Äù. I wish Nike would come out with a product that‚Äôs 1.5‚Äù that would be perfect
4.0,"The bag was small, but not smaller than I thought it would be. It came in earlier than the expected delivery time and it looked exactly as I anticipated it to be. Can't wait to use it for my upcoming trip to Disneyland and Philippines :)"
4.0,"Beautiful and soft material, does not scratch up my neck."
4.0,runs a bit small but it's comfortable
4.0,"Worth $100? Debatable, But They Work And Have A Good Look For Bigger Faces. (These Are Probably My 4th Pair Of Sabres)"
4.0,I got this dress today.  Fits well but in the picture the top part of the dress seems longer.  The elastic on me is above my belly button.  I would of thought the elastic would be lower.  It is very comfortable and I will still wear it but would prefer it sit a bit lower.  Kind of makes it look a bit like a maternity dress.  I am 5'2&#34; and usually wear a small or medium.  I ordered a medium for this dress.
4.0,"Beautiful designs, light weight but thinner than I anticipated. It runs on the tight dude and I have a small face."
4.0,"The product fit well, the shirt is soft and comfy, and the image on the shirt matches the description.<br />The one thing that isn‚Äôt great, is that the image/appliqu√© has begun peeling off after one wash. I washed it in cold water and line dried the shirt."
4.0,Came quickly in the mail.  Material is very nice.  I haven't worn it out or washed it yet.  The back is very cute.  The front is a little short but I can make it work.  I don't think the back is as long as they show in the pictures but I do really like it.  I bought an XL and normally wear a size 14 in bottom and M/L on top.
4.0,Very nice earrings. Seem like they are well made. My husband made a nice choice.
4.0,I‚Äôm not totally sure if these stones are real or dyed since they‚Äôre almost clear. They‚Äôre smooth and small so they can still be used making jewelry
4.0,I'm a tour guide at Ruby Falls.  The people on my tours are able to understand the information I'm giving them much more clearly through this mask.  The minor downside is that my glasses fog up more in the 60 degree cave with this mask than with some others.  That doesn't happen at more normal room temperatures.
4.0,"These are nice for wearing around the house, good no slip protection.  I like them"
4.0,"Bought these at the request of my grandson. He loved Space Jam & loves these as well . He put them on his crocs immediately! A little pricey, but made him very happy!"
4.0,purchased for a female who weighs 110#.  Small would have worked but no complaints;still comfortable and will be nice come the fall.
4.0,"My necklace is great, and I've been happy with it in general.  But I must admit that I was disappointed when my colored stripes came in a non-rainbow order.  My red is above the blue and the purple is below the orange.  It's not a total deal breaker, but there's something to be appreciated about a rainbow in its proper order.  Even the picture displayed here seems to have flipped the orange and red.  Why?"
4.0,"This scarf is suuuuper soft and I absolutely love it! The only thing is that the yellow in it is more of a neon yellow, so slightly different from the picture."
4.0,They are absolutely gorgeous but I normally wear a large got an XL and they just barely fit. Great material tho very pretty
4.0,Very cute however it fit quite big.
4.0,It's a thinner felt type material but it held up well with 25 kids throwing it around at a birthday party.
4.0,"This is now probably going to be my favorite to wear dress basically. I would love to see more products similar to this and in more color, and size varieties without the heart on it. This Item would be nice in a size or 2 larger so that the sleeves fit me how I like them to fit."
4.0,"For the price it‚Äôs not bad but there‚Äôs no way that this is going to fit. An xl says it would fit a 42E-F. That‚Äôs definitely not true as that‚Äôs the size I wear and compared to other sports bras I have that do fit, this is about 2-3 sizes smaller. My chest would be spilling out of it everywhere if I tried to wear it. I am going to keep it as I‚Äôm trying to lose weight and the price isn‚Äôt bad for a back up bra."
4.0,"This glass is sturdy, fashionable and sleek. The quality is great. I would give it 10 stars. Garnet is not red."
4.0,Love them. Wish they were thicker.
4.0,Very comfortable felt like wearing PJs
4.0,"there ok not very fashionable but got it for $14 with slick deals coupon, mainly for work so its ok, def is polarized and for $14 worth it. wouldn't been happy paying retail, not worth it."
4.0,I'm giving this shirt 4 stars because I though it had more of an oversize fit which it doesn't but it's still cute
4.0,Cute... only thing is that the bow on one foot started to fall apart.
4.0,"This is a really cute top, but like the other reviews said, I fully expect the anchor to fade within a few washes.  It was pretty inexpensive though, and it's really comfortable, so I'm still quite happy with it.  I love the adorable little bow at the back, and it fits really well! I bought an XL so it would be nice and loose, and it flows just like I wanted it to.<br /><br />  One thing I really like about this top is that it's not super thin.  I was expecting this to be so thin that it would be see through, but nope! It's actually a nice, thick material and there's no camisole needed underneath.  Overall, it's a great little top for the money, and I'm really hoping the anchor holds up.  Even if it fades, I'll still get quite a bit of use out of it, though!"
4.0,Nice and comfortable shorts.
4.0,It's a bit boxy and needs to be taken in at the waist.
4.0,Look as pictured.
4.0,"This is the second pair I bought as a gift. The first were to big ,but seemed nice and came in a nice box. The second pair I dropped 1 full size and reordered. These didnt come in a box just in plastic and have a strong unpleasant smell that the first pair didnt have."
4.0,Not too much today other than they do what they are meant to.
4.0,Excellent swimming goggles for me. They do scratch relatively easily so you shouldn't use them for other purposes as I did( I used them to protect my eyes from herbicides while spraying because my usual eye protection was missing). Limbs scratch them easily
4.0,Purchased for my six year old grandson and it‚Äôs too big for a little kid.
4.0,"This is what I call my 'Firkin', due to its undeniable similarity to the much more costly designer version by Hermes. Since I couldn't yet afford the real deal, this seemed like a wonderful alternative. Although I was a little hesitant in getting it as I wasn't familiar with the brand's standard of quality, I have been very happy with my purchase so far (bought it about a month ago) and get many compliments on the color (Cognac) and design.<br /><br />The bag is roomy and can fit plenty of items, including letter-sized notebooks and folders without getting them bent. I like the sturdy base, as the bag doesn't sink down even if it is heavy and always remains well-supported. One thing that I wish I knew how to fix is that a few days after buying it, the bag began to flop over the front when I set it on the ground and no longer stands up straight. A minor quirk but I am worried that the leather might start to crease. The leather quality is good for its price, a little shiny but not noticeable. The straps are holding up well and I especially love the classy buckle lock detail.<br /><br />For its price, this is certainly an elegant and well-crafted bag."
4.0,Loved it. Just what I wanted. Except too large for my wrist. If it was just a bit smaller I would rate a 5+
4.0,really cute...cheap sunglasses for the money. YOU get the look without the high dollar price.
4.0,If we are forced to wear mask why not sequin. Look great in person
4.0,"Our last name is Donatello, so I just had to buy several of these for my grown children.  I took away 1 star because a couple of them broke from the keychain. Not really broke, just came apart. Once I squeezed the metal circle thing together, they were fine. Also a few were out of their package, but that wasn't a big deal.  My family loves this."
4.0,"They're fine, a cheap pair of flip-flops that do the job.  Nothing special about them, they're a foam panel that goes on your feet for $14, nuff said."
4.0,Very light and cute.  So far no complaints from my daughter
4.0,"This skirt was a strange fit for me. I am a tall, curvy girl, and this was a little TOO curve-hugging! It's cute but a little too much for golfing."
4.0,Colors are perfect for my new coat I ordered! Nice and soft material!
4.0,I could not tell you what it look like because it was shipped to my granddaughter not to me and she won‚Äôt open it until Christmas thank you
4.0,Great value for the mobey. No springs on the arms but for the price it's fine.
4.0,I like the fit around my thighs. I just order a size too big. But great overall
4.0,"The shirt arrived earlier than I expected! What a pleasant surprise. It is soft and comfortable. Although, I have to say it has more of a &#34;batwing&#34; shape compared to the picture. I would have preferred for it to have a plain t-shirt shape but I still like it."
4.0,Ordered 3 more...runs big
4.0,They were to big and I had to pay to send them back for a exchange
4.0,Too big but I love it.  Very warm.
4.0,Nice material. Good fit. Love the color and design. Great buy.
4.0,"Pretty cool mask. Kinda hangs down at my chin, dosent quite fit snugly. I really like the style and fabric, very comfortable on the ears."
4.0,Words are a little blurry but still readable
4.0,Looks cool.... Once I realized it's automatic and therefore it has to be reset/wound from time to time it's a nice watch.
4.0,"gift for my daughter, she likes them, no show socks. was hoping they were a little more no show so she could wear them with her flats"
4.0,"The good: It fits great for my height (5'7"") and doesn't drag when I wear boots. Sits well and doesn't pull on your throat when you flip it back.  It is well made, and looks awesome with my cosplay outfit. The loop and button closure meant I didn't have to put a hole in it with my cloak pin, so that's a great addition.<br /><br />The bad: It came smelling of something like cigarette smoke; that seems to have faded. I was hoping it would be a tad heavier, too.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5 stars. Definitely grab this is it's ever on sale. I paid $50... Way over my budget but it looks like it will last me for a long time."
4.0,"Necklace is so pretty on, nice color and seems decent quality. Only 4 stars because the chain was in a huge knotted mess upon arrival"
4.0,"Cute top, nice colors, nice fit! The only problem is the material will snag easily if it catches on something."
4.0,"nice belt, slide latch takes some getting used to"
4.0,Performs as expected. I was right great product. I will reorder when this one wears out.
4.0,To be on the safe side go up a size or 2
4.0,Breathable and Light fabric.  the edges are not hemmed.
4.0,Great for work. So light and comfy.
4.0,"Would have been 5 stars but material wrinkles easily. Good fit 5,5 145lbs."
4.0,Very easy to attach made my fit watch new again!!!
4.0,"Am 5.8&#34; and 158lbs. Normally a medium means the pants are too short, which means not hitting the shoe or barely. Was reading in other reviews how the pant legs are long. I can see how they are longer than many but BARELY hitting the top of the shoe. Sending back for a large. The thighs and back fit nice, snug but they are flattering. Material is thin and the water repellent, but does not make that &#34;swushing&#34; sound that some repellent products make."
4.0,"Nice quality. The baby wore it once and spilled something brown on it. Not sure what it was since he is still on formula. It may run a bit small, but  my baby is fat."
4.0,"The right size, a bit delicate, but love them!"
4.0,This is my second Dog is Good scrub top. My clients love them and so do I.
4.0,I couldn‚Äôt see a picture of the back of the product! I sill like it though!
4.0,I gave this item to my sister for a graduation and she loved it. It seems to be put together well.
4.0,"This color blue is amazing! It's so vibrant!! I got many compliments on this outfit when I wore it to work. The fabric is a stretchy, soft, and acrylic type make. I think this will be good in the long run as sometimes fitted garments like this pill up or wear out quickly. The silkiness of the fabric also allows for your pants and legs to glide effortlessly. The belt is less impressive, just a basic brown/black reversible thin belt, but it's plastic feeling make-up makes me question it's durability. I use a different belt. The nice thing is, the belt loops are big enough that you can play with the belt size, depending on your mood and desire. I also really liked that the buttons come up far enough to not flash everyone, but you can also unbutton them to reveal a little more if you'd like, without looking unnatural. Fits mostly true to size though I did find the torso to be a little short, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Even though I have what I'd consider a normal size torso, I had to pull crotch down more than once, to make sure there was no camel toe. The pant length is perfect though! I wore some open toed wedges with a light jacket and people loved it! One person said it reminded him of his home country, Puerto Rico, with the brightness of the color and the flowing fit of the pant leg. I felt sexy and comfortable, win/win! I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for looking lovely and comfortable then writing my honest review. That's a really great deal. I love reading other people's reviews, and base my purchases on them, so I strive to give others the same kind of advice and feedback."
4.0,"They are really cute and look like the picture.  A little large, but I am happy because then they can grow into it."
4.0,I bought a size up like other reviewers suggested. The material is a little cheap but so is the price so it was expected. Overall it's cute and I would buy it again
4.0,Lovely item.  Perfect fit. Fabric nice and soft.
4.0,I am 5‚Äô2 and I had to shorten it several inches and it‚Äôs still too long. I got an xl and normally wear a 16. I received a lot of compliments the day I wore it.
4.0,"It's a pretty nice sleep shirt. It's long, which is great if you're tall. It's also really soft, but it doesn't seem to be holding up exceptionally well. There's a little bit of pilling after a few months, although it's really not that big of a deal."
4.0,"I usually wear an 8, which I ordered, but they were too big so I returned and got a 7. They‚Äôre like walking on air but the upper straps are loose. I have a thin foot, so if you have a slightly  chubby or chubbier foot they should be great"
4.0,Loved this dress and had high exceptions. I had two of these dresses order for my daughters who are flower girls and were attending the bridal shower. Perfect because it had flower design on the bottom. I would have given this 5 stars but the pearl flower broach on one side of the strap on both dress I found out at the shower when it came off that they were glued on instead of sown on. Really??? So embarrassed as both of them were dangling on my daughters dresses at the shower and when pictures were taken of them. Looked like expensive dresses but made very cheap. Make sure if you consider buying to secure broach by sowing them on.
4.0,"The fit was comfortable. Definitely not for high impact workouts or the larger chested. More casual for tshirt/tank wearing. They do have a very chemical smell that didn‚Äôt come out in the wash. I soaked them in vinegar and baking soda for a few hours then washed them and it seemed to do the trick. The inserts did fall apart, but I typically toss them anyways. So for the money good buy, but does require a little work to clear the chemical smell."
4.0,These slippers are really cute. They are a bit wide but have great arch support in them. They arrived quickly and looked exactly how they are pictured. When I need another pair I will definitely buy these again.
4.0,"Cute style, thin fabric but not see through, good coverage on the bottom. .. As expected for such a reasonable price.  I'm pleased overall."
4.0,"These furry sandals/slippers are precious on little girl feet.  Everyone's into the unicorn craze, and I know my 2 year old niece doesn't know anything about it, but I thought these sweet slippers would give a touch of that rainbow goodness to her.  I got the dark pink and purple fur, and they are great!  Quality is not as good as name-brand, but still good enough since she'll outgrow them in a few months."
4.0,Update:<br />Its super durable! Only problem is its either to tight or to loose and sliding around so its kind of annoying and I am buying a different band. But it is cute and it is durable!<br /><br />Original:<br />So cute and took me less then a minute to take off the old one and put this one on! Seems durable but I just got it today. I'll update this if it breaks but if I don't it's durable! I work with horses so I need something remotely tough!
4.0,Much better quality than expected!
4.0,I have a relatively thin wrist (50mm) I had to be more careful about the case sizing of the watch. It was way bigger for my wrist and I had to fasten the band to the last two holes which ended up hurting my wrist. Don't get me wrong it is a very luxurious-looking watch with a casual sporty appearance.
4.0,fit my need
4.0,"Didnt receive my first order due to problems along the shipping process but promptly received a replacement hassle free. The graphics are great. Ive already gotten compliments. Only problem I have is they're a bit thicker than I'd like and make it a little harder for others to understand your words. Other than that great product, as pictured."
4.0,They are as advertised. Easy to use and attrective
4.0,"Beautiful print and it fit as expected. I found that it looked better without a petticoat - but then that depends on the look your going for. The top was revealing though since I'm quite busty but otherwise it was a beautiful dress,"
4.0,"I just got these in the mail and they are so cute! Great oversized sunglasses and they were packaged super nice so I know they were new and in good condition when they arrived. Only reason these have 4 stars is because the part that goes on my nose seems a bit tight but I‚Äôm hoping that loosens up over time. Otherwise, perfect!"
4.0,These are all perfect however cheaply made material don't sweat nor wear them in the summer because I had a black ring around my neck
4.0,"Other than it being a little long, I love everything about it! I ordered a large the first time then reordered a different color in a medium. Both are wonderful."
4.0,Cute heart necklace
4.0,Cute little inexpensive necklace.
4.0,Mine does not look exactly like that
4.0,Loved the fabric and all the useful pockets. Runs a bit large but I am a petite so maybe that the reason
4.0,LIKE THE COLOR AND VERY COMFORTABLE. I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL PAIRS OF D&G IN THE PAST. THESE ARE MY FAVORITE.
4.0,My wife loves these bags. And I'm coming around. They are very handy and it means less plastic grocery sacks in my house.
4.0,Great colors and designs. Just seems small for a 2T.
4.0,I bought these for my 3 year old twins for Christmas and they fit perfectly. I‚Äôm not sure how many more years they will fit but they‚Äôre super adorable and I wish they would wear them more!
4.0,"At first, I thought these were<br />Going to be right around my waist. I‚Äôm short and thick around the middle. But they fit pretty great, snug but not tight if that makes<br />Sense!"
4.0,"My wife usually wears XL and we bought XL but they fit more like a medium. She can just get into them. Order 2 sizes up. Other shorts on Amazon, size XL fit her."
4.0,I purchased these for work to cover tattoos. They work well and they create a cooling effect. That's the most important thing for me since the elderly take it to 11 with the heat whether it be June or December.<br />The downside is that the tops have a tendency to roll down and require adjustments throughout my shift. They are not squishy arm friendly.
4.0,Haven't wore them yet but seems like quality
4.0,"Nice detail, Good quality ring"
4.0,"I decided to buy another pair of pants, but one up in size as the XL fit more like a Med-Lg. I truly like the fabric, feel and color. I'll give the XL to another."
4.0,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my mother who loves cats. She loved the necklace, pendent is very well made, however the chain is very short I would say about 16‚Äù, and not of the best quality the clasp makes the chain look inexpensive. The pendent does not come off the chain. We used a pair of jewelry pliers to remove the pendent and put it on a nicer chain, but the pendent is what it was bought for."
4.0,I usually wear Med but this fits very snug. I think a large would've have looked just as fitted but less constricting. I alternate Lee ordered a large and it's perfect. Kept both just in case I lose those extra Lbs!
4.0,"Economia, variedad"
4.0,"I really like my new sunglasses in this stylish red color. They are darker than the ones from Walgreens, cheaper, and more stylish. I wish they were even darker but they are definitely darker  than the pair I got from Walgreens. My only issue with them is handling glare on sunny days."
4.0,I love the purse & the price. The only thing I didn't  like is it didn't come with a storage cloth bag with it. Like my other purse did
4.0,These are smart looking and super comfy.  For Fall or Early Spring.
4.0,Different and interesting. I am enjoying wearing it.
4.0,"I bought this to try out the ratcheting style buckle.  The buckle mechanism works well, and appears to be sturdy enough to last.  I am pleased with the construction of the belt and buckle and will probably buy another at some point.  The corners are a bit sharp, just as shown in the picture.  I will look for one with a little bit of a radius on the corners for my next one."
4.0,Larger than expected order one size down
4.0,"Pros: Works perfectly, no need to remove the gloves to operate Iphone or Blackberry; are thin enough to put underneath gloves or mittens<br />Cons: Aren't warm. Probably good for a Houston or New Orleans winter, but not for winter in WI"
4.0,Great mask for the money. Would recommend to a friend.
4.0,"Maybe a little on the large size. The faux leather accent on the collar cheapens it a bit but overall, this is a comfy shirt."
4.0,The earrings are very pretty but I am afraid I will loose because the clasp are not working well
4.0,"This are definitely very small, I had to give them to my nieces which love them, it is very good quality hasn‚Äôt turn rusty or anything like that. Very sterling silver earrings at a good price!"
4.0,"I am super particular about fishing shirts because in the Southwest (Gulf of Mex) and in Sea of Cortez it can get brutally hot - way too many fishing shirts opt for a slim fit when way so many fishermen have a bit of girth on them from swilling drinks after a hard day fishing. I am 5'8&#34; 195# and the XL fit comfortably without being too snug.<br /><br />ALL of these polyester blend shirts they are coming out with nowadays lack ventilation, pockets, or an open V neck of half zipper to reduce heat. If they don't start adding these features I'm going to start my own brand and take their business from them. Nothing sucks more than wearing a snug long sleeve high neck shirt in 95 degree heat with 75% humidity. The only way to cool off with these is to CUT THE SLEEVES OFF AND CUT THE NECK OPEN WITH SCISSORS...it's a fishing shirt not a fashion piece. Rip it open and you will enjoy it much more in the summer seasons...."
4.0,Cute necklace. About like Avon  jewelry.
4.0,"Order 2 sizes up to look like the model.  Super tight on chest. Best for women with smaller chests and smaller hips OR you can just order 2 sizes up. In this case, they didn't have my size for me to do this. But great dress and material just too tight for my curves."
4.0,They were perfect for my project. One arrived with the silver scraped off the outside edge but otherwise ideal for my needs!
4.0,These earrings I would recommend to anyone who wants to look fresh! I rated it 4 stars because there were some problems me receiving this product but that was just USPS fault
4.0,These leggings are awesome i love the material. Just wish they actually had pockets attach to them. Other than that i love them ‚ù§‚ù§
4.0,"Upon first glance, before wearing it, looks to be on the smaller size of a senior large...we'll see."
4.0,"Pretty nice, I mean for the price the quality was ok. My husband thought it looked nice on me and it be a good spring dress."
4.0,I like the design and the idea of this innovative style of this watch. It's pretty good looking.<br />The problem that I found is the number (hour) is very thin and a quite small. The number must be bold in order to see it easily.<br /><br />The mesh band is pretty but the clasp does not stay closed all the time it has fallen off of my wrist.
4.0,I've only used a few times and they seem to work ok. I have prescription sunglasses but they aren't polarized so these really help in that aspect. And you can't see my regular glasses when I have these on which is a plus
4.0,"The threading on this purse is great, the purse is nice a large, big enough to fit my tablet, but small enough not to get in my way. i have been using this purse for a few days now and I am glad to say I a 100% happy with this product."
4.0,My wife loves this hand bag.
4.0,"I thought I had a big head, and I have trouble finding a cap that fits me (in particular, that's deep enough.)  Ordered one of these, and it covered my eyebrows and if any bigger, would have covered my eyes.  So returned it.  If you can't find a hat that fits you, try these, but it may be too big."
4.0,Fast shipping! Glad I ordered a XXL. Sizes run super small. I'm normally a large. The pants were great material and beautiful pattern. They fit perfect!
4.0,"Cute,but big on me and I ordered a small ."
4.0,Want to use them for photography and didn‚Äôt want to buy 90$ fractals so I‚Äôll disassemble these for the cool fractal glass. Will update with photos if it works! Otherwise they seem well made and would be sweet for festivals.
4.0,Cute but expected a little better quality until I realized the price point.  For limited use - it is a good sweater
4.0,"These are pretty good, I mean, obviously it is a great value!<br />They aren't even made really cheap, and out of the lot of 30 that are in the package, there was only 1 that I don't really like!<br />But, they are perfect, especially for anyone who is in the piercing business.<br />So many varieties to chose from, and much cheaper than buying them from somewhere like Spencers!"
4.0,I can't wait until the weather gets a little cooler so I can wear this with my leggings and boots. [[ASIN:B01N2Z3BWQ AMZ PLUS Women Large Size Vintage Lapel Long Sleeve Tunic Shirt Dress Blue 2XL]] Right now it is still in the 80-90's. The material is soft and it fits better than I expected. I am 5'7 1/4 and it was still a little long on me. I did read the reviews before ordering so bought a size larger than normal and it fits well. Color is a muted blue.
4.0,Stone not as dark as picture.
4.0,"Nice, but smaller than I thought,"
4.0,Cute little black dress.
4.0,"I appreciated the flexibility in this sandwich board style costume.  The donut image is flat so my daughter and I stuffed both sides and it looked much better, though it would have been fine without it.  She actually won the costume contest at her school for most colorful costume!"
4.0,Ideal for tall women. My only complaint is that they are not consistent. I bought a L and XL because I was not sure about my chest fitting (38F) and the arm holes on the XL are smaller than the L and the hanging fabric at tge chest is significantly smaller than the L. But great fit on both.
4.0,Super cute and fun for my daughter but I wish it weren't such a bright pink.
4.0,"Fit nicely!  I don't have big calves (regular size) but if you did, there is extra room.  They do have a rubbery smell that is taking some time to wear off.  I keep them in garage for now.  Smell seems to be lessening. But super cute!"
4.0,"This cover has very nice colors and feel, however it does not have a seam at the top and bottom. I do expect it to fray badly after a while."
4.0,These are floaty and flattering. Unfortunately they were too short after a single wash and line dry. They lost a few inches off the overall length.
4.0,"Cute, however at 5'1 it is a little long.....Girls look amazing though."
4.0,It is a small bag but my daughter loves it. Bought it as a gift since she is a cat lover.
4.0,"It is pretty. But it look fake too if you take a close look at it, especially the pearl. The surface of some was scratched. But undeniable, it's really beautiful."
4.0,Very cute! A bit smaller than I expected but I do like it!!
4.0,"Very nice, soft, ok quality."
4.0,it's very lightweight and fits well my small face well. good colors for construction or ppe. downside is the reflective strip runs straight down the nose because of the additional weight it suction to your nostrils and mouth while youre breathing. mesh airway fabric is best for the nose area for easy breathing. it keeps the sun off my cheeks and neck even if I have it pulled down in the front to expose my mouth and nose. it's soft and comfortable. for the price for 4 it's a great deal despite the reflective strip issue mentioned. quick delivery. it would be perfect without the reflective strip in my opinion.
4.0,Much larger and better put together than I expected. It's worth it if you have a lot of silver jewelry.
4.0,"This is a mens/unisex cut so the L/XL was pretty big, and definitely does not fit like the photo.  I kept it as it was for an upcoming party and kind of a joke anyway. It's a nice quality: the material is heavy and the (mane/ears/horn) design is adorable."
4.0,It's a very affordable peace of chain mail great for costumes that are not trying to be  historically correct. I was a little worried that it would not fit me being 6 FT &#34;1.8288 M&#34; tall and 170 LB &#34;77.1107 KG&#34; and if I was any bigger I don't think it would fit. this is not chain mail is not good for combat a sword can makes the rings be unwind creating a hole for your opponent can exploit. not as heavy as I thought it would be when worn. the mail also can be combined with aluminum mail ans still look good. I had no rings missing.
4.0,Bla bla bla
4.0,"Yes, it's smaller than what most adult men would prefer, the tiny green backlight is barely useful, the WR is minimal, but Casio sells over 3,000,000 of these babies a year; both Osama bin Laden and EX-PRESIDENT OBUMMER wore one at least occasionally and it earned the notorious name ""the terrorist watch"" due to its reliability and cheap price. (see wiki article)<br />I had to had to have one in my modest collection!!!"
4.0,Great summer/around the house dress
4.0,"Great dress, just too big,<br />Im 5'7&#34; and weigh 135, and usually wear a medium, and this was way big"
4.0,"However a beautiful shirt.,,"
4.0,The fit is okay. They are a little large in the crotch area.
4.0,Our 12 year old daughter loves i
4.0,Super cute sunglasses! Do a great job blocking the sun. Sturdy. And comes with a storage bag and cleaning cloth. Love these!
4.0,Did Uggs change their sizing? I am a size 6 and wore a Uggs size 5 but now I find it alittle snug
4.0,Nice belt. my husband liked it1
4.0,He loved the look!!
4.0,"I have a summer straw Fedora that has always been a little large if I'm currently wearing my hair cut short. I'd tried other products to make it fit better. This is the best so far. The width of the foam is almost 1 inch so it's wider than the others I've tried. Now my straw Fedora fits perfectly.<br /><br />I will admit that getting the backing peeled off to reveal the sticky side was challenging. Here's a tip. Once you measure the length you need, peel the backing down before you cut the foam piece. Then cut the foam piece but leave about a 1 inch long &#34;tail&#34; of the backing rather than cutting it even with the piece of foam liner. That way, you have something to grab and start peeling the next piece you might need."
4.0,returned it - it was too small and there was no lift in the top.
4.0,Beautiful bracelets! Just wish I could have ordered different sizes. We are a lesbian couple so the men‚Äôs bracelet was a little big. But the bracelets are gorgeous!
4.0,"I love this suit, I bought it for my brother's funeral. It looks wonderful on, but the pant run so small in the hip area. I have wide set hips and these don't stretch like I had hoped, since it did state spandex is used to make them. I'm 5'3 and weigh 150 and got an extra large and the pants were a bit small."
4.0,This is not<br />A listing for a dress as pictured. It‚Äôs for a long sleeve shirt!
4.0,"Nice quality, colors and sized properly for a grown man."
4.0,Perfect fit and delivery was fast
4.0,Am trying to figure out how to add layer under face  mask portion. Fits beautifully. Beautiful fabric but quite thin and gauzy. No protection.
4.0,This is a nice sleak stylish watch for a good price. Well made and my husband liked it.
4.0,3 dimensional and lovely stones.  You will really like this necklace.
4.0,"I like this blouse a lot. It fits fine but I had to order an XL I usually wear Medium.  However, it fits and it looks good."
4.0,"This is the closest you are going to get to a true compression short.  This provides temporary groin support for soccer, hockey, or basketball which I should not be playing until my groin fully heals.  This is similar to the original ones Under Armour used to make.  It is pricey but they last.  After a 2.5-3 years expect a hole to develop in the seam close to the back of your groin.  Unless you get pro-gear, any other shorts are trash or only for style."
4.0,My little sister has had this necklace since Christmas and she loves it. It doesn't look like cheap jewelry at all and it holds together pretty nicely.
4.0,"The fit of the shorts is true to size. Leg length is surf style, not walking shorts. The fabric is really heavyweight, so not as breezy as some similar style shorts."
4.0,"Very nice, recommend!"
4.0,"The neckline is super wide, also note the tie isn't attached onto the romper its separate."
4.0,"I love this coin purse so much. Bought it on impulse when I saw it in line at Giant Eagle (I have the Lunch Money one) and it was way worth my 4 bucks. It's a great fit for putting my rewards cards and change. I only wish the zipper was more firmly attached to the purse part- it feels a bit flimsy. But hey, I'll buy another if it rips."
4.0,"I ordered one size larger than I typically wear. It fit exactly as expected a tiny bit baggy which I like. Wonderful fabric, very soft!"
4.0,My wife likes these a lot and they generally fit pretty well. Sometimes they will be loose if not put on just right but overall they are great for keeping your ears warm when running or any other time you are out in the cold.
4.0,like the non skid. But wish it went further back t o the heel... adorable though
4.0,"These are sooo comfy! I actually don't have pajamas this material and I love the way it feels. Summer is here and that calls for hot nights, these PJs are light weight and breathable. The shorts have a larger slit on the side than I expected but it doesn't bother me, not big enough to show my butt so it's fine (posted pic of side slit)<br />The shirt has adjustable straps which Im glad it has!<br />Overall I enjoy these PJs"
4.0,"I really like this shirt, but it does tend to wrinkle very easily!"
4.0,Fit good. What I expected.
4.0,"Very cute piece. This will work very well in a display I'm working on even though it's a different color, but I can work with it."
4.0,nice to lounge around or where for yoga.  It is a steal for the price.  they are baggy the way they should be so you do not show every crack of your body.  Get it girls. Why be constantly tugging and pulling for modesty.
4.0,"Very cute, but be careful the fabric bled a lot during the first wash. I was worried that white to would stain."
4.0,"It's light, kind of comfortable but, leaves a mark on the nose."
4.0,"Ok quality,  but small.  Send it back."
4.0,"Overall I like this. Good size, manipulates well. I wish the leather was softer."
4.0,"This skirt is quite nice and looks good when worn.  The design and print is nice bright red with white colors flowers and leaves.<br /><br />The fabric doesn't appear to be cotton, it is some kind of synthetic, appears like polyester.  Even with that the fabric is quite comfortable and easy on the skin and doesn't cause any itching or irritation<br /><br />The design of the skirt is quite nice with folds and flair on the bottom edge. The bottom edge is shaped differently - the length of the skirt is variable, shorter from the front and longer from the backside and therefore it looks quite sweet and cute.<br /><br />The elastic at the top of the skirt is also not too tight neither it is too loose and again doesn't cause any discomfort.<br /><br />There's no inner lining in the skirt and that is absolutely fine as the fabric is not sheer and is completely opaque.  The skirt is also true to size and fits well.<br /><br />Overall, this is good, price wise a little higher as you would find this kind of dress for a little less at B&M stores. But still good enough."
4.0,"I love it, perfect size, exactly like the description"
4.0,"I feel so powerful I am afraid I might break this thing. Good prop, bad quality. 4 stars."
4.0,Daughter will use for Prom...love the material
4.0,"This jacket is very high quality. It did fit very good but for some reason when I put it on, it had a very costume-y look to it. That's my only dislike"
4.0,"Very cute, but the headpiece is not that great of quality. The frilly part slips around a lot and fell off a couple times. But the rest of the outfit is cute and fits well."
4.0,"I really like this 2 piece.  I'm 5' 3"" 180 lbs and a 40 D.  I ordered an x-large. It fit  perfectly.  The top was just the right size.  The only problem that I'm having is trying to determine which end of the skirt goes around my waist........hmmmmmm......and by the way I'm 68 years old"
4.0,Nice product as described. Worth the price
4.0,"Very nice and confortable frames,the only thing is that the grey color is much darker than in the picture,they're almost black"
4.0,I really like the fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 155lbs and it was just as billowy and flowy as I thought it would. I wore it to beer festival and got SO many compliments!! Can be worn casually with leggings too. Otherwise would be cute styled like I have
4.0,"Upon opening the package these leggings looked wayyy to small. However after trying them on the stretched to fit me. They fall just a little above the ankle (which is how I like my leggings) so I‚Äôm happy with the fit. There was a loose string on one of the seams however. Also, the product had fuzz all over it initially, but it can easily be shaken off."
4.0,I love the fabric. It is not thin weak stuff. It looks well made But it clings to my leggings a lot. but the only deal breaker is the pockets. I didn‚Äôt see from the photo but they are distracting. Minus the pockets and I‚Äôll keep the shirt next time around.<br />Please click if this was helpful.
4.0,"I have not worn this dress yet, but it fits great. I love how I look in it."
4.0,"The neck line is a little broader than I would have liked, but it is a nice shirt for the money."
4.0,Very cute and well made but were very wide. I could tell when I took them out of the box they were much too wide without even trying them on my toddler and my toddlers feet look fat and wide to me. Had to return. Really wanted them to fit.
4.0,"So far, so good.... Easy to read, like that the day of the week shows along with the date; also like that it's water resistant.  Did not give it a 5 star since it looks huge on my son's wrist. He has a small wrist, but the watch itself fits fine."
4.0,Work hat
4.0,"We didn't realize what type of fabric it was; it's not the stretchy clingy stuff, it's more like a Halloween costume."
4.0,Loved the pants when I 1st got them but after 1st wash in cold water they shrunk in the length. Won‚Äôt wear them outside of the house now due to length
4.0,Cute lightweight jacket with a soft lining
4.0,The wrap was Okk I like that it's stretch a lot and kinda comfort when you put on but the only thing I didn't like about it was that it kept rolling up every time you sat down or you bent down.
4.0,"Item delivered on time, was as described."
4.0,Been wearing it every day<br />Love it<br />Beautiful
4.0,"I like that it's a ribbon that I can tie. It'll fit any head size. I did have to continuously fix the headband. After tying and re-tying and asking a bunch of different people to help me tie. I gave up wearing it. I wore it to the Roaring 20s lawn party, wore it for a good 2-3 hours before I gave up on it."
4.0,"This cover seems to be well-made and well-planned out. I would recommend it to anybody looking for a cover that includes your credit card, money or license."
4.0,Nice fit. Stretches well so movement is never impeded.
4.0,"they are a little narrow, but really cute"
4.0,"I have only two minor complaints: 1) The ankle strap seems a little flimsy, and I fear it will break the first time I wear them; and 2) The heel is a little loose-fitting, so I am grateful for what ankle strap is provided. The toe strap is perfect, and they are very comfortable despite their height. The cork wedge offers firm cushioning, which makes them very easy to walk in. Hopefully the ankle strap holds up to the test. Beautiful summer shoes nonetheless."
4.0,Got these for my niece and she loves them. She's 11 and was super excited to get them for her birthday.
4.0,Warm but a little on the big side.
4.0,Durable and comfortable. But one pair is smaller than the rest.?
4.0,Glasses were good quality and  the cost was good. Very happy with them.
4.0,Really cute and simple.. the chain link is really short but other than that it is really cute I loved them
4.0,"Extremely lightweight, comes with a case, a very handy keychain-sized glasses repair tool (mini screw), and anti-dust wipe for lenses. A lot of bang for your buck! I am very happy that I decided to go with these compared to many alternatives available on Amazon. I got a 5% coupon redeemed, and the deal was a great steal! I would recommend these to men and women. They are very versatile. I bought these after having pretty severe eye dryness/irritation/redness and sensitivity to light after a year of being back in the world where my work/job is run by computers and screens all day. I have tried all medicated and homeopathic eye drops but they have not had any noticeable or lasting positive benefits. I tried these out after finding out that it might be a possible solution through online research. I'm just on my computer writing this review now and watching some TV, and I'm finding that my eyes feel a lot more relaxed than they have in a while. The true test will be after consistently using them at work and home during screen hours for about a week or two. But I can't wait to keep reaping on the instant positive thoughts I already have about them with just an hour of use!"
4.0,"Really cute, but way too small length wise. I'm tall 5'9&#34; and it didn't even come up over my chest. Had to return."
4.0,Not for kids. Too big for my 12 year old daughter
4.0,It's nice but it's easier came out
4.0,Dress is pretty much as shown but the right pocket does not lay completely flat and it does sometimes look odd when I turn to the side. Other than that I do like the dress it is definitely a retro look with the collar/neckline but I love it
4.0,This top has a snug fit. It looks great with jeans or leggings.
4.0,Just received it today and it seems sturdy but hard to close.
4.0,"A little small, but it is a nice product"
4.0,"In the pic there are armpit straps and hand straps. Ours has only the hand straps, so it is wayyyyyy to big for even a five year old."
4.0,excellent product. Well made. Just a little to wide.
4.0,bought as a gift my friend loved them
4.0,"Was kinda on the short side but I‚Äôm also pretty tall and have a long torso. But cute, would have kept it if it was a bit longer."
4.0,Good buy for the price. It is soft and pretty. It will look good with dress up as well as jeans.
4.0,Much smaller than i thought it would be especially for the price. My mom loved it for her birthday though so thats all that matters.
4.0,"It's a good pair of sturdy boots. I also have not seen anyone else wear these boots besides Meghan Markle. I kind of wish I would have just gotten me a pair of Timberlands instead. However, these are nicely made and fit well. They are slightly bigger but I wore thick socks when I was in Iceland so that helped a bit. I probably should have just ordered a smaller size because it did rub my feet after awhile and it did hurt a little bit but I definitely broke them in when I hiked a glacier for a couple of hours. It's definitely not a bad pair of boots!"
4.0,Nice look g but you can t ell it's not going to be a long last watch. I'll let you know how long it lasts but my husband loves it and I plan in getting some kind of spray on varnish to protect it. We really love the way it looks and he gets compliments on it when he does wear it. It's adjustable and comes with the tools to adjust.
4.0,"This dress is very cute.  Runs a bit small.  Fabric is very sheer, need a full slip.  I have sewn in hooks and eyes at the waist, stops the 'gap'.  Looks great with wide belt and boots.  Ordering a hat for the full 'look'.  Like the style a lot."
4.0,I was super excited to receive these heart earrings however while opening them one broke so I could only wear one of them. They are small and simple perfect for those who want simple everyday earrings.
4.0,Gets the job done at a low price.
4.0,I bought this for Work and it makes my job easier because it has pockets. I get compliments on the purple every day. The only thing I wish it had was the strap on the shoulders to hold walkie talkies (radios). I might just make that on the vest.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter as winter boots. They are very warm and seem to stay dry. They haven't been in proper snow yet.
4.0,"This is my first time using a headband for a hike, i usually wear a hat. My hat size for reference is 7 1/4. This head band never felt tight on my head.<br />Whenever ! hike Kokohead trail here in Hawaii i usually wear a hat. My hat gets soaked and sweat drips down and even onto the inside of my sunglasses. This time with the headband i had zero sweat in my eyes and on my sunglasses. Great buy."
4.0,They look super pretty but they were not comfortable for me to wear to work all day. My 10 year old daughter loves them and they fit her and she would wear them to run a marathon so it all worked out.
4.0,Love- just slightly too big for my face
4.0,It defently does what it says it does. By the end of the day I was sweating a lot. I would say that if your needing something to lose inches off your waist this will defently work.
4.0,Fits very well and it confortable
4.0,"I purchased a black polka dot dress in a medium.<br /><br />Shipping: the dress came fast.<br /><br />Packaging: it came in a plastic zip top bag of their company. Wrapped/folded very nicely with a tag that reminded us of posting a review.<br /><br />Product: the material was soft and light and not too thin, just perfect. I do think the seam should be in the back of the dress instead of the front, however, I believe that to have that nice high low design of the dress it can only be done by having a seam. So, the front is higher/shorter than the back, like an upside V shape. I like the style and I love the pickets too!<br /><br />Size: I usually wear a medium/large, I‚Äôm a size 10. It‚Äôs loose fitting so I bought the medium size. The front is a bit low and can show cleavage (which I barely have) even when I put it all the way up.<br /><br />Recommend: yes, absolutely! In fact, I saw my cousin wear it and then I got it a week later!"
4.0,"They run a little small, but they are good quality and didnt slip."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for! A thick, waterproof jacket. I have yet to be able to really try it out in the rain - Portland's been getting an unusual amount of snow this year so I'm wearing a full winter jacket instead, but so far it's kept me warm on sunny 40 degree days when I've worn it.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 150 pounds and carry most of the weight in my hips and I'm glad I got the large size. Enough room in the arms to wear multiple layers underneath, but snug on my hips. Only problem I have with it is the elastic tie around the waste came slightly damaged. Still usable, I adjusted it once to fit and then plan on never touching it again in case it fully breaks."
4.0,Super cute but very thin. For us it means you have to wear underwear with it which isn't always the most comfortable. A thin cotton lining around the private area would take care of that making a much better product.
4.0,The coach brand is top quality. I thought I was purchasing a much larger tote than what was delivered. Decided to keep it nonetheless
4.0,"This wallet looks big, but it barely fits a dollar when its laid out flat. If you have more then a single bill, you have to fold them in half to get them to fit. On the plus side, it has plenty of card holder pockets. This won't fit a checkbook in it at all (in case you use checks). It is cute and well made- probably best for a teen or a child."
4.0,"I bought the ‚Äútribal multi plus‚Äù color (blue and tan patterns) and they‚Äôre super cute! They fit me as pictured. They are a little thin (probably won‚Äôt last more than 5 washes tbh), but my underwear aren‚Äôt visible through them. I like them because they work with many different colored tops and shoes! And they‚Äôre super comfy!"
4.0,The neck is a little bit bigger
4.0,"Classy and made of beautiful materials, wish it stood up a little better but other than that I love it"
4.0,"Smaller then expected, but does a great job for groceries."
4.0,Theses fit big but really cute and good quality.
4.0,Thin but comfy.  Returned the medium because it felt a bit tight.  Order a size up (maybe 2 sizes) if your looking for it to fit like the model.
4.0,They looked better than expected. A little heavy. I love them but I can only do about 6 hours in them. I need a 8 to 10. I gave them to my daughter. She gets everything & she loves them
4.0,"Cute cardigan. Sleeves were to short for me, but I do have long arms, so it will probably work fine for most."
4.0,After reading other reviews I was sure to order a larger than normal size so the fit is quite nice. I am normally an XL but ordered a 3XL just to be safe. I would suggest to anyone that orders this to order two sizes larger than you normally wear for the best fit. The over fabric has a nice feel but the under fabric ‚Äúskirt‚Äù is a bit scratchy before washing. It does soften a bit after the first wash. I purchased this to wear over legging and it looks great. I will be ordering again in some of the other colors.
4.0,"Comfortable shoes for soccer and school. Not tight, there is enough space for your toes, comfortable, no issues so far.  Fit as expected. They look good, too."
4.0,I wore it to a close family friend funeral
4.0,"The necklace came way sooner than I expected.  I read reviews about jewelry from this company arriving damaged, so I was definitely concerned.  My necklace came in tact and in perfect condition.  I wore it with a vintage dress that I have and it went together perfectly and looked absolutely gorgeous.  The only downside about the necklace is that it is not very flexible.  The sections are held together with metal pieces that don't allow for fluid movement.  When I moved a lot (dancing, etc...), I kept having to readjust the necklace, which was annoying.  Other than that, I loved it.  Very good buy for the money."
4.0,very nice watch.  Unique design.
4.0,this was a gift for a 16 year old. she loved it.
4.0,Theses are really cute!
4.0,Husband said this fit nicely.
4.0,"The watch is awesome, just didn't know it was so big!"
4.0,It fit good. I am a plus size so i was very happy that is fit.
4.0,beautiful dress and fits and looks flattering but the straps are uncomfortable unfortunately
4.0,Loved the rich color and the fabric thickness. Fit as expected.
4.0,It is not the best quality. But if looks nice. We gave this to my mom (my kid did) and she loved it. The size is perfect and the colors look good.
4.0,"This bra is really cute and comfortable, but is a bit small. I still wear it, though, so decided to keep it."
4.0,"Fits as expected, a bit of a looser fit. Has a nice cut. The material is a light weight, almost mesh, which is great for working out, but snags super easy. There is a snag from wearing one time."
4.0,"This bikini is so cute. Fit perfect, material is good the only issue is if your big chested your gonna have nip slips other than that I'm satisfied."
4.0,Looks cheap thin
4.0,"I usually wear XS(0-2),  and small runs too large , in any case I love it."
4.0,"I've been wearing these for about a week now, and I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like them. When I first tried one on, I thought that it was too loose and felt that there was no way that it would stay on while I slept. To my surprise, they do stay on, and the looseness is actually an added benefit because I don't wake up with a ring around my head. Another benefit for me as a guy is that they are kinda styled like a beanie. It doesn't look like a bonnet. I can walk around my house and even answer my door without feeling that I look ridiculous."
4.0,A bit tighter than i thought it would fit but i can get the hooks closed so I'm pretty much satisfied.
4.0,"I purchased the white and the mustard colors.  And I like these swearers so far.  I've tried both on for fit and they fit well and look very nice. I've only worn the mustard one to date, which was cozy and light-weight (like summer cover-wear; perfect over sundresses, camis etc.; anywhere you might need a little light coverage). It has a clean, non-fussy look and feel.  I had hope that it would fall a little longer. But a few of the reviews described the length about right, so I'm hoping that there is no shrinking when I wash them.  However, if all goes well, I will probably purchase a few more of the colors."
4.0,This is a soft shirt with a long hem line in a bright red color. Super comfy. Washes and wears well. The arm holes run small.
4.0,I am surprised this costume fits me pretty good given it was one size fits all. Disappointed it's actually shorts not a dress like I thought. I'm an adult small and I would say this costume is a medium. All in all a great costume I can't wait to wear.
4.0,"The product itself is great, but they run very small."
4.0,"Kinda small, but the pocket is pretty big!"
4.0,"I think this is a cute girly dress. I like the pattern and the colors and it has a nice design but I don't think the cut does anything to enhance my figure. There's no zipper, but I had no problem putting it on since the top (in the front only) stretches. The off the shoulder sleeves are held on by just a couple of stiches to the top part of the dress. It seems to run a little small, I normally take a size small, but I received a size medium and after washing this dress (it probably shrunk a little), it actually fit me. The length works for me as well and that's not always the case since I'm five feet tall. This is a nice summer dress for a casual evening out or to wear to a casual party."
4.0,First time on they were VERY tight around the calf but otherwise comfortable.<br /><br />I use them to stop the swelling from my venous insufficiency.  Wear daily especially if I sit a lot.
4.0,Nice color and nice and fluffy! A  hair long for me but I'm a bit on the shorter side. Highly recommend for Peanuts fans!
4.0,These bracelets are a great value for the price. They seem to be pretty well made and came in nice colors. I returned them because my husband didn't like the string closure which I was unaware of at the time I purchased them.
4.0,"This is a great, simple watch. The best thing about it is that it just works and there is nothing fancy about it.<br /><br />What I also love about it is that the style is timeless. I can wear this watch to work or casually and it works.<br /><br />I first bought this watch 3 years ago and most if it held up very well. However, the band which keeps the stray end of the watch flap from flopping around eventually broke. The watch was still in working condition, but the stray end was annoying. Since the watch is so inexpensive, I just bought a new one! For the amount I paid, three years of use is a great bargain.<br /><br />I took one star off because the strap holder broke and because the backlight isn't that strong in the watch."
4.0,Still looks good even though little on small side. I have big boobs so it was snug around chest.
4.0,"Good material, soft and it fits perfect in my two years and half old girl (she is tall like a three years old kid)."
4.0,"It's a Nice, Classy Dress. It fits exactly. I normally wear a 14 in dresses and ordered an XL, if you want a little more room order an XXL."
4.0,Adorable address although around top area very open !
4.0,The color of this dress is beautiful it it runs large I would suggest to get a size smaller.  I'm 5'7 173 and I ordered a xl
4.0,"Nice watch. Keeps time well. Band is adjustable with amicro screw driver, which is great. So far the watch perfoms well and is habdsome on myvwtist. Great classic styling and I love the band."
4.0,Cute dress for the summer!
4.0,"The product itself seems well made and is good value for what you pay. One note though, the glasses are tight. I am an average size male with what I believe to be a normal size head -- I mean, in middle school nobody called me pumpkin head or anything. They are a little too tight for comfort. I ended up giving them to my son."
4.0,Beautiful earrings! The only reason I gave 4 starts is because I have uuber sensitive ears and these made my lobes itch. If your sensitive like I am this may affect you too
4.0,My wife bought these for me as a surprise. To make things short.<br />Amazing. Now love watching the nature channel. Wow
4.0,Ser√≠a mejor q fuera m√°s largo el collar
4.0,Hard to see at night while tricky or treating but decent look.
4.0,The only thing that is disappointing the bottom rides up so you have to pull down often but the material is good and the sizes true
4.0,"I've been eyeing this suit for a while b/c it looks super comfortable and loose and I like the design, but I wasn't too happy about flashing everybody my goods from the side or even the front should a strong gust of wind appear or a big wave come by. But problem solved! By putting a tube or bandeau top underneath it, I was able to successfully prevent unwanted exposure, and it actually looked like part of the suit! I had to do a tremendous amount of searching through Amazon just to find the right bikini top to wear underneath it (can't have straps, can't be tie in the back, not too much coverage around the chest, etc.) and I found 2 that I really liked and go well with the suit: The Sheridyn Swim and the BC Bandeau tube top.  I especially like the Sheridyn Swim b/c it has a clasp in the back and the bandeau is just a tube you slip on and off. But it was fun b/c I got the bikini tops in a bright and fun color to wear underneath this black suit to give it a little pop of color.<br /><br />The suit itself isn't really of great material, it's thin and kinda flimsy, but it's not terrible, and it's very inexpensive, so you can't expect too much from it. It's very comfy and you can adjust the straps that tie around your neck like a halter to either have the V Neck drop down and be loose or tighten the straps to make the V Neck flush against your skin. The smaller set of ties go around the front of the suit around the waist to create a tie or bow (that took me a while to figure out). But I like how the suit is breezy and feels like you're not wearing much, especially on top and even with the bandeau or tube top. It's stylish and sexy and daring. The only drawback, is that in the back, where the briefs come up, the banding is slightly tight (especially for a large) so it create a slight bulge, but not bad. For reference, I'm 5'3, 123 lbs and 36C. I got the large and it fit pretty well, other than the slight lower back fat problem."
4.0,These bar earrings are good but they don't seem like the highest quality. The stud had some defects in the metal but they aren't horrible earrings either. The post not being in the middle is a downside unless that is what you are going for.
4.0,Very comfy. And wife says it's sexy as well. Only shortcoming is the open end is a little bulky and takes a bit wiggle to go through the buckle.
4.0,Good for work - casual
4.0,They arrived on time and as described.  They are a Christmas gift so I cannot attest their durability yet.
4.0,Great for the price. It took a long time to show up but... it is nice.
4.0,Nice hat. A bit short. If it was an inch longer I‚Äôd be happy.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet. Fits well and looks nice. The only con is that over time it will tarnish.
4.0,"I bought the 12-18 month size for my 6 month old when he's big enough, however it fits more like 3T. Luckily I have a son in 3T size, so it works for us, but I didn't need more clothes for him. It is very soft and seems good quality. I love it, just wish it was true to size."
4.0,"Very thin, which is great for the summer. I ordered these in every color for work and the weekends."
4.0,"I really like the look of this dress. The quality is nice and fits more or less as expected. However, the shoulders are a little tight; I can barely lift up my arms. Mine also did not come with a sash, which was disappointing."
4.0,"This bag is as advertised. This is a sturdy handsome well made bag. It's not typically feminine which i like, but for my taste it's a bit too manly.  I used only for one trip so far but i liked it.  I can't attest to the durability since it's new but it seems like it would last.  I could not find a place to hang it from in my timeshare so it sat on the counter.  It's  little clumsy sitting there but it did the job. I would have liked it a bi more flexible - it takes up almost the same amount of room empty as it does full and i didn't quite fill it.  I was a good size for my two week trip but i think it's too big for my more frequent one or two day trips, especially if i fly."
4.0,"These don't fit me properly so I don't really love them.  That aside, they are made well, have a good tint that isn't too dark or too light.  I gave them to my daughter and she is rocking them so they may be better for a younger generation."
4.0,The pouch is a bit high in the cut but it will stretch to comfort. Very nice otherwise
4.0,"The product comes as described - it's a replacement lens for an Oakley Flak Jacket 2 frame.<br />As I was licking through the color options I did not realize the lens selection was also changing depending on what was in stock. I ended up with ""Asian Fit"" lenses for my regular frames. Long story short, the don't fit. (my fault for not paying attention).<br /><br />As far as I can tell the lenses are polarized but they are not as sharp/clear or heavily polarized as my Oakley originals. They are 1/4 of the price but they are not a 1:1 replacement. Make sure you order the right size! 4 stars"
4.0,"Came pretty fast. They are beautiful and look just like the photo. Just as all saddle flared plugs, they can slip out if you play with them too much. Good buy."
4.0,"The sizing is off. Bought a medium cos it said a medium fits US 10. I am a size 8... 34, 30, 42"". It was snug. I can get away with it if I lose 5lbs which I plan on so I will keep it cos it's cute"
4.0,I told my sister I liked how it fit from the front. But didn't like how it looked from behind. She thought I was joking and fishing for a compliment . I would give it a three. But giving how my sister says what's on her mind if it looked bad she would say . So I give it a four star.
4.0,"This is my second boot dryer of the same type. I like that it is compact. I travel to ski. So having a small, compact device is important. It folds up nicely and fits inside my helmet when I pack it. It‚Äôs also very quiet. If you‚Äôre running it at night, you can have it in the same room as you‚Äôre sleeping and it won‚Äôt bother you. My boots are always dry when I put them on in the morning. My only concern is how long it lasts. This is my second device. I believe my last one worked for five years. Wish it had lasted longer."
4.0,I really like this comfy shirt. I would like it alot more if it wasnt all pilled  up already. I've only had it 2 months.
4.0,Nice little watch. Low price.
4.0,"I really like the style, but the only problem like others have said is the placement of the pockets.  Since the fabric is a bit on the stiff side, I think using a different maybe softer/thinner fabric would've made the pockets not bulge awkwardly.  Regardless of the pockets, I got compliments on how cute the dress is.  I wore black leggings as well."
4.0,Cute for my daughter's gymnastics class
4.0,It's amazing! I love this it fits perfectly and is extremely cute!
4.0,Love it! Glad I went a size up and even then fits well but was hoping for growing room! Did not come with with white apron as shown in pic but still great
4.0,"I quite adore everything about this necklace. From the details of the strings to the coloring of the stone. The only issue I have discovered with it is the adjustable knot is not very reliable in terms of security. Mine fell apart within a few days of wear. It unraveled enough for me to double knot the ends a few times, but I'm afraid it won't hold for long. After it completely falls apart, I guess my only option is to double knot the actual ends of the necklace. I guess it's a good thing the stone has a good weight to it because if/when it does fall off while I'm wearing it, I'll notice. I couldn't care less for the adjustable part, just thought they could figure out using a more secure way of keeping the necklace together. It did come very nicely packaged, ready for gift giving if that's what your doing."
4.0,"This band was incredibly comfortable and is easily comparable to the oem Samsung band. The color is initially a strong back, but quickly fades and loses its luster and gains a lint, dusty look. The material is a bit lighter and is more flexible making it more comfortable. Also, the holes seems to line up more with actual sizing. The Samsung band was too loose or too tight. The band does latch on securely as it should, so no issues there. I still like it better than Samsung, but with hopes that the band material or color issue will be fixed in a newer model."
4.0,Functional & durable for shower or pool.
4.0,"These earrings are cool looking, and because of the material, (plastic?), they are very lightweight and don't pull your ears down and that's always a plus.<br /><br />So far, I've only worn them twice and have received compliments both times. I'm not sure about the durability though, since they seem kind of flimsy? I haven't had any problems so far, and if I do, I will come back and update this review. For now, I like these a lot!"
4.0,Fabric could be a little more durable
4.0,Very comfy .
4.0,Purchased for my sister.  Works exactly as it should.  The butterfly is very tiny though (as is expected!)
4.0,My daughter is a 34DD and wears a 4/6 in street clothes. I ordered her the large. It fits her perfectly and she loves how comfortable it it.
4.0,The dress fits true to size. Its a cute design with the perfect length. It loses 1 star for me because I strongly dislike the stretchy fabric material. I thought it would be more stiff and heavy with a bit of stretch. Also the zipper tends to get stuck near the waist line likely due to the material.
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful earrings, although a big larger than I expected. Still, they are gorgeous."
4.0,It's a really nice top. But bust ran a bit small
4.0,"This zippered pullover is lightweight & attractive pattern, however I found it not true to size.  Ordered XL which should have been fine but fit was very tight. If you want a more relaxed fit, I suggest ordering your next size up."
4.0,I really love this bag!! It's cute and fits everything I need.
4.0,"If you're tall, know that this will err on the short side. I'm 5'9&#34; and this was too short for work and (in my opinion) too short to be comfortable to wear out in public for fear of a tiny bit  of wind blowing it up. But otherwise, I did like it."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt like that it was to big but it is a cute and comfortable dress
4.0,"Used pendant, band too small for me"
4.0,Loved the boots. Recieved many compliments and they are very comfortable.
4.0,Product is nice and what I was looking for. It is a little smaller then I thought it would be.
4.0,This pack of glasses are great for those who only need glasses periodically. Also like having a couple pair so can leave them at my different desks and not having to carry them around.  I am concerned about the hinge as to how long they will last but for now they work well
4.0,It's cozy.  My only complaint is the zipper isn't as good as it should be.
4.0,"Perfect thickness for July, but it's cute enough that I'll wear it in the fall too."
4.0,Easy to pull on and store.
4.0,The only flaw is that it is just a tiny bit too big. It will move on the steering wheel but not drastically.
4.0,"Works even without a petticoat! I have yet to wear it, as it needs some ironing, but am looking forward to wearing it this weekend."
4.0,I ordered an XL to give me some room and I'm glad I did because this cardigan is fitted.  I love the look...<br />So if you wanted it to be slightly fitted order 1 size up.  If you want it loose order 2 sizes up.
4.0,"They are nice. A tad small for my head & I wish the straps were a bit wider, but they arrived as advertised & the quality is good. I‚Äôd wear these more as a fashion statement than for waving."
4.0,"The product photos for this tail are so poor, you can hardly tell what it looks like. Here is a detailed description of what to expect. The tail is big. Very life size to tohru. It will show very well under her long dress and it will drag on the ground. It attaches via a long white string that ties well around the waist. The tail has 3 separate discreet zippers. One on the top, middle, and bottom. The zippers lead to 3 different aluminum balloons that you inflate. The product comes with an inflation pumping device. It‚Äôs flimsy but does it‚Äôs job. Inflating the balloons inside is simple. Deflating it takes a very long time. The balloons do not fill the 2 ends of the tail. So your tail will be be very floppy at the 2 tips. The sewing on the tail is a bit weak. Upon inflating for the first time, the seams began to rip apart, exposing the aluminum balloon. It‚Äôs an easy fix but disappointing it happened. Overall it‚Äôs a good product despite its flaws and of the more life size ones out there available for purchase. I am satisfied."
4.0,I only commented on the medallion because the chain broke in the first week.  I forgot it was still on and took my shirt off and snapped the chain clean in two.  The medallion is good quality.  I've worn it everyday for months and is has not faded or rubbed off.
4.0,these are great i baught a few of them and the colors are realy nice
4.0,Fun to wear in however many ways you can come up with to wear it! Can be causal or add a little flair for some style
4.0,"I used the size chart to decide what size to get... I measured my waist at 42 inches.  XL is said to fit 41 inches and XXL is said to fit 45 inches... I ordered a XXL and it just barely fits. Ladies order up a size or two! But the belt is super nice and I would highly recommend! I only gave 4 stars cause sizing is so off, the quality is 5 stars though."
4.0,This shoe really hurts my instep. I've had other Nike in the past and this has not been an issue.
4.0,Comfortable and flowy.
4.0,"This is an adorable bathing suit the only problem is make sure you read the sizes. I ordered the 4X for my grand daughter who wears a 14 and it was still a little small. It is a nice quality made suit . I was given this at a reduced price for a review, just order it in a size larger than you need. It really is an adorable bathing suit :)"
4.0,"I'm a tall guy (6'4"") with larger than average palms (9"" circumference around mid-palm) but fairly slim arms, so I was concerned about these not fitting.  A lot of these ""arm warmers"" are targeted at girls/women and are usually in the 2""-3"" range for width flat, unstretched.  I've tried athletic arm sleeves but they are made to fit super snug like tights and I can't seem to find anything that fits my big palms AND my average arms.  So I figured a sweater type material might be more forgiving than the spandex found in performance athletic fabrics.<br /><br />These surprisingly fit the bill!  They are very soft and comfortable sweater material that has a TON of stretch to it.  The downside is that they don't rebound fully after wearing, so after a few days they are starting to feel looser than I'd like.  I'll see if a trip through the washer and dryer on low heat will restore the snugness and report back.<br /><br />The other negative is that the thumb hole is sized for women... very small women... so I had to spend an hour with a sewing kit bringing the hole about 0.75"" lower down the sleeve and making the hole about 0.5"" larger.  More work probably than most people are willing to do for a simple inexpensive thing like this, but since my hands/arms have a weird proportion, I'm willing to do some modification to make it work."
4.0,"Nice and comfortable, I would have given 5 stars if the neck was bigger. Neck is too short and thick and would have been better if little loose open. Colors and print are just as picture and looks lovely"
4.0,"Nice pant, stood the many squats test, but kinda on the small end. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 about 145 and curvy, the med/large was very snug. Otherwise nice pants for the price!"
4.0,I needed a tight fit and this works very well.
4.0,"Way too small. I'm always between a small and medium, so I size up if there's a doubt. The medium was so tight! I'm so disappointed. The dress is really cute and to exchange and size up was twice as much."
4.0,These sweats are comfy and have pockets. They are slightly big but I love them.
4.0,"This is a nice hat as far as party hats go. The felt design is sturdy. It seems a little large, but fits my head well. I knocked a star because the decor seems a little cheap, and the hat looks more like a green pilgrim hat than a leprechaun hat to me for some reason. Overall, a fun addition to any St. Patrick's Day celebrations. You should also check out these: [[ASIN:B01BEOWLSY OliaDesign¬Æ St. Patricks Day LED Flashing Glasses - 1 Pair]]. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Good belt. Wider than I expected but okay
4.0,Cute dress but it is a bit long.. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù got a medium and if the belt was not there I would be walking on it.
4.0,"Very stylish and unusual.  Fit is very small though, no room for a bulky sweater or jacket."
4.0,they fit as expected and very comfortable.
4.0,"I love this organizer. Before this, all of my wires, dongles, etc were a disorganized mess in my laptop bag. No longer!  Now I just slide this out, and remove the item I need. Simple concept, well executed!"
4.0,I thought Mr. Potato Head was a game that I had played as a child. This was fun as a Colts fan but it is not a game as there were no directions.  The grandkids will like just playing with it.  it was quite late getting here in comparison to another that I had ordered.  It came during our family Christmas celebration.
4.0,Came on time - fits well and nice and soft.  Only complaint is how dark the gray is on the shirt makes it very hard to read the bl7e writing.  Hope the shirt fades a bit with more washings
4.0,Good deal for the money overall very happy with them
4.0,Material is hot polyester. Fit is accurate.
4.0,"This &#34;chemo beanie&#34; was a nice surprise.  It is a nice warm and soft fabric, so very comfy.  Runs a bit roomy, but not a problem due to the relaxed style.  Like the basic, neutral color.  I wore this a LOT during my chemo months."
4.0,"This fits perfectly. I am 5'9&#34; and 140 lbs and I got a small. I knocked it down a star because it is a bit see through and doesn't fall as smoothly as it does in the picture. The back is a v-neck and the front is a scoop. Other than that, it's a cute, bright color and I am pleased :)"
4.0,Could have a bit more compression.
4.0,But nice looking and a good fit
4.0,Beautiful watch. shame that the battery died 2 days after he had it.
4.0,"very pretty, just smaller tan expected"
4.0,"I ordered these on 11/19/13 and they just arrived today (1/22/14) so they're taking longer to receive than the estimate.  With that said, they are nice and for $4 including shipping, I really can't complain.  The leopard print one is large and could be used a shawl over your shoulders.  The zebra print is a &#34;regular&#34; scarf size.  I admit I had forgotten about these so it was a nice surprise in the mailbox on this snowy day in the Northeast!"
4.0,Pretty thin and cheaply made but expected with products from Southeast Asia
4.0,They fit around my legs fine but are a little short so if you bend too much they pop up from your boots.
4.0,Loved the robe! They didn‚Äôt send me a pipe though ..
4.0,"I was very surprised that these were a little loose on me!<br />I'm normally a 14, on a non bloated day, and these were slipping off my bum.  I purchased them in a large.<br />Like they state, they are SUPER SOFT and feel like pj's.  I was super pleasantly surprised that the advertising was correct!!<br /><br />I also got them in a medium to see If it would fix the issue of size, and it MOSTLY did, but then they were too short.  I'm 5'9.<br />Large - 5'9, 190 - too loose, but the length was perfect.<br />Medium - comfortable BUT too short.<br /><br />INCREDIBLY sad that I had to return them.  If I was like half an inch shorter the medium would fit.<br />I will DEFINITELY be trying another style when I can!!!!<br />Give them a shot!!!!"
4.0,"I bought this wallet for my son in the Army.  It is slim and not bulky but has a lot of room in it.  It has two bill pockets, one clear plastic license pocket and a few credit card pockets. The color is beautiful and appears to be very durable. I am a bit disappointed that it didn't have the extra tri-fold flap.  It was shipped in a nice gift box.<br /><br />I received this item at a reduced cost for my unbiased opinion.  I test every item I receive."
4.0,Is well made and looks expensive the only downside is that the fit is large and the sleeves are unusually long.
4.0,"I love it,just wish it was darker. Received the dress very quickly.I am 5''4 190 and I brought the large and it fit great. Actually impressed."
4.0,"Bought it for my brother for Christmas, the sound quality is obviously not incredible, but it is a neat concept."
4.0,"I like them. not an expensive ( a little cheap made) watch but good for banging around work. I am happy, did not pay alot."
4.0,Jacket fits nice
4.0,"This shirt is exactly like the picture. There are not loop holes for the belt which makes it easy to adjust the tie where you want it. However, it was a little large. I am usually a solid small-5'3"" and 125 with a small bust and I could've gone down to an XS. Overall I really enjoy this top for work or a night out."
4.0,Cute. My only problem is that the diamond is a bit fake looking other than that they are good.
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture but it took some getting used to the high waisted bottoms. Very cute suit. Fabric seemed a little cheaper than expected.
4.0,"Good fit, work well. A little bit of sun creeps in over the top."
4.0,"To start, I was contacted by a rep from this company to get this gi and review.  I have been practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for eight years and have tried my fair share of gis.<br /><br />First, the gi itself is nice and light weight. Def a good summer gi.<br /><br />Second, I have worn and washed a few times and it has not shrunk.<br /><br />Third, I would recommend this gi as a great practice gi.  For the price and use, definitely worth the purchase."
4.0,These are the lightest weight glasses I have ever found!  Comfy and really protects my eyes from the sun!
4.0,"Great deal. Little to snug for me, but I‚Äôm accepting it.  I would order a large if I could do this again. I am only 110lbs"
4.0,"Besides having to order a size up, its great. Great price, great metal, looks well made. Its honestly just what i wanted. I a<br />Still have to return my first order cause it was too small."
4.0,Nice and warm. Super stretchy! Love these and want to buy more!!
4.0,Adorable. Daughter loves it. The top fits great but bottoms were long.  We rolled them up.
4.0,"Comfy, beautify dress; received multiple compliments on it. Ropes snag easily and pull off, dress is fine without them as they serve a decorative purpose only. Large busted women - the buttons do pull across the bosom. I pinned mine and they are fine, no one notices."
4.0,the quality is so-so!I'm not thrilled.
4.0,"It's a nice looking good quality belt for the price. Much larger than expected though, I ordered a small and the total length of the belt was over 42&#34; with the smallest you could make it being 34&#34;."
4.0,I went a size up in the pink. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 120 and had to get a medium. So I got a medium in pink and gave the size small black to my lil cuzin who is bout 5‚Äô5 and lil skinner. Gets lots of compliments on them. And thin and comfy. And don‚Äôt think that<br />Cuz it‚Äôs black u gonna b extra hot because u won‚Äôt. The material is thin and can‚Äôt sweat with it on honestly
4.0,"Very nice picture and material quality,  only thing is... bought it as a gift and went by the measurements,  but it really is a bit small."
4.0,I really liked the shirt!! Quality was excellent!  I always where xl. It was to small. I need xxl
4.0,It was a nice outfit but me having big boobs it was kindda small in the breast area...I wear large and have 36DD breast
4.0,"I really like these, they give a fluorescent effect to them. They‚Äôre not opaque as I thought but they‚Äôre still pretty. The only flaw I have about these is that they‚Äôre thinner than you‚Äôre usual plug. They fell out of my ear whenever I slept with them or moved my hair behind my ear. Overall, they‚Äôre nice"
4.0,grate present
4.0,I loved the sturdiness of the material. It's hard finding a plus size bathing suit that fits D cups well. I even loved the bottoms which is super rare for me. Ran a little large
4.0,i disliked it was not leather inside the shoe as you walked.  my other pair had the leather inside the sole  loved them and so comfortable  these would be perfect if they were the same
4.0,"It does not come with a ring to attach to collar; otherwise, it came exactly as we expected."
4.0,"The setting for this necklace is a bit on the ""cheap"" side, but the price is reasonable.  Never-the-less, the quality of the CZ is wonderful and the bling works it.  Not disappointing and goes with a work ensemble, as well as a casual one.  Loved it! :)"
4.0,IT IS GOOD BUT  ! I DID NOT GET A FREE PROTECTION CASE...I WILL BUY AGAIN IF THERE IS A PROTECTION  CASE WITH THE GOGGLE
4.0,"These were suppose to be black with some grey but they were black and white. A lot of white, way more than the picture looked. They are breathable and comfortable. Only con was the color."
4.0,"Cool, but about the size of a quarter. Theyre stuck on the batting material in my cubicle at work üëç"
4.0,Easy to use! Love the way it feels when having sex!
4.0,"These are exactly what I ordered.  They snap on good and they are nice and shiny.  However, I still can't find the .925 stamp on them, but they are supposed to be real, sterling silver.  They look nice and they fit perfectly."
4.0,"Giving this a 4 star and not 5 bc it‚Äôs not super soft and the stitching on it is just ok. There are a few places on my sweater where you can tell the stitching in the seam isn‚Äôt consistent. The good news is it‚Äôs not anywhere or severe enough where it‚Äôs noticeable to anyone else but me.<br />I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again only bc I like a softer sweater, but I will enjoy it and wear it. It is cute and a great price. I am 5‚Äô2 & 180 lbs and I bought an XL and it is nice and baggy."
4.0,I LOVE this dress!!! It is very pretty and it fits true to size. The only draw back I had is that it needs to be dry cleaned.
4.0,Love this dress and got a ton of compliments on it. The quality of the fabric dye isn't great but you can only tell when stretched. Fits true to size but it's pretty long and has to be hemmed. Would definitely buy this again!
4.0,This skirt fits below the knee so if you are 5'3 and below be cautious unless you dont mind the maxi skirt look. The color is vibrant however the material feels like nylon? Silk? am not sure but I won't advice ironing this skirt unless you know the right temperature to use.  It has 2 side pockets and a partial elastic waist band so this will fit almost everyone especially if you are plus size.
4.0,Very soft comfy shirt. Exactly as advertised. The only complaint I would have is the bottom is a little flared out and boxy. But intend to tuck it in anyways.
4.0,Really like this dress! Easy to dress it up or dress it down. The color is a little more bright red than the picture. Still love it! Im 5‚Äô4 145lb 34D I got a medium
4.0,Great summer vacation dress
4.0,"I really like this little bag. Sometimes you don't want to carry your whole purse with you and you just want to take the minimum with you. This is perfect for that. You can fit your phone (possibly but if not perhaps you have other things you can fit in the phone spot to take with you? Though that may defeat the purpose just a bit). This is the perfect bag for the cross body design. It's nice and light and you can keep it close to you at all times.<br />The drawback to this is that there is quite the gap where your cards would go. Even though the card holder slots are very tight, the bag has that gap so that is something to consider. Otherwise it's very nice and super cute."
4.0,Nice summer dress with pockets! I have a large cup size so I purchased an XL but the 'tank' portion of the dress is stretchy so I could have purchased a large. The dress stops right below my knee.
4.0,"I would recommend getting 2 sizes larger than you need...I got my son 1 size larger and it just fits. That aside, he feels like the coolest dude in town wearing it and overall we like it (just wish it fit better so he could wear it longer; once the cold is over he'll not be able to wear it again :-(  )"
4.0,"My first experience purchasing a necklace here went well and I liked the product so I‚Äôve ordered another. Great price, thanks!"
4.0,"Surprisingly love it! I have a long torso and large butt which is a recipe for disaster with one pieces, but this works. Wish there was slightly more butt coverage but it's doable"
4.0,I only got the necklace
4.0,"It's beautiful. Great material. Have some problems with delivery, they sent the wrong one at first and the second delivery took 2 weeks. When finally came I tried on it was too big even though was Small so I had to make some changes on the size of the dress ( by hand üòú) turn out perfect!! I'm 5'4&#34; tall and 100 p in case your wondering if that would fit you"
4.0,Still looks good almost a year later. Love my necklace. I wear I several times a week! Lovely. It has turned little though but not too bad.
4.0,"Nice quality material, decent bag!"
4.0,"We used these to put on my foot when I had a broken ankle before I put my boot on each day. They kept my foot warm but were  lightweight. My husband was able to get them onto my ankle and foot without hurting me because we bought the XXL. For anyone who has foot surgery or a broken ankle or foot in the winter, these are great when a regular sock is hard to get on."
4.0,Wife said they were good and comfortable but don‚Äôt offer much support. Straps are a little thin too but good for the price.
4.0,This is being held for Christmas for my son. It looks nice at this moment.
4.0,"A beautiful,  sparkly bracelet!  But the color is not in the pink family, it is more of a copper color."
4.0,It's beautiful but pretty pointy. Doesn't feel good to sleep in this or have it hooked on your clothes when you change. But I LOVE butterflies so I like it very much. Just wish there were more colors.
4.0,"I store a lot of gear in these and it really helps to organize my stuff. The zippers for the mesh pockets are cheap, but hey, it's 20 bucks!"
4.0,"Amazon 2-Day Shipping!!!!!  Love it..........  Item arrived lightning fast as usual.  Items appears to be made of a quality material, no lose ends.  I'm using it with my '84 Seiko Dive Watch.  22mm lugs.  Looks and fits great.  My only issue and I guess it's my fault.  I must have very large wrists.  This band is 288mm in length and I am on the second to last hole.  Barely enough strap to make it through the first ring.  Hoping it will or might stretch out some.  A little tight.  Other than that, its a quality item for the price."
4.0,Love the watch but seems like it was used not new as described. Band has marks from where it was worn before. Not returning because the price was so good.
4.0,"I bought it as a gift, she said it fit perfect. She's about 5'0 and I purchased a medium."
4.0,The leather is decent quality and the key rings are sturdy and easily removable if you don't need all 6. I have a key fob with key that doesn't close into the fob but was still able to make it work by removing 3 of the key rings and attaching it to the extra hook.
4.0,"I do like them its just that the hoops look a bit awkward if put on nose since the hoop is pretty thick, but I liked it as a septum. It also pinches my nose, I wouldn't recommend if you have a low tolerance for pain. Besides that, they look good anywhere else you decide to place them."
4.0,"Love the overall comfort and stretch of this bra. It fits true to size and smooths the back too. The fabric is smooth, cool and comfortable. However, there are pads to cover your nipples that aren‚Äôt attached. They are between the inner and outer layer of fabric and move‚Ä¶a lot. You can adjust them but it takes a few minutes to get them where they need to be placed and even close to the same on each side without being bunched up. If those pads would stay put this would be a definite 5 star from me."
4.0,Very good thank you üòä
4.0,"Full cut,  nice woven fabric 2pair for under 19.00. wash up nice and soft.<br />Purchased second set."
4.0,This is pretty.  It wouldn't stand much activity but pretty while it lasts.
4.0,"Fits as expressed, the white is a little see through though, so you definitely have to wear something underneath that you can see!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a decent clip but it‚Äôs pretty hard to get your tie and shirt in it. It‚Äôs really tight, which I guess is something you‚Äôd want, but boy this sucker will fight you when you try to put it on. Once it‚Äôs on though you‚Äôre good to go. You definitely won‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off that‚Äôs for sure. If you have the money, it suggest getting a tie clip instead of a tie bar, but if you don‚Äôt care all that much or don‚Äôt have the money then this is a cheap solution. The gold tone looks good, it‚Äôs sturdy, and cheap. Other than the tightness it‚Äôs a solid little bar."
4.0,"Fits as expected.  I purchased it in hopes that it was designed for extra small chested gals, but it fits the way any bra of this size would fit me -- a little bit roomy!  If you're basically flat chested (and just fine with that!), this might not be the bra for you.  Stick with the children's section."
4.0,Love the jeans!  I ordered 12 in error by putting size in quantity.  I requested a return authorization the day I received the order and as of today I have not received authorization.  I really need to return and receive a refund.
4.0,Quedo perfecto y lo no me agrado fue que cobraron del banco dos veces la misma cantidad he hice una sola compra
4.0,Adorable bracelet...
4.0,A little tight for me and I have a pin head.  Just passed them on to the kids and they liked them a lot!
4.0,I love these lace tanks. I wear them under most of my shirts. I ordered a size large. I wish I had ordered an XL because they run tight in the hips. I would order these again but just go up a size.
4.0,Very nice and great for jewelry and Christmas ornaments.
4.0,Nice shirt but I I have to put a pin between two buttons to keep from exposing my bussom. Otherwise good fit
4.0,It will be ok for my needs
4.0,"Just a little long around the neck for my 5 yr old, but he loves it!"
4.0,It's a very cute top for the price. If you are in between sizes I would suggest that you size up.
4.0,I mean it‚Äôs great for a quick costume
4.0,"these are very comfortable. The fabric is heavy and warm. Love the fit. I have full hips and short legs. They are a little long, but that is ok, I like em longer to go over my feet. nice deep pockets to keep stuff inside pocket when you sit down."
4.0,"the quality is good, I would like it to be a little longer and the initial does not move from the center since I must be moving it to center the initial"
4.0,"I got this to use in my pocket instead of a bulky wallet. Ordered several for friends. All the designs were not the same and these were a little stiffer to open and close than others I have purchased in the past, but they are very satisfactory."
4.0,"I was  expecting a yellow face like the earins, but is a gold color, to me the size is to small, but is üëå. My girl is so happy, and that was my tool.<br /><br />Thank you"
4.0,It kind of dug into my skin a bit but otherwise it was perfect.
4.0,Nice and light spring/raincoat.
4.0,Wet suit material
4.0,"It does its job. I only bought it for Halloween, I was scared it wouldn't fit based on the other comments, but it fit perfectly, it was super comfortable."
4.0,"I like and use all of them... except the large, two hole starfish... it‚Äôs kind of weird looking."
4.0,Beautiful necklace..<br />Great gift ..<br />Well made for the price..<br />However I did not receive the black bag that was suppose to be with the order..!
4.0,"Was way too large and not nearly as dark as I had hoped, more a dark pink than a crimson red"
4.0,Fits pretty good
4.0,"For people who collect roses , great gift nice colors !!!"
4.0,Fits well üëçüèº
4.0,"So far, I like it a lot, but I haven't tried to wash it yet. I bought it as a shirt for when I need to look nice this summer, and it fits  the bill. (I have a very casual lifestyle and job. lol) I am 5'10&#34;, about 180 lbs. and I wear a 36G bra, so I'm always concerned about enough room on the chest, and enough length. The XL fits perfectly on the chest, and does not look too baggy elsewhere. And it is long enough to comfortably wear with dress slacks. It is a little tight in the arms compared to the rest of it, but okay on me -- if you have heavier arms, avoid it."
4.0,It is a cheaper quality and very thin fleece. But I purchased it to make a grinch costume.  Please don‚Äôt look at the green fur I added to it.  It is perfect for what I wanted.
4.0,I ordered light pink. Cute product. Very thin material and okay for the price
4.0,I read reviews saying these jeans were long . They are regularly length.
4.0,I only got the pink pairs not the white ones  :(
4.0,Fashionable look for a business look
4.0,"I've been looking for black racetrack tanks that aren't so low cut under the arms and back, these are perfect and so very stretchy. They aren't compression but they are just what I was looking for. I plan to buy more in the future!! I don't wear them alone because they are a bit sheer (thats why its a 4 star not 5 star) but they are perfect to wear under my colorful but bigger tanks."
4.0,chain isn't the best &#34;fake&#34; quality but the charm is cute and unique.  I just put it on another one of my chains.
4.0,My sister in law LOVED this
4.0,Very nice and high quality. Didn't give it five stars because I ordered the wrong size so I sent it back for a replacement a month ago and I am still waiting.
4.0,The ring looks exactly like the picture. I got one for myself and for my daughter. Mine turned my finger green but when I placed my review I was promptly offered a replacement product or a full refund. They were very helpful and attentive. If you get this product I recommend going with a necklace or bracelet. Very pretty.
4.0,Like the skirt.  Fit as expected.
4.0,"I really liked the texture, it looks like Realistic skin! The shading and tone on the abdominal and nipple area are fantastic! Also, it has realistic muscles in the back area which look just right. It's perfect for cosplayers and for doing goofy stuff. Still, the size isn't accurate , the L size is Too Big. and the material looks wobbly, It fits better on women with C-D bra size. or chubby men.<br /> But if you're average size, it will fold like on the second pic. That will reduces realism.<br /><br />I recommend buying the S size if you are small, thin or don't have a big bra sizing."
4.0,"Great costume hat very authentic looking, look forward to Halloween gathering!!"
4.0,"It's too long for my 5'5 frame, but I just the cut the bottom with scissors and I'm good to go. This dress is very flattering."
4.0,"I could‚Äôve gone down a size, but I‚Äôm satisfied. Not really for the itty bitty titty committee members, but you can make alterations."
4.0,"A little under mid thigh, otherwise great"
4.0,Sunday best!
4.0,"I recieved this item after a long day. Instead of wearing it to the gym, I wore it during the 2nd activity where I sweat the most - cleaning house before a major holiday. After all, who will rouse you into a working frenzy but the most critical group alive - your own family.<br />Putting the shirt on I thought, its soft but maybe a bit snug. I don't know about this. Let me say for the record, I hate to sweat. This is why my favorite thing to do is swim, which I only earn after cardio. This shirt wicked the sweat away from me and kept me comfortable. I cleaned so long it triggered a hot flash from Hades. This shirt kept me comfortable through it. The length was good and stayed in place. I looked cute while cleaning!<br />If you are looking for a cute performance shirt, and remember what it is made for, this shirt is for you!! I do recommend if you are chesty or curvy like I am to order a size larger than you normally wear. This shirt is great for the gym! I cant wait to wear it skiing. It will keep you warm, yet wick away that gross sweat. Order it, it's a steal!"
4.0,I loved these pants when they arrived & they fit perfectly. After I washed them they shrunk & are now too short.
4.0,"Love the dress, just wish it had belt loops to hold the belt on the dress. It was perfect for our sunset cruise in Maui"
4.0,Pretty and simple. I have had it a few months and it has NOT changed color or anything. Great buy for the price.
4.0,Great product.  Same as picture shown.
4.0,Very cute bracelet my daughter loves it
4.0,My son used these for Halloween to be a gangster vampire! They arrived on time and looked great. The top row sometimes did not fit so well but that may have been user error ;-)
4.0,Worth the price for my costume and looks nice!  shipping was good.
4.0,"Very cute nighty!  It does run a bit big, but my daughter can just wear it longer this way.  The material softens up as you wash.  My daughter loves it."
4.0,"For the price, they are exactly what i expected, a cheap headband that you can wash a few times and then toss when they get sweat stained and gross."
4.0,"The print is beautiful and is a replica of a Gucci print. The material is very thin but not see through. I used the dress for a . Frida Kahlo costume and it was a hit. The arms are tight, so unless you‚Äôre nimble I‚Äôd be careful when ordering sizes. It fit me like a glove and the stitching around the waist would give any one a nice shape. Size up."
4.0,Really cute but totally clingy and material is super thin. It shows a bit more than I'm wanting to show.
4.0,"These have been my favorite compression socks for awhile now, probably close to a year. I ordered this pair in the same size as two other pair I bought in stores. This pair from Amazon aren't as comfortable as the Go2Socks I've purchased in stores. They fit higher up in the leg (bend of the knee) that make them uncomfortable. That is the only reason I have these socks 4 stars. As far as the comfort from the compression, they're great. If give them 5 stars if they fit the same as my in-store purchases."
4.0,"i was disappointed to see it was smaller than expected, but with a thinner belt it looks fantastic! always gets second glances and compliments, an overall good buy:)"
4.0,"I bought this for my husband because he can‚Äôt wear anything on his wrist at work, the watch fits loose it doesn‚Äôt stay on the frame, so we just clipped on the band instead, its seems more secure, the band material feels soft, they should sell the band by itself at a cheaper price."
4.0,"Stitches gave way at bottom of pencil pocket; should have two utility pockets. Otherwise, quite good heavy material."
4.0,"I love this anorak hoodie, but I'm sending it back because it fits me really well in the hip/bum area, but waaaaaay too big in the waist and too big in the chest area. It wouldn't be worth the cost to have it tailored (as I do with many of my clothes)."
4.0,I should have gotten a smaller size. I really like it though. Nice quality.
4.0,The band was a replacement for a watch I have had a couple years. Delivery was quick and the quality seems good.
4.0,Fit as expected. Cute shirt for a reasonable price.
4.0,very pretty and clarity is good.
4.0,Great dress for the pool or beach. This material is thin but perfect for hot summer days. Pockets are shallow so not great for long-term carrying of large items like wallet or phone but ok for lip balm. Decent product for the price.
4.0,"Not like the old, all cotton sweatshirts, but as good as it gets and I shall reorder soon."
4.0,So comfy and cute! I love this style. Use the sizing chart to get an accurate fit.
4.0,Wish they were warmer. But not bad. Like the Velcro so baby doesn't get them off!
4.0,Great quality.  It is bigger than I expected and the hook is rather heavy.  Overall it's a nice keyring
4.0,Mine didn't have the point ontop was ok
4.0,Good product.  Only complaint is that when I opened it from the mail it had leaked all over.
4.0,"The logo and image are great, but it fits my husband really tight"
4.0,Lenses fit perfectly into my Oakley breadbox sunglasses. They look great as well.
4.0,Peferct for home coming.
4.0,"The style is nice, but they were way too small. Like youth ages 2-5 small."
4.0,"I can't knock it for being small since the description has the dimensions, but I did have to give it to my wife since it won't fit on my belt loops. The keyring did get some scratches just putting her keys on it though."
4.0,I would buy more like this
4.0,"The fabric of this shirt is very comfortable, and the style is nice and not constricting.  The quality of the garment itself is not great.  I would not wear this shirt out of the house."
4.0,"These are very attractive; I get lots of compliments when I wear them.  I bought these, because I got a wonderful free mask from my CBD company that was stitched with the same pattern. I found the material on the free masks to be thicker than these, so these didn't perform the same.  These masks sucked onto my face when I breathed in.  I was totally bummed.  Then, I got the idea to cut up a piece of clear plastic in the shape of a filter and place it in the filter pocket (I only wear these for outings where I'm not near people - I wear a KN95 when I'm at the store or face to face with others).  I cut apart a thin plastic folder - the kind that bends, punched holes in it to let sound through but not too many so that it would still hold the structure. The masks are now perfect, well structured, and feel great.  I remove the plastic piece when I wash them and reuse the next time I wear the mask. I simply won't pay to buy a supply of replacement filters for a cloth mask - that's silly. If you want filtration - go buy KN95 masks."
4.0,"I love this little purse, it has lots of pockets and lots of space and a front flap that holds my tablet!<br /><br />The only negative so I found it all is that the inside area is rather small even when you expand it, and the velcro needs to be reglued down."
4.0,"Okay, so we should all know by now that this is going to run small. Just order up, follow the size chart, but when in doubt order one size up. This dress is tight and pretty darn sexy. You will look curvy and if you've got pantylines the next town over will see them, but that's sorta the point too right? This is not the dress for ladies luncheon or modesty but seize the day! Buy a push up bra and get out there and break some hearts!"
4.0,"I typically wear a size 12-14 - I ordered a size large in this dress. It fits perfectly! It falls just below the knee. The color is vibrant, and it seems well made. My only complaint is that the zipper consistently gets stuck in the same spot. It takes a significant amount of effort to get it to zip even though the fit is perfect and there is plenty of room. My husband said ""this should be easy to zip, but it's just not."" I took off one start because of the faulty zipper. Overall, I love this dress. It will be great to wear for an upcoming wedding!"
4.0,Gave as gift to granddotter. No complaints so far!
4.0,"Very warm and coz. Very little room for stretching, so my be outgrown very quickly"
4.0,Bar is shorter the I planned but they work
4.0,Lovely dress! Sadly was too small in the waist and too large in the bust and am having to return. Definitely built for true hourglass shapes.
4.0,"Good quality and design for low cost jacket. Note: it is too light, is not fot cold weather, its only fashion."
4.0,"Pros: Cheap, very soft<br />Cons: cheap, no two pairs are the same."
4.0,"I know it says a dress, but fantastic pajamas, though a bit short."
4.0,I love the product itself! The texture is nice and I‚Äôm so happy it wasn‚Äôt 100% polyester. The only problem is that the XXL fits like a medium. So this product may not be for everyone but get at least a size two or one up.
4.0,It smelled kind of chemically when it arrived. But it's as cute as in the picture and works well for me so far.
4.0,Love the soft material of these capri's.
4.0,Fits great...the colors are a bit LOUDER than I thought...I think it looks like my Gramma's curtains...I posted on Instagrams...got laughs AND compliments :)
4.0,Cute earrings not as sparkly as pictured
4.0,These bars fit better than I had anticipated. The colors are slightly darker than pictured. They are adjustable and soft. They feel supportive for me.
4.0,I usually wear a medium and bought a large because I'm wearing it as a PJ shirt. Good thing I did as it runs small. Very soft!
4.0,11 yr old Daughter gave to her mother 50 birthday
4.0,Watch is nice and very well priced.
4.0,The goggles are what I expected. I‚Äôm still having trouble keeping water out of the goggle about 50% of the time. It might just be me
4.0,"I bought it for one of my children friend's birthday, always he wanted to have a mask from that team.  It was a big nicely surprise.  I am happy.  Great seller."
4.0,These pants are comfortable. Material is a little thinner than I like my yoga pants to be and they run a little short in length. If they were longer and a bit thicker i would give it a 5
4.0,"It is well made, spacious with lots of compartments but very soft.  Unfortunately, it is a bit too slouchy for me.  I can never find anything in it."
4.0,Super cute but was not long enough in my torso to wear.
4.0,"The fabric is soft, but be aware it will show any imperfections, like my love handles.  It also runs small."
4.0,"Live the dress, looks great. Wish the material was thicker."
4.0,I like them. They appear to be very good quality for the price. I probably would give them a 5 if they were available in a shape other than round.
4.0,"They look pretty good. The fit is good and they are polarized too. Not as strong as I thought there were going to be, but for the price, they are good. I recommend them."
4.0,The hat was a nice quality. Everything else was fine except for the inflatable cane. I choose this set vs cheaper sets for the cane but it was huge for my 6 yr old as it came up to his shoulders.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 117lbs. Most of it fit perfect except the gloves. I do have pretty thin arms and wrists so I might just hem it or super glue it and make it tighter haha.
4.0,"I do like the earrings but I do wish the stones were better matched.  The metal is a little cheap looking in finish, but overall not too bad."
4.0,Arms just had a lot of fabric. Comfortable dress but the fit wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for
4.0,Cool design and good quality. Genuine leather. I liked it.
4.0,"Sturdy, attractive laces. Very thick, so they were a little difficult to thread but I feel like they will last well."
4.0,"Cute, can't wait to wear it this fall."
4.0,Like it but somewhat small. . . Unless I just have a large head.  Not very slouchy but still happy with it.
4.0,I loved it but my wrist was a bit too small so it‚Äôs a bit loose but no biggie. Great quality!
4.0,"These leggings are very comfortable, soft, and thick.  They are plenty wide to fit plus sizes nicely.  They do not slide off my waist and stay put after wearing all day.  My only complaint is that they are too long for me and I have to roll them up at the bottom which I think looks kinda weird.  I'm 5'4&#34; so I don't expect the length to be perfect, but these are longer than most leggings I have tried.  They will be great if you are really tall and need that extra length."
4.0,Great fit and very warm.  Great price.
4.0,"It fit fine and the material was okay. I'm smaller-chested, so I found the proportions to be pretty good. I did end up returning the dress because I wanted serving more flowy, and the way the material draped was too stiff and not as flattering as I had hoped."
4.0,They fit perfect and had them for a few weeks and they still held up.
4.0,"The top of the dress gaped too much at the sides.  We have to take it in by darting it due to the cut of the dress. Otherwise, very cute and perfect for homecoming."
4.0,Good.<br />But after later fluff come out
4.0,"little lose, no other complaints"
4.0,I got them early and I get lots of compliments. They're the right size just smaller than what I thought they'd be.
4.0,"so beautiful but didn't fit as expected size 16 5""4 and i ordered and XL based on the size chart but it was probably 1 size too small"
4.0,"Russell sweats are well made, but the arms are baggy."
4.0,"I usually wear an XS but a S in swim. However, this suit had a cup size best fit for a large B or C in a small suit. Fits cute, great quality, but sadly the chest is just way too large for me."
4.0,Very pretty! Great color (a true Rose Gold) but the smaller than I thought they would be (I got the 7mm) Still a good buy!
4.0,Ran a little small. Great for our vacation and our putt putt golf outings
4.0,"Bottoms are cheeky, fit true to size, I ordered a small and wear a small in panties form VS or la senza and a size 4. Top fits but the band under the bust is odd and a bit loose. Feel like It would lift if I jumped into water"
4.0,These cufflinks were a great hit for my husband and the ball in each cufflink actually rolls around which is super cute. Arrived on-time and with an actual cufflink jewelry box which was a definite plus!
4.0,I like how it feels.
4.0,Black color faded way to fast. Only got to wear the cap for about 3 months and it was no longer black.
4.0,"This would be a 5 star review but it loses a star because of the tacky,plastic ,silver, cheap looking buttons.  But when life gives you lemons... cut off those ugly buttons and rock that cute sweater! The material is soft and comfortable.  Worth the buy if you can do a little DIY"
4.0,"Overall a cute and comfy dress but doesn‚Äôt quite fit like pictures on model so I‚Äôve included some of my own photos. The length is perfect for me, but I am 5‚Äô2 and could see this being too short on anyone much taller. The straps are a little wide for my liking, so I wore a t-shirt over today and loved that look. The one thing I didn‚Äôt care for is a weird inner lining over the chest area that hits me mid-boob- not sure if it‚Äôs function. It‚Äôs definitely a good versatile dress that is the perfect length and material for summer!<br />My size: 4/6, 34B and ordered size M<br />**If you found this review helpful, please mark as helpful!"
4.0,"I'm an apple shape, so the flair of the skirt was a little different on me than the mannequin in the picture shows. It's not cupcake floofy, like I was afraid of, but it wasn't flat either. It was a happy medium.<br /><br />Once I lose this spare tire around my middle, it will look more like the picture, and I can't wait!"
4.0,"Super cute. Not cheap at all. But not as pink as the picture shows, in my opinion."
4.0,"My Sense cane with a plastic band that required the end to be looped under. I t made proper fit difficult and offered problems when taking watch on and off.<br />This is a breathable band that adjusts like a nirmal watchband  The only issue is the ""one size"".  The tail wraps almost all the way back to tge watch face, and the keeper slides away from the end. Overall, I am very satisfied. It is much better than the original. I have used it for about a month with good results."
4.0,"I bought three of these because there was a promotion and I could get three for $14.99. I got the clear, blue, and black. They are all very pretty, but only the clear is actually 3mm. The others are 2.mm. Still okay with me. The posts are a smidge long and the curve a little tight, but with jewelry pliers it was nothing to bend them a bit so they were easier to get in and fit more snugly. Overall, I'm happy with them, particularly for the price, and I have had no trouble with reactions to the metal."
4.0,"BUT the item is not as pictured at all, and I despise false advertisement. The balls are not balls, but rather flat discs. Still, the outfit is oober cute! This is a 5 star outfit minus that little mishap. It fit my 11 lb poodle/bishon perfectly and he's a chunky monkey. It also fit my 9 lb, 12 inch tall miniature poodle and he's very thin. Therefore, that goes to show this costume is very diverse and the dimensions are proportionate enough to fit any average sized animal. The hat is also an AWESOME thing - LOVE it. It fits around the ears, not over them, so it's securely attached to your doggy's little head. Definitely would recommend this to any dog owner. If you're on the fence about what size to get between large and medium, go with the Medium because there was some extra room with both of my pups."
4.0,Very cuter set but wouldst work for my teen niece. Better suited for an elementary student.
4.0,Great product. Took forever to arrive
4.0,I love this skirt I wore it to my bridal shower.. it runs a little big.. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and it was floor length on me and I wore it high waist..
4.0,"I was nervous ordering these because there were no reviews, and the price seemed too cheap compared to all other listings. Against my better judgement i ordered them, because i have a tiny budget and a 4-year old birthday girl who loves unicorns. Well, they arrived yesterday, and completely proved me wrong. Seems really sturdy, and the stretchy headband was a perfect size for my (almost) 4 year old. They looked so cute (looks just like the pic), and my daughter loved them and didn't want to take it after after she tested it out for me.<br /><br />Update- ordered another pack, and although they still looked cute, some of them came off the headband due to being glued on badly. Easy fix as I just got the needle and thread out to attach them better, and the kids still love them. Still worth the price, but i took one star off for this."
4.0,The dress is lovely. I ordered a 2x and it fits perfectly. Dose need a petticoat.plan on wearing it to Walt Disney world. The fabric is 95% Cotton and 5% of a stretchy fabric. It arrived folded in a nice plastic bag. There were wrinkles but a warm iron took care of them.  The length is great. Was worried that it may be Short but it falls just below the knee.  A great dress. There are washing instructions.
4.0,Pretty summer dress for the price .  The loops that hold the belts are not put on very nicely and are too visible in my opinion but I still like the dress . Nice inexpensive summer dress.  Also when the wind blows watch out your underwear might Show when the slit blows open but it‚Äôs nice.
4.0,"Very pretty colors.  The necklace seems a bit longer than shown on the mannequin, and the magnetic clasp securely locks when you line up the little pins.  I like it!  I don't plan on wearing the earrings."
4.0,"Very good &#34;Fitover&#34; sunglasses.  I have &#34;transitions&#34;, so I don't need sunglasses, except for the car.  These work fine and look ok.  I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 simply because they are tinted but not polarized.  If they were polarized, then the would block some additional light under certain circumstances (such as light reflected off pavement or puddles).  In the future, I'll look for polarized sunglasses."
4.0,"This automatic mechanical watch has sapphire glass on front AND back PLUS a high-beat movement inside! For $60 it was a no brainer for my collection. This model is identical to model AM0276, just with rose gold case and a bracelet.  I put a leather strap on it to match the rose gold and its 1000x better.<br /><br />It gets 4 stars because the case back is stamped with another model # and the bracelet was not a good match.  Hoping this watch lasts many years at this value but I'll be happy with 2."
4.0,"It's very soft, the fabric feels great and drapes loosely on me so it feels like a great summer-lounging tank top. The arm holes are enormous though, either everyone is going to see my bra or will see my boob fall right out the arm hole. Absolutely serious, I wear an H-cup and my stuff EASILY falls right out of the arm hole if I lay on my side. So, I won't be wearing this in public unless it's over a swimsuit or something. I'll wear it for lounging around the house, it's soft & comfy and my husband is not going to mind the peepshow on each side."
4.0,A bit small; go one size up to fit your other fingers
4.0,"Great travel bag, fits it all. Durable and packs up to store conveniently."
4.0,"I buy these and love them--this color, however had some either scratches or tiny fissuers in the rock that you can see from about a foot away and closer. At a distance--no biggie."
4.0,Gift for my wife
4.0,The jeans are REALLY cute unfortunately they run way too small.  I am normally a 16-18 so I order the XXL and they came up to my hips and would not go any further.  They are stretch material and they did not seem cheaply made.  The design was really nice I really would have loved to have these jeans.
4.0,"I would say I'm normally a Med-Large in dresses and tops. I ordered an XL and the fit was just fine. It's form fitting which I expected but still looked great on. It is a bit short, comes above knee but it made a great tunic so I was happy. For the price, I can't complain!"
4.0,We use for pottery
4.0,"Really cute and a good buy. Its a bit longer and thicker than expected, but i would buy again."
4.0,Top is small so just size up and cut the tag out.  ; )
4.0,"PROS:  Cute<br />  Simple Design<br />  Perfect for organization<br /><br />CONS: Wish the bow attached to the ring was a bit larger, since it looks a little small to be the first bow you see."
4.0,the fit is nice.  the back is much lower then the front.  its shorter than the picture shows
4.0,Good buy...
4.0,"We measured our son‚Äôs foot and ordered up a whole size and the shoe is still too small. He was so excited to have his new shoes, I didn‚Äôt worry about checking size since we had ordered up and now we have a worn shoe that is already too small to wear and can‚Äôt be returned."
4.0,I love this scarf. I just wish it was a little thicker.
4.0,"This is a nice quality bag.  The emblem is tilted only very slightly off center.  The description states &#34;Interior center divider zip closure pocket,&#34; but that is not there.  It has one exterior zip pocket; a zipper across the top of the bag; a zip pocket in the back of the inside, and two pockets in the front of the inside.  Other than that, the inside is completely open.  No center divider at all.  That's a big essential for me.  A big part of why I chose this bag."
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered accordingly but it was a little too big, my daughter doesnt care and we will keep it. She can grow into it."
4.0,I like the fit and design. I usually wear small but I ordered medium and it fit more comfortably. I took one star off as there were many loose threads on the sash/ belt. I find the fabric to be a bit stiff but I guess this is what also helps keep the structure of the skirt and keeps it fuller looking. I think the price is reasonable for what you are getting.
4.0,"The design and fit are very pretty. I had a little trouble figuring out how to wrap and tie (even though I have 2 other dresses from this company, similar style with sleeves), but this one seemed to wrap differently for some reason, I would have appreciated a diagram or something, but eventually got it. This dress is very comfortable. I've only worn it once but I would image it would be great to pack for a trip as well."
4.0,"This is a nice looking wide band that fits well and is easy to change in and out.  I like the softness of the leather and the stitching (tan) near the tops of the band.  One word of caution--at least when I ordered it, the green band (which shows black) and the black band (which shows green) when toggled are reversed.  I ordered green based on the selection (which was black in the picture) and received a black band.  I like the band, but quite a bit, but there is a glitch on the order link."
4.0,"I love this hoodie! It fit perfectly to size, so if you're a medium and want it bigger, order a large. However it's not much of a hoodie. It's very thin so it's a nice throw over in the summer or spring. However if it's winter I don't recommend relying on this to keep you warm."
4.0,Nice comfortable work shoes
4.0,I like it but it is a bit thin
4.0,"So far so good. Ive been using this wallet for a while and it feels great in my back pocket. It's a little bit wide in order to accommodate foreign currency but its plenty thin. My only gripes are that it's a little tough to remove the drivers lisence and it has been leaving a little bit of glue residue on my cards, but that is easily rubbed off. The yellow/blue color looks pretty good in person."
4.0,"I had to take the smallest size available but even that was a little too big. Love it's material and design except it looks big on me and is a little too wide at the legs it feels like I'm wearing something way oversized. Still, it's a good product."
4.0,"I like the colors and material. Not as baggy as I would've liked. But it's a nice fit. I think it could be worn all seasons with boots, heels, sandals or even a nice color sneaker/ boat shoe,."
4.0,I absolutely love this cap because it comes with the satin lining inside so it protects my hair. Also love that it can fit over my hair as well I have a lot of hair & it‚Äôs essential that it is covered.
4.0,I like it but didn't check the size before ordering. I would have preferred a larger size but I will not return it because it was my error.
4.0,So far I like them if you really want to know better answer give me two more weeks and I might be a better rating because I haven't had a chance to wear them
4.0,Material is super soft but hard to tell of it will keep me warm yet. Colors are beautiful! I'd give 5 stars if the material had been a little more substantial. But it's very pretty.
4.0,it fit really good and comfortable I like the quality
4.0,My grandson put them on his pants but I had to fix them because they would come lose or break
4.0,"Very comfortable! I use them everyday for work. However, they may be too soft and I find myself wanting more support. I still use them everyday but feel the need to switch to more supportive shoes every few days or so."
4.0,"I purchased this wig for my Mardi gras costume and it arrived on time and looked just like the picture. It was easy for me to brush out (using wig products and brushes of course) and style. I wear my bangs on the left, but the wig came with them on the right, thankfully it was very easy to change sides without there being a bald spot, unlike some I've had before. It held up very well through the parades and didn't tangle up with the beads too bad.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the wig seemed a little thin, I had to style it just right so you couldn't see the netting. Once I got every strand In the right spot I set it with LOTS of spray. Oh, and the bangs are crazy long, it's good if you feel comfortable cutting your wigs, but for me I just bobby pinned them to the side.<br /><br />All in all its what I expected for the price.<br />Not a wig for every day use but great for special occasions or dress up."
4.0,beau tissus<br />belle coupe<br />bien pour l automne<br />Mikelina
4.0,"Great Belt! Have used it for about 10 months now and it is holding up well. I even bought some as presents for other people. Great thing is that you can take off the buckle, and cut the belt to length, which I found by accident."
4.0,"I bought this dress for a '50s bridal shower and it was exactly as I expected.  Bright colors and plenty of fabric to make a voluminous skirt, as I wanted.  The material is thin cotton, but certainly not bad quality.  I only wore it once and have not washed it yet, so don't know how it will hold up after the wash.  I think it's a good buy for the price."
4.0,The underskirt barely covered my butt! I had to wear another slip to make sure I didn‚Äôt flash anyone
4.0,The piece is as it was described but when it arrived the display box was broken. I will try and repair it as I don't want to have to send it back and wait for another.
4.0,"Great quality for the price, vibrant colors! Got lots of compliments."
4.0,"The material is very nice. A bit thin and see through but overall nice and soft. However the color is not a true burgundy it's more of a Violet purple. I'm 5'9 and the dress is about an inch above my knees. Normally I am a size 4 but had to get a size 6 because the 4 was tight above the chest area. I am a 34C, 25/26in waist. There is no stretch so make sure you know you size exactly or size up for a comfortable fit instead of a tight fit."
4.0,This is a great shoe.
4.0,Product was pretty cute for price. The hem was uneven but tulling just needed to be trimmed up. I returned it because it turned out to be not as flattering on me as I had hoped but it was a fun skirt.
4.0,"Well-made product and very durable.  Comfortable to wear all day (if you get to do that).<br />Only very slight drawback is the back of the heel.  Due to the design making an inward slope, it makes the shoe somewhat difficult to get on.  You can't just slide your foot into them like other Ugg house shoes.  Perhaps they did that so they wouldn't fall off very easily.<br />Small price to pay for how well made they are and how good they wear."
4.0,"The quality is okay, about what I'd expect for the price. It fits as expected. I don't know if I'd recommend based on personal preference, I don't really like how the dress fits, but not on personal preference I would recommend."
4.0,The battery did not last me too long and the paint came up from the top watch. sorry but I don't think this is a good product. but other than that the service was fast.
4.0,Decent little tie. Served it's purpose and was pretty well made. A few loose strands but overall a good tie.
4.0,I returned the suit because it was too big.  I did like it.
4.0,The material is not of the best. It's spandex and thin. I would have been willing to pay a higher price for cotton. However... I love the way it looks on me. I'm usually a size 12 US and I had to get a 2x.
4.0,"Very nice quality<br />Chain is short, so perfect for a dainty look"
4.0,It‚Äôs really soft and fits good but a little bigger than I would like. Love the pockets
4.0,I really like the cross front sweater. I ordered the blue. The quality is great. It has a denim blue look. I first ordered the tan/camel but sent it back because the color was not as expected. I am overall happy with it
4.0,Not as expected but kinda like it
4.0,It was good. Nothing to rave about but the clothes fit and my son liked using it.
4.0,Helped a little bit.
4.0,"This dress was purchased for my daughter's prom. I had to send it back a couple of times because the size was just not right. Either the dress fit perfectly, but the bodice was too snug or her girls were spilling out of the top of the dress. I finally got a size that could work, although it was super long. I have to say that this is a very beautiful dress. The dress sparkles in the light, which made all of her pictures look fantastic. I am glad that prom is over, but what do I do with this dress now? With her permission I will upload a photo or two."
4.0,The person I got the ring for really likes it.
4.0,Great shoe and hoping it will last
4.0,love them but wish they were a little smaller
4.0,I was very surprise and love it. Only down side it is way to big I have very small wrists. Trying to see if I can have made smaller or will have to return.
4.0,"Enjoy these  boots for their comfort and style.  Lining is warm and great for walking the dog!  They fit a half a size big, but with a pair of socks pulled up over the jeans, the look is just what I am looking for.  So yes, I am happy and satisfied with these round a bout nepal boot."
4.0,Fit well. Material a little thin. Good lounge wear.  The yellow and black is nice.
4.0,"Been wearing them since they got to my mailbox and they are what I expected. I was told that they would keep my feet dry and do they ever. I don't have smelly feet, but they do sweat, no more with these babies."
4.0,Feels great on lips. Put it on once and never think about it again also not rdy feeling just press lips together.
4.0,Great material but top half of dress to small
4.0,A little to tight across the bust but otherwise fits nicely.
4.0,I bought these before and will buy them again.  No show protection for your feet and for your footwear.
4.0,"Dress so pretty, elegant. I love the material as well not cheap. Size are too small though so make sure when u order u know your size very well."
4.0,"Initial fit was just right. After wash it was a bit snug but acceptable. Appears to be well made, durable and perfect as an outer or underwear garment . . .  bgs."
4.0,"Cute and fits as expected. There is NO support or compression but it makes for a great sleep bra on hot nights and also as extra coverage for low cut shirts. Light, thin, comfy, and elastic band was not tight. Very light fit."
4.0,"I bought this headdress to complete my last minute scarlet witch cosplay for megacon. I got lots of compliments about it! I was nervous about it, it was actually the most expensive piece of my entire ensemble. I showed a photo of how the straps attach to the tiara, which basically seems like a duck tape sticker. But held up fine, even during a stage combat class! I also showed a picture of the piece that tightens the straps. I was afraid it would be very visible as when you make it tighter it bulges, but I hid it under my hair and nobody could see it! The only bad thing is that it kept sliding. Shown in the last two photos, how it slips up my head. But simple re-adjust to just pull it back down on my forehead and it looks great again. Last picture to show outside lighting<br /><br />EDIT: after this review, I wore it one more time. It was my stored safely and displayed, not touched otherwise. I take great care of my items, especially cosplay ones. When I went to wear this for the third time, just sitting in my car and it broke! Amazon ended up helping me resolve the issues, hence change to 4 stars not 3. It probably would have been easily fixable, but that‚Äôs besides the point, you shouldn‚Äôt have to fix it anyways"
4.0,I have a black phone so it doesn't show up as well as if it was a white or light color phone.
4.0,Not bad but too tight for my legs and leaves allot of indentation marks will try another size up .
4.0,"The fabric is not what I expected, but I like it just the same. Its laundered well and I haven't noticed any shrinkage."
4.0,"its overall really cute, but the straps are a bit large..."
4.0,very pleased with the item however I read the reviews of issues of the stones falling out after I purchased it so once it came idid take a extra step and glue the stones in place before putting ashes in it. hopefully that will not be a issue with me.
4.0,Love the fabric and fit of these pants.  They are just like Lululemon pants.
4.0,"A large fits well across the shoulders and hips, but is large through the waist. A medium fits in the waist and hips, but is too small across the shoulders. The curse of the tall."
4.0,Really impressed with these boots for the price.<br /><br />I did buy 1/2 size smaller than normal based on other reviews and they fit perfect.
4.0,"I really like these earrings, although, they aren't actually black but a very dark silver color, more of a grey I would say. They are also very heavy but that is to be expected with how long they are. I am happy with my purchase and the earrings came on time."
4.0,The hat is great cover from the sun. I wish the bad around the hat was adjustable like the ones I ordered for my kids. It can be tricky in the wind.
4.0,"I clearly marked it was a gift and yet it arrived in a  bag, clearly outlining a hat! The good news is the person I sent it to loved it."
4.0,It's a decent looking band. I couldn't give it five stars. Mostly because the clasp obviously won't stand the test of time.
4.0,This was a big hit with my kid. He used it with his Halloween costume (grim reaper looking thing). The one thing I don't like about it is that once you put the base together you can't take it back apart. Maybe you can??? It feels like if I pull any harder I'll break it.  This just means it's more challenging to put away and store for the next use. Since is started in pieces I expected to be able to disassemble it which would be so much more convenient. Other than that issue it's very cool and looks good and scary!
4.0,Seem durable
4.0,"I read a previous review saying it's kids size & got a bigger size (XL) which is a wrong decision.<br />Please note, this is adult size, XL = 23 inches across chest<br /><br />I can't return it coz I'm from Malaysia. I really like the photo but it's a bit big for me :("
4.0,"Nice pair of baggy shorts.  The seams across the thighs make the shorts feel somewhat tight at first wear, but that goes away.  Some post-wash wrinkling around the pockets that isn't too bothersome.  Would/will buy again."
4.0,"I love them, but they are uncomfortable to sleep in (kinda sharp on the prongs)."
4.0,My 3 year old granddaughter loved her teddy bear necklace. It's very cute. The only problem was that I had to glue the bears skirt back on about an hour after I gave the gift to my granddaughter.
4.0,Not a bad little costume but basic. I‚Äôm adding extra trim...little touches to make it nicer. I saw someone else do the same thing in their review. I guess it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. I also added an extra crinoline skirt to make it fuller.  I don‚Äôt mind adding to it. Someone else might. I think it will be just what I wanted when I‚Äôm done.
4.0,"Fabric little thin. Adorable, great fit"
4.0,Cant wait to wear this!  I have a bigger butt and longer torso so its a little snug lengthwise but other than that I love it!
4.0,I like but to small
4.0,"I bought this to wear while I clean because I was tired of my belly being soaked in dish water and cleaners after I clean the kitchen . It definitely does the trick . Has adjustable straps for comfort and fit as well . Blocks out maybe 75 % of liquids , but does soak through a bit"
4.0,"The buckle is as described and fits my Casio G3500 band just fine. The locking bar could stand to be a bit wider, since most bands that are this wide usually have wider holes/slots as well."
4.0,the belt button way too lose otherwise great dress
4.0,"I LOVE PEARLS  BECAUSE THEY ADD A BIT OF CLASS TO BOTH  SWEATERS AND SHIRT/BLOUSES WHICHIi LIKE TO WEAR WITH JEANS.  FORTUNATELY PEARLS CAN NOW BE WORN WITH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND NO LONGER JUST FOR EVENING AND COCKTAIL DRESS...ON THE MINUS SIDE THEY ARE JUST A LITTLE HEAVY AND TEND TO TANGLE  EASILY BUT THAT IS MINOR AND STRANDS CAN BE REMOVED  TO MAKE IT SHORTER OR LIGHTER... BOTTOM LINE,Ii LIKED IT FOR ITS VERSATILITY.. ."
4.0,"Color: Cwbsp075_navy<br />I can't find any pockets in these shorts, which was the main reason I picked these. They're also a bit too tight, but still wearable."
4.0,"I like the pattern, great summer print. The background color is a very light peachy or pink color. The dress arrived very wrinkled in a bag and the washing directions suggest dry cleaning, which is not practical but I am going to try to steam it to get the wrinkles removed before I can wear it. There is no chemical smell to the fabric so I appreciated that. There are &#34;fabric straps&#34; near the spaghetti straps on the dress. The picture shows them tied in the front into a bow but you can also tie it behind your back and it looks ok too.The bottom is longer on the sides than the front or back, a lot of material gathered near the bottom but once all of the wrinkles are removed, I'm hoping it lays a little better. Will update after first wear. Overall, pleased with the dress. I'd probably order a smaller size. I purchased a Large based on size chart. I wear a 10/12 so I went bigger just in case. It fits fine but not as fitted through waist as I'd like. If you're smaller up top(pear shape) like me, go with the smaller size rather larger since there's an elastic back so it'll still fit your lower half just fine."
4.0,"I liked this product very much, they fit perfectly. The only thing wrong with this set was it didn't contain enough hardware for all the straps included. It was enough for three straps the package contained 6 straps. I had to  rivet the other three straps to the skates, but it all worked very well. Otherwise i was really happy with the final results. Would buy again from seller. Thanks again.<br /><br />P.S seller did contact me several times during shipment to see if i had received product great communication from them."
4.0,"This dress was a great value. The one HUGE problem is that we ordered them for bridesmaids dresses and on the day of the wedding, we discovered some had the upper chiffon lining as shown in the product photo (as we had hoped) and some had open lace (where your skin shows through) as seen in some of the customer photos. This was NOT a good discovery on the wedding day. If you order a product, it should be the same product.  That said, the dress says it is machine washable and I found it to be comfortable. It does have a low back where a regular bra may show."
4.0,pleased with my purchase
4.0,The sweater itself is super comfy and the color is as pictured. The only thing is that the ‚Äúknot‚Äù (it‚Äôs not really a knot) looks a little awkward if not situated properly. I would buy again
4.0,I'm typically a size 18 pants and a 36c top. The bottoms fit great! The top however is too big. For the price though I'm thinking about buying a second one a size smaller and then the top will fit. The suit is super cute.
4.0,"The fit is a bit big and loose, but I don't want the next size down (I ordered large), I can wear a sweat band or bandanna or something underneath, not really a big deal.I still like it a lot!"
4.0,"These dresses are cute. The print was bright and vibrant. It is nice that you get two. They looked just like the picture. They were very comfortable for my kids to wear. The only reason I took off a star was I didn't love the material. It was a little unusual. It was light, but I just didn't care for it as much. The kids seemed fine with it. Overall, I would recommend it."
4.0,"A very cute, comfy dress! The skirt was a bit bulkier and longer than expected (I'm 5'3""), but it fits super nicely. And has pockets!"
4.0,I bought this as a present for my mom. She loves it. Was shipped fast. I give 4 stars because I have yet to know how it will hold up to normal wear and tear. Looks nice though!
4.0,"I love this t-shirt's fit and message.  Four stars rather than five because the material is scratchy.  It washes well, however."
4.0,I'm giving it 4 stars because the dress itself it's very cute...but I have to return it because it runs a size smaller. I wear large in dresses and I have to order xxl. I'm buying it again! !!
4.0,"The cut of this garment is good on an hourglass figure and the length is appropriate to height ( a 1-X is about 3 inches off the ground on someone who's 5'10""), it is at least one size too small around the upper arm, across the shoulders, and around the chest. In my case, it's more likely two sizes too small. Otherwise well made."
4.0,Super cute and comfy! Only issue with it is the wire sticks out a bit on the side and digs into you. Might not be a problem if you have bigger boobs.
4.0,"Liked the product, trimming where was supposed to be black was grey"
4.0,Work for my dad very well!
4.0,"It's not really a snapback. It has a curved bill.  I like the hat; but, it was for my son who is very picky about his clothing and accessories.  He will only wear the snapback/flat bill hats right now.  The embroidery on this hat is of excellent quality.  I just wish they didn't advertise this as a snap back. It could've save me a whole lot of time and frustration."
4.0,pretty but its darker than pictured
4.0,Made from really smelly plastic (like a new bike tire) and kind of itchy but good enough for Zoom calls. The smell goes away after the first wash. The fit is true to size. Nice patten. I got it on a really good deal but I would definitely not pay $20. The material is worth less than $5.
4.0,"Looked great but felt like the cost, love the fact that it came in a box although the box could have been smaller"
4.0,"My child usually wears a 3T - but is very skinny and needs elastic waste band on everything.  This 2-4 size fits her perfectly.  It isn't tight on her lengthwise, but I will be surprised if she can still wear it next year."
4.0,Granddaughter is very happy with this hat.
4.0,"I'm a graduate student who has her computer in the living room.  I also have 3 kids.  Enough said?  As much as I love my little minions, they are loud, and it makes it difficult to concentrate with the kids screaming and the TV rattling in the background.  Hence the reason I bought these.  They don't completely drown out the kids, but they muffle the sounds enough that it's reduced to minor background noise.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after about 1-1 1/2 hours of wearing them, they become rather uncomfortable and I have to take them off."
4.0,I like it it was just a little big on me but i just made an extra hole :)
4.0,Great fitting and works well
4.0,"This is the second shirt I bought in this brand and I must say I'm impressed with the quality.  The shirt is well made and the fabric is super soft and breathable.  I also really love the little buttons, which I think adds style to this basic v-neck shirt.  Unfortunately though it runs small.  Since this isn't a very fitted shirt, I took a chance and ordered the XL for my husband, but I should have ordered a size up instead.  My husband's normal size is XL but this was too tight for his comfort.  It's still a really nice shirt with excellent quality, but I recommend ordering a size up.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  However, in no way did the seller influence my opinion about this product.  My opinions are 100% my own and based entirely on my own experience with the product."
4.0,Tight in my toes not really comfortable either after about a hour or so
4.0,Shirt is not as long as it appears in the ad and I have to agree with other reviews that it is more boxy than long but I really liked it and it is a comfortable sweatshirt.
4.0,This for the x squared exactly but I did not get the screwdriver with it.
4.0,My friend like it „ÄÇ
4.0,"I love the key ring, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the keychain holder it comes with but over all really good product"
4.0,"It looks just how it does in the picture! I wish the chain was longer by just another inch so it fit over my head easier, but that's the only thing that I would change about it. It is beautiful! I can't wait to put together an outfit with it!"
4.0,I loved the bangles and the presentation was even great! The red bracelet was the perfect match to red ahoes...
4.0,"These are nearly identical GymShark's version. I'm convinced that they are made by the same manufacturer and GymShark only sticks their name on them...just like every other clothing brand does. Anyways, the sizing was inaccurate -- I'm a medium in gymshark and a Large in these so size up! The large matched up to my gymshark Mediums perfectly --  all of the seams, cut outs, and designs are the same. Great quality and much more reasonably priced -- plus I love the dark blue which gymshark doesn't have!. I wish they had more colors *Hint hint*"
4.0,Very cute necklace but the materials are a little cheap. It's what you would expect when buying a five dollar necklace by I will totally be wearing it every chance I can.
4.0,"Nice fit, good looking, do their job well.  My preferred brand of the moment."
4.0,"I bought this for my nephew who's almost 3 and it is a good fit on him. However, the material is a bit hot for summer, so it will be better for spring or Autumn, when it's a bit cooler."
4.0,"This pad is very cushy and good quality. It fits my 6 mo old perfectly as an insert in the stroller. I originally bought it to go as an Insert in my baby bike seat carrier, however the head area is too cushy and pushes her head forward too much. I was disappointed that the head portion doesn‚Äôt zip off as was advertised in some of the stock photos."
4.0,Bought this strap to wear with the pochette accessoires that came with the multi pochette. I absolutely love this strap!! It looks authentic.
4.0,"Little loose under the arm pits, but this shirt fits as expected otherwise. Good quality. Thin material means the shirt is cool, and perfect for workouts. I wore it with a pink bra today and it worked well- when the shirt shifted under the arms, the pink on pink meant the look was was pretty modest. I‚Äôd buy from this company again."
4.0,"Cute, stylish, well made.  Would definitely buy other colors."
4.0,"Stretches a but with wear, but otherwise perfect! Went back to buy a 2nd one!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress... the material has somewhat of a shine to it which you don't get to see in the picture but it's a pleasant and welcomed surprise. It's not thin, even when stretched it doesn't become see-through.  I'm only returning the dress because it's maybe half a size too small for my liking."
4.0,I thought it was like the regular beanie fabric like sweater material but it‚Äôs more like t-shirt material my daughter will still wear it because the logo but it‚Äôs not her favorite
4.0,"these were definitely over sized, which i like. They are just a little flimsy so i don't expect them to last too long lol"
4.0,This item is good quality the rubber ear pieces are good and strong they don‚Äôt slip off it‚Äôs worth the money glad I bought it
4.0,nice deal for the number of socks you get
4.0,Nice wallet. Only lasted a few months before it started ripping inside
4.0,It fit like expected.  I thought it was the Sanabul product but accidentally ordered this one.  It was good though.
4.0,"As indicated......not great quality, but desent"
4.0,Super cute and adorable! Some were bigger then others but for the most part they all got my 5 month old ok!
4.0,Looks and fits just as pictured as long as you order 2 sizes bigger. I normally wear an XL in hoodies but large in tops. I got a 3xl and it's perfect. MAKE SURE TO READ REVIEWS and size charts.
4.0,"Cute but I bought for my 10 year old daughter and they are shorter on and on person than they look in the pic. I definitely thought they'd be a little longer (and have more coverage) and was trying to get her jean shorts that were cute, but not so short!!! Good stretch and I like the adjustable waist. I'm rating 4 stars only because the pic makes them look longer than they really are. I'd suggest a model for the listing so a more true size snd fit can be seen."
4.0,"Solid, works like it advertises... should be found in every house in America where the pioneer spirit is alive.<br />Remember your 2nd Amendment Rights!"
4.0,I‚Äôm one who In between sizes; 5‚Äô5 around 137lbs. Small check bigger hips. I got a medium which fits perfectly. The suit is comfortable.
4.0,This outfit for perfect. This was my birthday outfit and I received alot compliments.
4.0,My friend liked it very much. I just wished the card was bigger.
4.0,"Love this cute little guy, but watch out - those helmet horns are SHARP!"
4.0,Yes this hoodie runs small and when I say small I wear XL hoodies. I have broad shoulders and it fits fine. It is a little tight around the elbows. The only thing I do not like is the hood is wide. Other than that this is a comfortable hoodie. My wife may steal it away from me...
4.0,"Nice product I will use on my other pair of sunglasses, i would buy again."
4.0,Super cute but too little.  They were worn one time.  Just buy a size bigger than you need and I think you'll get a lot more wear out of them than I did.
4.0,"I really like this top, but it is a little larger than I had expected. I typically wear a small/medium top and the small was a little baggy. Looking back at the model, it does appear that this is how the top is supposed to fit. Also, the colors are slightly different than pictured. The flowers are brighter, but it is still pretty."
4.0,Like the quality of the dress -- did not like the look.  Too high waisted for me and looked funny.
4.0,My 9 year old grandson loved this. He is everything a Godzilla!
4.0,Cute tie my son loved it. It's not the best material but works great for my 10 year old when he wants to dress up.
4.0,What a hit these were at our daughters birthday party!
4.0,Just received this and I personally think it looks nice. I think there's enough room for improvement - like riveting the holes so the belt won't wear too fast. Might update after some time.
4.0,"The new sandal smell goes away really (maybe 2-3 days) after opening the package. The grip on the bottom doesn't seem like much but it works well in the shower. I bought a pair for my son to use while in basic training. &#34;Shower shoes&#34; are a requirement & these are inexpensive yet actually hold up really well. They are MUCH cooler design than those offered to people in the military & they dry incredibly fast. In the military, time is of the essence. With a couple shakes & a quick wipe down (nothing too specific) the sandals are dry & able to be stored neatly in his locker. The sandals are really lightweight. I gave these a 4 over a 5 star because 1) the smell isn't fabulous upon opening but again, it DOES TRULY go away within a couple days & 2) the grip on the bottom, while good, is not great. To improve on this already pretty good sandal, I would simply make the grip on the bottom a little more.... grippy."
4.0,Fits really good. I like the feel of the shirt
4.0,nice for layering it is light weight but not too sheer.
4.0,Very pretty and sexy but the loops hang up on each other sometime which makes it uncomfortable.
4.0,I think it adds a bit of western flare. My younger daughter will probably call me a grandmaüòÖ
4.0,My stepson loves this hoodie! I got it as a present for him and he hasn‚Äôt parted from it sense lol It isn‚Äôt necessarily a thick hoodie so you‚Äôll definitely have to layer under it or over it but the design is clear and looks good. We‚Äôll see how it survives being washed.
4.0,slightly crooked and slightly wider than expected but im still rockin em!
4.0,"I purchased this dress a while back and I finally wore it last week for a women's event at church. The theme was black, white and peals and I received so many compliments! Everyone loved my dress, the perfect amount of pearls not too much, very fashionable and classy. Love, Love, Love!!"
4.0,"These shorts are very comfortable and easily adjustable at the waist by a drawstring and the large waistband. They are a beautiful color that can pair nicely with summer tops and the style has four useable pockets (although the front two are small and mostly decorative). The fabric is a stretchy but thicker material that is not see through but still allows airflow. The fringed ""torn"" bottoms have a stitch running above them so that the pants do not tear themselves but the style is still noticeable. Upon arrival, I washed these in a regular wash cycle and then hung them to dry. There were no loose threads or noticeable wear from this wash cycle.<br /><br />I would recommend these shorts but be aware that they run a bit bigger than usual. I am a 5'7"" woman that is 135lbs. Typically, I size between the small and medium sizes as I have pretty thick legs. These size smalls fit well but the style allowed some bunching in the front. I still like these shorts and look forward to wearing them this summer."
4.0,"These pins are nice but, smaller than expected. I am keeping them and using but, product would be better if a bit larger."
4.0,"The product arrived quickly and seem to be nice quality.  However, I ordered the grey/tan pair.  The grey is really a brown, which is disappointing because I don't wear brown often and would love to have the grey.  I'm not sure if my order was mixed up or if the color is just very off.  Overall good product, but color is not accurate."
4.0,Really great but I wouldn't leave on lips for too long they will leave marks or maybe my lips are fat I don't think so but they do look very realistic
4.0,Was a nice gift to give to a friend who enjoyed it.
4.0,"For the pink you can see everything under it, it's very form fitting it does not get loser as you wear it through the day.<br />So I wear it has a night shirtüëç"
4.0,"Great necklace, especially for the price. Good quality. I received many compliments. The only issue is that the necklace is heavy to wear."
4.0,"This top was really cute and the lace was classy, but it ran way too tight.  If you‚Äôre going to get it you will need to size up especially if you‚Äôre busty."
4.0,I liked the watch but had to return it as the band was too large for my wrist.
4.0,"I don't love rose gold -- other than that I'd give it 5 stars -- very cute face design and nice band, moderate size (not too dainty, not too clunky)."
4.0,"Bought these for my son as his glasses were rubbing on the back of his ears. Initially putting them on is a little trying. The ends are burned to prevent fraying and also provide a tight fit and prevent them from slipping off. I wish the material was a little thicker to provide more cushioning, however, they did help with preventing constant rubbing from the glasses."
4.0,Cute Shorts. They were shorter than I thought they would be but seem comfortable sized a little small.
4.0,There‚Äôs no zipper! I bought an XL - my usual dirndl size - and couldn‚Äôt get the thing over my B cup boobs. Such a shame because my friend has this dress and I LOVE it and so wanted it.
4.0,"Just got this in the mail about a week early, so I'm very pleased with that. Like other reviewers, my hat was stuffed into the smallest packaging possible, likely to reduce the seller shipping fees. I'm wearing it pulled down tight to smooth out the wrinkling from shipping. The fit is the only downside for me. It's too deep, putting the seam of the brim just below to tops of my ears.  I have to tip my head back to see from under the front brim because the hat won't sit right if you try to angle it back so that it doesn't come down so far that it obstructs your vision. That aside, it is super cute & was incredibly cheap so I am very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,Rather small<br />5‚Äô 3‚Äù 150#
4.0,"It's good quality. After washing them as instructed, it is a nice gear for my motorcycle riding. The reason for 4 stars is because it's not quite long enough to cover the neck area when you put the mask on. Overall, it's pretty decent product."
4.0,Dress looks cheap at first glance but it's comfortable and photographs extremely well.
4.0,"I really like the top. Fabric is a little thin, but the sleeves are adorable!"
4.0,Almost exactly like the first watch I had in the 80s.
4.0,"Very cute, but too small in the boobs and the buttons were tough to manage. Had to send it back."
4.0,Fits and looks great but the item on the picture looks see through and what I recived was not. Still looks really cute!
4.0,"very pretty, smaller than I expected"
4.0,Not a bad product. It has was what i needed for my trip to Taiwan and a great price too.
4.0,The lenses are crisp and not too dark. The blue tint is very vivid. I am 6 feet tall and at first thought they were a little small. The wire frame is very light yet feels like a strong material. I hope they last!
4.0,Order up a size or two for sure. It‚Äôs a great top. Just runs super small.
4.0,"It's really adorable!! I'm usually a medium and I got a large, it's slightly snug around my waist but fits nicely. I love it!"
4.0,Was able to give a friend a 2 pairs and she loved how they fit.
4.0,cute shirt at a good price
4.0,"good buy, its durable"
4.0,"Great costume, fit well. Only issues was it was a little hard to see out of."
4.0,"The shirt is good quality and well made.  I'm glad I bought the the next size though because the M is just too small for my slender 12 year old.  There is something wrong with the sizing.  Otherwise, we love it.  The L is a bit large on her but it fits - buttons close and she can move her arms.  The black tie is stylish and she loves that!"
4.0,There were actually two different sizes on tags on this product and it might've been okay had the band around the chest not been sewn in place. It's a nice little apron otherwise though.
4.0,"Bottoms fit perfectly, the top was too tight, ordered an xl but I cut the arms and now it is ok. The material the top is made of is a little scratchy, the tie dye sets are a lot softer. But all in all, nice set."
4.0,"It's so adorable! It does seem more cheaply made so probably won't last long, but it is SO cute! & it was cheap...oh! & I will say the pendent was quite bigger than I would have thought, but I'm getting used to it:)"
4.0,I was going to send it back but the I changed my mind  because it look good. I have it silver as well
4.0,"It's Nice,  I like it, but the date window is too small,"
4.0,Pretty...but too big.
4.0,This is what I was looking for expect it is very thin. It is not what I would classify as a sweater - but more of a long sleeve shirt.  I usually wear medium and I ordered a medium and was able to achieve the loose fit I was looking for. I love the pockets but just wish it was a bit thicker.
4.0,"This is a little larger than I expected, but it is super cute and very comfortable."
4.0,I like this bracelet despite not being able to tell if the stones are real or not. It looks like the picture. The darker beads are rough like lava rock. I have a larger wrist and there are no gaps when wearing it. Would buy again.
4.0,"I adored this dress but it unfortunately did not fit as I hoped. I'm 5'9 , a D cup and ordered 1 large. The length hit above the ankles but honestly I'm used to that. The part I couldn't get past was that the chest fit way too tight. It actually flattened my chest in an unflattering, uncomfortable way. The rest of the fit was nice. It was flowy as I had wanted and pockets are always a plus."
4.0,"It was a bit tough to put this strap on, but I eventually got it on. The band is soft and can accommodate an array of wrist sizes."
4.0,Daughter loves them.  Wish had more vibrant colors.
4.0,Wore this collar for my RBG Halloween costume. Was on the larger (open neck) side but was spot on for the costume
4.0,"Very nice sweater, will be wearing it to Dapper day at Disneyland."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and the belt pulls it together nicely. I'm buying a white petticoat to go under it though, so it doesn't lay as flat."
4.0,"much better than i expected! easy to remove links, and very clean design that fits most cases.<br /><br />however, the clasp is cheap and the edges are sharp, it also pulls arm hair very badly<br /><br />BUT, this is great for the price!"
4.0,So soft! Color is nice!
4.0,"Have 1 other pull over brown print Sawyer Creek styled like this but without the front opening & snaps. After they are washed the crinkle gauze isn't sheer & see-through anymore. So, this can be worn for sleeping & doing early morning outdoor chores. If you're caught you don't feel like you've been caught in your nightie or PJs."
4.0,It is a good watch but I do not like the hard strap. It should be soft. I loved their customer service. They really care about their customers.
4.0,"Two part review - the watch design and the &#34;smart&#34; features.<br /><br />The design is appropriate for casual / business casual.  Nice clean look.  I'd prefer silver to the gold as a complement to black but that's personal preference - it looks sharp.  The band is a pain to adjust (as most bands of this style are) - needed a jeweler to get extra links out to get it to size, but that's just a 1-time effort.  Overall looks sharp<br /><br />The smart features are cool.  It connected easily to my iphone and provides a handful of notifications that are helpful.  Obviously not as much functionality as a touchscreen watch, but not as ugly or big either, and no daily charging needed.  Nice tradeoff to get a few smart features and still a traditional watch look."
4.0,Great value. Size up!
4.0,"Just received the watch, and it genuinely looks amazing... great value for the money you are paying... I have given 4-stars for I just received the product... will increase to 5-stars... definitely buying more of these.. great gift!!"
4.0,Very nice and stylish I wore it to a party! Got many compliments!
4.0,Nice heavy duty cotton material.  Not the thin junk that some companies try to use.  Good button hole sewing and quality buttons.  Collars well constructed.  Best $20 cotton Aloha shirt you could want.  I'm happy with this purchase.
4.0,"The quality of Jazba is as good as many of the famous brands is not promoted to match its high quality. I was reluctant to buy a brand that not as known as Ascics, Adidass or LaCoste, however I'm glad I did."
4.0,I was not able to use it as dress because it was too small to walk out the house almost showing my booty. I ended up wearing it with tights and boots. It looked good anyways. Overall its a nice little dress.
4.0,Worked perfect for my medusa costume
4.0,Bought it for skiing which was a mistake bc it's not what it's meant for. More for non- winter use. It's pretty thin and seems kind of flimsy but does hold well.
4.0,The top fit perfectly and the bottom. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weigh 130 and the small was perfect for me. Gave me old school vibes with the matching jacket which I love
4.0,Good quality. I don't think it's officially licensed (no ubisoft markings) but its still great. if you're looking for the hat and mask this is it. I did have to take in the mask a bit (maybe I have a small head) but other then that it's great!
4.0,"I am an Amazon Prime customer and have bought other sun hats online before. I received this particular sun hat at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I ordered the aqua color. The hat arrived a little crumpled in the box, but because of how the hat is made with a thin wire around the brim, it is easy to mold back into shape. It is made out of polyester, but it is also made to protect you from the sun. It had a UPF of 50+ so is perfect for a sunny climate. It is lightweight, hugs my head well. I plan on taking it on my upcoming beach trip since it packs well by rolling it up and re-working it back into shape.<br /><br />I wish it had a drawstring to keep it on the head for beach purposes. I also wish it was made in the U.S. instead of China. But, other than that, it is a cute hat."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty, but prefer softer shade of pink."
4.0,Overall this is a nice watch for the money. Can't complain when the real thing is $5k and this is $139.<br />Looks very close in the pictures however the gray dial is a little darker than expected. The hands arent white like the Omega's so that makes it harder to read. Still good everyday watch since I can be pretty abusive to them.
4.0,They are really good quality but not easy to put on for children.
4.0,"Simple and easy to use. Buttons are a little too small and light only works on the left side. The 12/24 hour button is too easy to change and activate leading to mild confusion when you see a number you aren‚Äôt expecting. Put it on my 9 month old for funsies and was surprised when it fit so if you have small wrists, you should be covered."
4.0,It was a little on the shorter side then what I was looking for but did the trick. My daughter wanted a metal free one for when she had an MRI as it had not been that long since she got her belly button pierced and did not want to leave it out for a few hours.
4.0,"I love this dress, it‚Äôs soo beautiful. I order a Large and it was too small, the large is like Medium so you need to size up at least 2 sizes. I had to return it and was not able to order another one because my size is not available"
4.0,"small and cheep, but my girlfriend loves it and wears it every day."
4.0,Very comfortable and easy care sleepwear.  Just love them!
4.0,"Style and features of hat are nice.  Only complaint I have is that top portion is very shallow (and I don't have a very big head) so it is hard to keep hat on my head in any type of wind.  It does have a chin strap but I don't like the look of that.  You can tighten head part but that part fits okay, it is just that it doesn't sit low enough on my head."
4.0,"Because it's not American sizes,  it's hard to know what size will work for you. I sized up x2. If you are an American size 2X or 3X & anything higher, this will not fit your body, there's no way.<br /><br />I didn't sweat in mine and the bottom actually turns up like the one in this picture and it's not because I have abs. Maybe that was because of the inability to properly gauge the size I needed which would've been one size lower."
4.0,Nice simple and to the point!!
4.0,"These shoes are made well and are very cute - that's why I gave 4 stars.  HOWEVER - if you have plantar fasciitis as I do, buy a shoe with a thicker heel.  I work 12-13 hour shifts where I sometimes don't sit for longer than 10 minutes, these shoes are not built for those long hours with my feet - they get ""tired"" and my feet are hurting by the end of the shift.  NOT recommended for plantar fasciitis."
4.0,Like the color of bubblious bubble gum. I have small wrist and it was a little on small side and slightly tight to wear leaving a wrist mark.
4.0,This owl is big. I guess I didn't read the dimensions carefully. I know I'll find a use for it.  Definitely fun.
4.0,Thicker than gymshark vital leggings but NOT SQUAT PROOF
4.0,"They seem to be good quality laces. Haven't had a chance to run in them yet, but expecting good results."
4.0,"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear at her dinosaur themed birthday party. She is a true Carter‚Äôs size 4T. I bought this in a 3T on purpose hoping that it would be a bit short to look cute with some pink bike shorts. Even in a size down, this dress is huge. It goes way past her knees and is saggy in the armpits. If I would have gotten her actual size she‚Äôd be swimming in it. Very cute and well made, just enormous."
4.0,Super cute boots! Exactly like pictured. Haven't gotten any use out of them yet but they seem to be well made. They definitely run on the large side in both length and width. I order a 5 because the size 4 walmart shoes I had for DD were getting snug but these were very big so she likely won't get any use out of them for a few more months. I would definitely size down. But overall I'm happy with the product so far.
4.0,I can not wait to wear it out!!!! So cute!
4.0,"Very nice clown hat and easy to wear,"
4.0,"I ordered black in the YuKaiChen Men‚Äôs Jogger Pants, but received them in white.  Fortunately, the white looks nice - the pants are thin, so a bit sheer.  I will purchase them in black. They are nice pants, and fit true to size.  They are more Leisure Wear than training pants, and they look nice paired with casual shirts and jackets for an everyday look.  The material is lightweight, so if wearing in colder temperatures, you might want to layer."
4.0,"I got the camo one and it is so cute, it was a fair price and I love the alien patch...I want every color"
4.0,I bought this for my 17 yrs old son and he loves it.
4.0,I bought this for my brother for Christmas. When I touched it it was rough. It felt kind of cheap and not soft. The design is nice that's it.
4.0,"Good quality hat. I like that it has a Velcro strap to adjust the hat to fit. Looks good.<br />Update to previous review. I have noticed that my hat sits with the emblem off centered while wearing. I can‚Äôt tell for sure if it is the bill of the cap that is off centered or the emblem. However, having said that, it is still a nice cap."
4.0,"Enhanced view while driving at night, I wish the clear frame was a little more sporty"
4.0,Nice purse.  Would have liked to receive MK bag to store the purse in when not in use.
4.0,It is nice but I like to have had more sparkle
4.0,These are really handy and they are quite compact and very well made.  I would have given it a 5 star but the one size fits all is a slight problem.  I have a large mans face and these are just a tiny bit too small.  They are not something you wear all the time so that can be easily overlooked.  A great value and something to keep in your pocket or purse all the time.
4.0,Love it but wish it was just a bit heavier!
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE these earrings.  I would have given it 5 stars , but they were much smaller than I had thought.  They are very good quality and the gems in them are shiny and beautifully done.  I would love these in a bigger size."
4.0,A gift for someone who loved it.
4.0,"Amazon has the best selection of cheap glasses! I felt like a super fly retro 80's guy. They cover your entire eyes including the sides so no annoying distracting reflecting view of your own face while wearing like some other glasses do when the sun is hitting you from the side.<br />The only thing that I don't care for is the lack of support/cushion in the nose area and the bottom of the lens is not smooth, it rests on my cheeks and is kinda rough and rubs my cheeks which can be irritating. Other than that super cool fun glasses that provide comprehensive coverage."
4.0,Beautiful but to small. I wear a 9 1/2 and the 10 felt like a 8 1/2. Sending back
4.0,"I think it is to big, unless it is intended to cover the face"
4.0,I received this from my daughter for Christmas.  Felt like it was a good product with great meaning. Thank you.
4.0,This is a really nice bracelet. For the price it's a great deal. I bought it for my 8 year old son and he loves it! Fast shipping too.
4.0,I didn‚Äôt have any trouble with the clasp like the other reviews said. I did get an ‚ÄúS‚Äù and it does look like it‚Äôs upside down
4.0,Very small ordered a 4x and it fits my 10 year old but looks nice on her.
4.0,I LOVE this necklace! But it came with a couple problems... the pearl that closed the necklace did not actually fit in the hole given for it. I had to untie and reglue to make it fit. Another problem is it came much longer than stated in the discription but now I just tie the back before I put it on and it looks normal (and feels more secure)
4.0,Colour was very vibrant and easy to wear.
4.0,Some were bent which I was surprised but love them and this is the first time there was a problem also didn't receive lava beads fit inside pendant
4.0,"It is very pretty, wish it was a little darker red is all. It arrived on time and in good shape."
4.0,It's a little tight around my head
4.0,very nice shirt needs more colors
4.0,"I like the material used for this product and also the look.  My only problem was the sizing - I ordered a medium (I usually wear a small or medium depending), but the fit was still a little snug.  If I were to order again, I would size up one more and probably get the large.  I do plan to order this again in other colors in the future."
4.0,"Good deal, fit wAs good"
4.0,I purchased this watch about 8 months ago and I have had no problems with it. On thing I would like to say that it very large and heavy. Maybe they could make a little less bulky. Other than this watch is ok.
4.0,"SHIRT IS CUTE AND SEXY, NO STRETCH IN FABRIC,  HOWEVER IT'S TO TIGHT FOR ME I WILL RETURN"
4.0,The print is really beautiful!! Fit is as expected..
4.0,"Very comfortable, warm but not overly so and well worth buying!!"
4.0,Fits a little smaller then TTS.  I do love the rope though.  Lightweight and long enough to wear with leggings
4.0,"Cute suit, just a little tight."
4.0,"I love purchasing something and getting exactly what I hoped for when the item arrives. This swimsuit is just as cute in person as it is in the picture. The crochet part is a tad bit loose, and the top part in the back of the bikini top doesn't stay up as well as I would have liked, but it's still comfortable and for the price I would buy more if they had it in other colors. I'm 5'3&#34; 110 lbs and I purchased a Medium.<br /><br />I bought this last year in 2016 and have only worn it a few times and the metal part that connects the strap to the suit broke - so be mindful of that. If you like strapless suits then it's great, but unfortunately there's not a lot of support so if you have a bigger chest you're SOL on what was a super cute swimsuit."
4.0,"Nice material, very comfee"
4.0,These shirts fit as I expected they would. Have been wearing them everyday for the past four weeks and I have no complaints. I will order more.
4.0,They are nice sandals but they were to big for my size 5 foot. I have them to my niece and she loves them.
4.0,I Love this dress!! Its very faltering. Im a very large chested woman and im able to wear a a regular bra with this dress which is always a plus. im 5'8 and this dress reaches the floor.
4.0,I ordered an xl because the reviews said that it ran small.  Size is perfect.  I like the look and very comfortable.
4.0,I purchased this dress for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised with it! I am typically a medium but a large fit me better. The green color is gorgeous and the fabric of the outer dress is thicker than anticipated. The draping across the front was really flattering. The only drawback is that the inner dress is on the thinner side and tends to ride up. I really loved how it showed off my shoulders.
4.0,"Sizing is the main problem I had. On the whole exactly what I expected. Perfect for a casual situation, that you want to dress up a bit."
4.0,"I wore it a few times, I love the look, it really looks like a quality necklace. However after just a few wearings, it ripped. I'm going to try to get it fixed by a jeweler because I really like it"
4.0,"I ordered a small. So maybe that‚Äôs why it fit me well because I am small. Really cute but the material plus the design, makes it look like a robe according to my boyfriend. Maybe I should have choosen another color."
4.0,"These capris are well made and very comfy. I'm a little nervous about the print coming off after a few washes, but as of yet (2 washes), its holding up well"
4.0,Fit well just shrunk A little bit
4.0,"I liked the belt.  it would of gotten a 4 star,  but I purchased the wrong size."
4.0,Great but need to make larger sizes to fit a greater majority of people.
4.0,These don‚Äôt really block sun very well
4.0,A small problem is little squeezy.
4.0,"I normally wear a 4 but got a 6 since the 6 was a small. I‚Äôm 129-130 lbs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù with a 26‚Äù waist. The zipper sticks a little but the fabric is nice. The aren‚Äôt stretchy per se but they allow movement...I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase and would recommend"
4.0,they could be a little darker
4.0,"one of the clasp broke as I was trying it on... overall, I like them all."
4.0,"Cute, not too comfy."
4.0,So far a nice jacket.  I was hoping it was a little bit heavier weight fleece.  I have found that layer a fleece jacket and a fleece vest will do quite well for keeping me warm.  This jacket will be the one I likely will use the most under the vest that I have been using lately.
4.0,"The straps doesn‚Äôt have a hole in them, have to make it yourself"
4.0,"Looks great, material is a little thin/see thru"
4.0,"The sunglasses fit great over my prescription glasses. The polarized lense gives you a clear view. Only thing I dislike is a strong chemical smell that has not gone away, I washed them with soap and water but the smell is still there."
4.0,Super cute mermaid tail charms but the packaging should be a little better as two arrived broken
4.0,"Nice and simple cotton nighttime shorts, but a little on the big size. I will probably buy some more in future but will a size smaller."
4.0,"Order a size down. No idea who wrote the size chart, but the item is way bigger by about 3-4 inches all around."
4.0,"Nice basic shower shoe that dries quickly and does not smell like mildew like other absorbent sandals do. As far as those that said the shoes smell like plastic when taking them out of the bag, I found that to be true, but that odor went away after leaving them outside for a day."
4.0,perfect for labeling bags
4.0,Great mask!! Great quality<br />Just didn‚Äôt get to use it as a costume because I changes My mind
4.0,It seems to be a nice jacket but because it is big at the bottom/back I can't appreciate it. I will be sending it back but am strongly contemplating getting it in another size.
4.0,This coverup fits as expected and runs true to size. It is a bit shorter than I would have liked. It doesn't really cover much at all. It looks pretty similar to the photos. I just wish it was a little longer.<br /><br />*disclosure: I recieved this product for free in exchange for an honest unbiased review.*
4.0,"Love the pendant! So sparkly and cute. The pendant is made well, however the chain didn't last a day. Only reason I gave 4 stars. My 7 year old grand baby loves it! Looks great with dresses. For the price it can't be beat."
4.0,Love it. It was delivered quick and there's more than enough room for everything I need in it. The only problem I have is when cash is in it if it isn't all the way down the zipper catches on it sadly.
4.0,"Loved the idea of a McDonald's type face mask for our teen son who works at McDonald's. Unfortunately he said the fabric is really difficult to breath through, especially when working. It clings to his mouth/nose and just isn't very breathable. More of a novelty mask to me, but still cute. Others may love, so I would still recommend."
4.0,"I'm fairly petite. Im 5', weight about 100 lb, and usually wear size small or extra small.<br />I ordered a small and its really big on me. The sleeves run past my wrists, almost covering my entire hand. The shirt is really big and long but that's ok for me because I tuck it in. The material is a bit see through, but its not a big deal for me.<br />The quality of the shirt is not that good. Threads are all over the place and peeking out.<br />It's a really nice and dainty piece and for the price. I just had higher expectations for it.<br />Would I repurchase or recommend as a long term clothset piece? Probably not. It'll work for now but I'll want a better quality piece in the future."
4.0,"I wear a man size 8 or 8.5, so I bought a medium. VERY TIGHT, too small.  I like the socks, so I bought a size larger.  The large works well."
4.0,"In comparison to other brands from Shein , the price might be a little high as it compares well to those . But the items themselves were good and the color options were great too . They add fair support and the quality looks like it will hold ."
4.0,Well made and cute.  I'm considering buying in another color.
4.0,"Great purchase. Fits well and looks nice. I purchased the red brown option. Take note that the brown option comes with black attachment straps for the space gray Apple Watch. If you have a silver or aluminum watch, you‚Äôll want to purchase the red brown option like I did."
4.0,The hat was nice and glasses were cute with the bandanna the only down side was the hat was in a small box rolled up with bandanna and glasses and the hat was so out of shape took awhile to get it to look nice
4.0,"YEEPSYS Womens Yoga Running Capris Leggings Workout Pants Tummy Control High Waisted Sports Gym<br />Size Large - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs.<br /><br />No front center seam and only a small back center seam that is gathered. Not very flattering on me. There are black dark spots that look like smiles right under your butt cheeks; not sure why they are there but I don't really like the look. I didn't notice that when I ordered them. The legs fit okay and the material is not bad but these would not be my go to yoga pants unless I wore a really long top! 4 Stars - Nicely made even if I don't prefer the style. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,It's a very nice bag but it's very large...and kind of heavy. If I was taller and had more stuff to carry I would definitely use it!!
4.0,Cute little mug. Only gave this 4 stars because the lettering is blurred. Like the ink smeared a little. Still readable tho.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, but I fear the image makes it look longer than it really is. It more closely encircles my neck than I was hoping."
4.0,I wore these only once I just happen to be wearing boots at the time.  They snagged on the leg buckle on the boot had to change because it left a whole in the leg.  I really loved how these felt while on so if you can be more careful than me I would recommend them.
4.0,"Bought this for my son so he can dance like a jabowockee... while it did not improve his dancing, it does shield his identity so no one know its him, which is good until he heys batter at dancing."
4.0,Very cute .. love it<br />More room in side  than I thought
4.0,Nice looking but my wrist is in between two link sizes and impossible to fit me
4.0,"Love this, ordered to wear with navy capri leggings, I have had a ton of compliments! Very nice fabric flows perfectl! I have purchased several others in long sleeve, they are all awesome!"
4.0,The kids love them. They fit well and came with adjustable straps. Only complaint is the little ‚Äústopper‚Äù for the adjustable straps came off in the wash.
4.0,"Love the dress but overall too tight, from chest to ‚Äúskirt.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt  walk in the dress. Thinking of maybe ordering a medium?!?!?"
4.0,My 4 yr old size 5T absolutely loves them. Get 1 size up as the arms and legs do run slim.
4.0,"I'm glad it came in time for my trip to the beach, but I'm sad its soo small. It's cute and all, but it's just not large enough for actual storage of some personal items. Regardless, I have a Flounder purse, and I intend on using it to the fullest. Not a bad buy."
4.0,"Great quality, comfortable and it looks good. Put it on and you'll automatically feel like you've just obtained superpowers you've never even imagined before. Not lame shit like super strength or super speed but like crazy kinda super powers you can't imagine. But, beware of the attention you might receive because it also acts as a visual aphrodisiac for people of any genders, this hoodie does not discriminate. It will love you and stay with you till you're old and crusty, not like the people you hangout with and call your &#34;friends&#34;.  But on the reals it's actually a really good hoodie for the amount of money you're paying for this product."
4.0,"Ties are too long. Otherwise, sewn well & nice fabric."
4.0,"These sandals fit well, but the surface of the footpad has a small waffle weave type of surface. This feels a little rough and a bit annoying. Eventually I either have gotten used to it, or my feet lost a little sensitivity.<br />I do like these sandals a lot and I really like the animal print on the straps. Other than the surface of the footbed being a little annoying at first, these do offer some comfort. The padding is comfortable, as so are the straps. Speaking of the straps, they are a bit long when I adjust the sandal straps to my feet. I will eventually cut them down in size and sew the trimmed edges.<br />If you have narrow feet, I would probably go down a size.<br />I do recommend these sandals, and if the footbed is redesigned to a smoother surface, then I would highly recommend."
4.0,The pants were smaller than the jackets so I couldn't put them together without it squeezing him
4.0,Comfortable I think they run small
4.0,These earrings are great! The price was fantastic for three sets of earrings and they're very stylish. Already had a few people ask me what it was like to get gauges in my ears. I'd advise not to wear them 24/7 as they can get a little stinky since there's not much breathing room in between the earrings and your earlobe.
4.0,My 4 year old grandson told me I was beautiful in this
4.0,The outside seam for the right leg came apart for a length of about 3 inches. I will have to hand sew it shut. I am hoping no other seams fall apart
4.0,"I have a narrow rib cage due to my petite frame. This was slightly loose fitting. Looked nice but would be better if slightly snugger in waist.<br /><br />30D bra size, 5'2&#34;, size 2 pant.<br /><br />Soft comfy outfit, decent quality for the price. Adjustable straps allow for a much taller petite gal to wear this just fine."
4.0,"This cami fits true to size, but it is very long! That being said, it is soft and feels nice, although I wish the straps were a bit wider. Also, I wish the straps would &quot;seat&quot; a little better - I have a heavier bust, and the straps slip a little"
4.0,"If you want fine jewelry, these are neither gold or silver pieces. They are more than adequate for my purposes; I wanted then for casual sweater wear to prevent my constantly tugging at my sweaters to keep them in place."
4.0,"Dress length was way too long.. touch the door. Even with heels on. I'm 5'4, 130, bought a medium. Its stretchy so I could've bought a small.  However the dress style and design is one of a kind,  and for that it deserves a 4 star."
4.0,very pretty but I read the other reviews & ordered a larger size. It was too big. I probably will not pay attention to the reviews as much next time. some people are basically poopoo heads :  ). Great price so I gave it to a friend. She loved it
4.0,"While these bras seem to be of good quality, they are way too small for me even after ordering the recommended size! Looks like I should have ordered a size larger."
4.0,Previous Russell sweatshirt was large so bought same size.  This new one is larger in the shoulders but glad I bought this size as my arms are long and sleeves are just right.
4.0,Very nice. Received several compliments while wearing.
4.0,"If you are going to a costume party, or for Halloween, then this is your necklace.  It could pass for Indian or even Egyptian.  But no one is going to think these pass for the real thing.  Not sure someone would wear it while doing Indian dancing but they might.  It's a good set and hopefully a good price point."
4.0,Pretty good quality. Definitely polarized so good deal for the price.
4.0,I bought this as a post-trip souvenir for my son because it was the one island we visited where we didn't get him something and I felt like his collection was incomplete. This was a cute inexpensive souvenir to add to his &#34;treasure chest&#34; of vacation trinkets.
4.0,The product brought immediate relief. Thank you
4.0,I like the fact that the hat has spf50.  The brim was ok but it kept hitting the back of my neck.  If I adjused it so it did not touch my neck then I could not see out of it.  It fit as expected.
4.0,This skirt has a light material (eyelets). Very soft. Size down. I am normally a size size 16 but the 15 fit me perfect. One downside is that the cut in the front isn‚Äôt a smooth finish
4.0,"I had ordered one of theseTempered Glass Cover when I got my new phone.  As it happens, I dropped my phone on a cement floor at a store.  The glass covet saved my phone screen. Ordered another one very same day, wouldn't do without it."
4.0,"I typically wear a size 2 dress in US sizes, so the size I picked was accurate. I will note that the most of other bridesmaids had sizing issues, saying that it ran too small on them. I am unsure if they did not read the size chart correctly or not, but if you're not petite it may be good to order a size up. Easier to get a dress taken in rather than trying to make it bigger. Besides the length, mine fit pretty well. I did end up getting alterations to cut 7 inches off the bottom, as the dress was very long on me - I am 5 feet tall. I attached a before alteration and after alteration photo."
4.0,Absolutely lovely. It's similar to an expensive ring I saw in the jewelry store
4.0,"It's a little bit long, but I like it! The dress is very comfortable."
4.0,"I purchased a Large size dress......and wore this dress today for the first time. It is a comfortable fit for me for the most part, (I am pear shaped, 5' 1&#34; and 140) but a little lose on the top.  I did purchase a large after reading the reviews of others....I do wonder if I should have gotten a medium?  In any case, I did read conflicting &#34; wash/care &#34; instructions.  I may amend this review if this dress does not launder well."
4.0,fit when i tried it on need to find somewhere to wear it
4.0,"I like the sweater itself; however it runs small, so buy a larger size than you usually wear.  I wish I had, now I have a sweater that is too small and because the seller wants me to pay return postage, have wasted my money."
4.0,"They're soft & comfortable and fit pretty well. The passing moves around & outs sort of small for the size of the bra. I'll probably just remove them. I'm a little worried about how they'll hold up over washings, but there's no way to know for sure yet."
4.0,"I will say the chain broke within a month, but that is easily replaced and she IS 9 after all."
4.0,I wanted something to keep my hair out of my face and cover my hair during this COVID crisis. I ordered the cap not knowing what to expect. The cap is slightly larger and I have a small head but it was easily adjustable to fit my small head. I washed before using and I know it said dont dry but I did and it came out fine. I like the cap its light weight and will be ordering more.
4.0,So comfortable and light weight. Perfect for my retro April O'Neil Cosplay...need to think of more characters to wear this with!!! Only down side is that its very see thru. Get nude undies üòâ
4.0,"Shirts fit good and I love the material, would give it 5 stars but the ‚Äúred‚Äù isn‚Äôt really red. It‚Äôs more of a burnt red color which is not what it looked like. My baseball team is royal blue and cardinal red which is what I thought I was getting.  Oh well, 2/3 isn‚Äôt bad."
4.0,"Received 20 pins and a lanyard, just as advertised. My kids will enjoy these to get them started on their pin trading journey at Disney World this summer!<br />My only complaint is that one of the pins is missing the backing and the pin is bent pretty severly so I'm guessing it will not be tradable."
4.0,Fit and looks good great price and fair quality.
4.0,"it is not bad jump suit for this price. I am not sure it is 100% cotton as it electrifies. But the fabric is very soft and comfortable for the hit weather especially.<br />I am 10 in size, fair to say I bought XL based on reviews. It fits, but I would fil better with XXL if it exists."
4.0,"La Misma llego a tiempo y es de buena calidad, buena relaci√≥n precio calidad."
4.0,Size a little big
4.0,"It‚Äôs a nice bracelet for the cost, but one of the wire loops was not fully wound and had very sharp metal exposed that would easy scratch into human flesh. I guess you get what you pay for? I can easily use needle nose pliers and fix this."
4.0,"Earrings are nice, but a little heavier than I‚Äôm use too. The earrings do provide a nice classy look to any outfit."
4.0,"This was a good quality shirt, but the fabric was thicker than I would have liked. I was going to wear it to Begas but I knew I would roast in it."
4.0,A gift for my niece. She loved them.
4.0,"I love how comfortable and cool this nightgown is.  I ordered a large and probably could have ordered a medium.  The instructions say to hang dry but I took a chance and put it in the dryer since it was a little large anyway, and it came out fine."
4.0,Love this dress but it is a bit long.  It is super soft and very comfortable. I usually wear a XL  but after doing the estimated size test it said if i want loose to go with the XXL. Im happy i did it floats on my body not clingy at all!
4.0,Wished the dress went to my ankles or a bit below but i still really like it. It's comfy and fits my figure comfortably without being tight.
4.0,probably sized a little small.
4.0,"The body fits good it's just not snug at the legs for me,otherwise it looks great!!"
4.0,"It is a great organizer, sturdy construction so it holds your bag open for easy access to the contents however it‚Äôs so big it only fits a giant tote bag/purse. Nice pink felt fabric."
4.0,"very attractive print that people appreciate.  I have two quibbles; in the left background the planes appear to be propeller driven while the bow antenna clearly dates from the 1990s, and more importantly, the ship carries the hull number of the USS Missouri (BB-63) rather than that of the Wisconsin (BB-64)."
4.0,"Really nice dress, good material and not sheer at all. Only issue is I wish the straps were maybe an inch or 2 longer. Other than that, no complaints. It still fits well"
4.0,Get it! You know you love it ;D
4.0,WAS FOR A TAALLLLLL VERY TALLL PERSON .. had to return .
4.0,For me I was disappointed that there was only one large bag in the 7-piece package. There are 6 medium size bags however the large bag is the most practical. I was able to put in three pairs each of jeans and yoga pants and a pair of shorts<br />Another feature I feel would be really practical would be to have a small clear patch sewn on the top of each bag where you could add a paper label to identify the items in each bag. I'm sure every time I use the travel bags  I will be packing differently  for each trip . I think it would be cool if the different size bags were different colors again to easily identify items. When I use my travel bags I was gone for over a month and I think if I would have had (or made!) labels I could have been even more organized.
4.0,Color a bit off.
4.0,"I was slightly disappointed when I received them because the color is noticeable.  I considered sending them back but I decided to gift them to my wife and let her decide after she saw them.  She loves them.  She has worn them almost every day since I gave them to her (which was a couple months ago).  Beside the gems themselves, she also really likes the backings.  If you're looking for something clear/white/blue-tint these aren't for you.  If you're looking for something sparkly and beautiful and don't mind the yellow/green-tint then they are really nice!"
4.0,"The enamel isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs not bad and it‚Äôs a comfortable little thing."
4.0,"Stretchy soft material runs big, a bit more revealing than I thought or hoped for. Once I accessorize, I'll make it work to my advantage."
4.0,"Great, but a little too much toe and heel space... good to have it more loose in those spots, but it's a bit too baggy and bunches up in my shoes (the rest is very nicely tight though)... would still buy more if they came in all white with no markings or less loud ones (we're supposed to have plain white socks in my job and the markings come up over my shoes/clogs/crocks)."
4.0,"Fits slightly bigger than expected, but not by a full size.  Comfortable and nice for a nursing mom"
4.0,"This sweater runs really large. I could have gone down a size and still had that slightly baggy look that the model in the picture has. The color seems pretty spot on,  the overall look of it is really cute. I didnt see any washing directions but the tag said it's a 100 percent acrylic material. It came vaccume sealed. It's soft and comfortable. I would totally buy another one a size smaller!"
4.0,Very pretty.  I bought them to wear with my white gold earrings and the silver was much brighter than the deepness in white gold. Need to wear them separately.
4.0,Little small but sexy
4.0,Was a little smaller than I expected but still very nice!
4.0,love it .would have preferred the color on the pic but its still lovely
4.0,This is a medium weight fabric great for at home lounging . Length was good I am tall and it‚Äôs long enough for me . I‚Äôve waged it and it held up .<br />Only down side is the elastic is too firm and tight . It would be more comfortable with less firm elastic or just the tie up .
4.0,The color has more of a nude/light yellow tone to it. It appears to have a pinkish nude color in the picture.
4.0,"This item is lightweight, not bulky. Easy to adjust and wear under clothes. I have been wearing it when I go to work or on walks. It appears slimming and with exercise produce sweat which is the purpose for burning fat. I am happy with this product. It is simple, and I would recommend it to others."
4.0,They are more for children
4.0,Corren un poco peque√±os
4.0,"Look good, easy on/off. Need more time to judge how they hold up."
4.0,I like it. It's appears to look more expensive than it is!
4.0,Adorable slippers. Seem like good quality.  A little big on my daughter but she is able to keep them on.
4.0,"Soft & comfortable, great thanks"
4.0,I started taking it I don‚Äôt think it has been enough time to see if it is working
4.0,"I  REALLY  LIKE THIS MASK.  I  LOVE THE COLORS, VERY NICE ü§óü§ó"
4.0,"I recently bought from another vendor a similar watch band. Unfortunately, that band's cheap 'metal' buckle gave way only 3 wks after I first put it on my wrist - (Synthetic Leather Strap - Barron Watch Company - it had over 150 reviews).<br />So I had to re-order another watch band and decided on this one as a replacement. One major difference I noticed immediately was the thicker, stronger buckle and D-rings. The leather of this watch is similar to the one I had to replace - except this band has a rough (unfinished) inner side - that however, takes nothing away from the quality, look or comfort. I'm very satisfied so far.....as an aside - this band's lenght is slightly longer then my previous one...by about a 1/ 2 of an inch."
4.0,Love this sweater! Very soft and cozy. Would have given it 5 stars but it gets pulls easily.
4.0,Cleans well but brush bristles had disintegrated from handle
4.0,"I purchased this headband with the intention of placing it upon my brow and then being able to smite my foes and evildoers everywhere, but I think I may be using it wrong.  The first night I had it, I had a little ceremony at my shrine.  Its not so much a shrine as a desk with a statue of one of those cats whose paw goes up and down, some plastic flowers, and unlit incense.  I used to light the incense but the smoke really agitates my mom's IBS or COPD or something.  But anyway, after my ceremony I donned the sacred headband and headed to the local truck-stop to find some ne'er-do-wells.  That is when I discovered the lack of powers.  Rather than ""Sweep the leg, Johnny!"" and great cheering all I heard was a resounding chorus of profanity and an intense feeling of both pain and shame as the truckers violated me with what I believe to be a prophylactic filled with meth which was then swiftly removed and used to club me about the head and neck.  I only managed to escape by telling them I heard the Feds were on their way disguised as bikers.  As luck would have it, a huge biker gang pulled up at that moment and the truckers, believing the bikers to be Feds, attacked them.  I huge, tattooed, rumble erupted like a Jack Daniels and Fentanyl fueled scene out of an alternate universe West Side Story.  Anyway, I am home now and will check to see if perhaps the headband requires batteries or a different ceremony of some kind.  Tomorrow I shall descend upon the docks in search of dishonest Longshoremen ."
4.0,Returned as not correct size/fit
4.0,This is a good product for the &#34;blu-blocker&#34; market - is much larger than the small clip-ons blu-blocker has. Blu-blocker may be unaware the pendulum is swinging back toward a larger lens for a larger field of vision - this one is REALLY large.
4.0,"Initially was pleasantly surprised that these worked very well.  Then, a few days after the return window closed, one shoe is malfunctioning.  It will take a charge but will not change colors or turn off.  It stays illuminated and stuck on green.  My daughter can't wear them to school if she can't turn them off during class time.  She's now really disappointed that she only got about a month to wear them before they malfunctioned.  Would not buy these again.<br /><br />Update 6/26/17 - the seller contacted us and replaced the shoes - so far so good!  Changed my rating because the seller had the integrity to stand behind their product.  Thank you!!"
4.0,They're sunglasses. They fit. They work. What more is there to say?
4.0,"Pretty shoes, fit seems acurate, the only thing I am not sure about is that the back of the shoe goes up high - about as high as converse high tops"
4.0,"but I just give it away as a present! and the person it's so happy about it, receiving compliments and asking for more!!"
4.0,These arrived and were just as they were pictured.
4.0,"Cute set, quality as expected."
4.0,Very nice accessories and compliments the attorney for which it was selected
4.0,"I have purchased 4 pairs of these shorts in various colors. They are comfortable to wear and have a lot of pocket options to include items for hiking or everyday use. Two issues:  First the D rings should be higher on the shorts to be useful because they are placed far too low to be used for keys. But more importantly, a large hole has developed in the lower pouch pocket on the left on one of the shorts - the threading seems to have just come apart - and I had items fall out through the large hole. So better sewing would be in order. So far this has happened only only one pair (the pair I wear the most)."
4.0,I like them. However they tend to stain easily
4.0,This is a very pretty shirt I like the puffy part of the shoulders I paired it with a pair of red jeggings and it work out fine
4.0,big thumbs up!!!!!
4.0,Glasses are pretty comfortable. The magnification is a bit low for me causing me to have to tilt my head back pretty far or hold an item close to my chest. Would be nice if it was a bit larger.
4.0,"I bought this skirt in size M, it fits my body very well. I usually wear it in office, the skirt has very decent length and the material feels nice."
4.0,The pants are absolutely amazing I just should have went down one size.
4.0,"Did not expect two pairs. That was a nice surprise. The protective pouches are nice too. These do a great job of cutting down glare,and the bi-focal keeps from switching to read dashboard instruments,  but after prolonged wearing (Cleveland to Philly) I started feeling pressure behind the ears after about two hours."
4.0,These shirts definitely are NOT stain resistant
4.0,"A bit thin, but great stocking stuffer for my son-in-law who loves Rick & Morty. Would give 5 stars if they were a bit thicker."
4.0,"I ordered theses goggles to protect my eyes during this time of Covid19. They fit very well, with or without my glasses. But I received one pair per order, I also ordered them for two friends, and they received 5 pairs per order. Same price, but you never know if you‚Äôll get one or five pairs."
4.0,Very cute addition to my bracelet.
4.0,I ordered a 2xl and received a Xl. The Xl is smaller I would like the jacket to fit because of my midsection! I have to keep it unbuttoned to wear it. I can make it work for special evenings as I try to lose some of my tummy! I like the jacket!
4.0,Great watch for great price!
4.0,Liked. Giftable.
4.0,"This soft pullover runs just a little large, but I think that adds to its comfort.  The fabric is rather thin, but that will be perfect for the rising temperatures of Spring and Summer.  The grey color I chose pairs well with most anything.  The buttons are a cute accent.  The pockets are small, so don't expect them to fit your large smartphone.  The shirt washes nicely, but I wash it inside out to protect the buttons.  I only dry it on low until 2/3 dry and then hang it.  It seems to retain its size and shape when washed and dried this way."
4.0,love this they were delivered quickly and looked great
4.0,"I like these slippers, because they are very funny and quality is great. The only thing is that the price is also high"
4.0,The sweater was perfect except I should have ordered up a size. Very fast shipping
4.0,Extremely stretchy and very comfortable.  Can be dressed up or down
4.0,I wish it was a little easier to put the filter in.
4.0,"Very light, fits just right. great over all!"
4.0,Shirt fit good. Like style.
4.0,"The material is great and is very breathable. but the padding is very minimal. I was hoping for thicker pads on the shoulders, elbows, and back. Other than that, it fits great and looks good."
4.0,My son loves this belt. He usually wears medium but after reading reviews I decided to order a size up. And good thing I did! The belt fits perfectly with some room to grow. The holes go almost the entire length of the belt.
4.0,It wasn‚Äôt exactly the one I wanted that was in the picture I got something different.
4.0,"I bought these for a wedding. The 7.5 fits me well, that is my shoe size. They do hurt but that is why I ordered them a few weeks early so I could try to wear them in. It didn't work they are still super hard and hurt my feet the day of the wedding.  I took them off as soon as the ceremony ended. I don't think I will be wearing them again."
4.0,"this was a gift , they loved it when they opened the package. delivered within a couple of days. Happy customer."
4.0,Kids loved them and wear them all the time. But the ends of the earpieces were rough and had to be smoothed with emery.
4.0,Very happy with purchase. A wallet insert for pictures for new wallet I purchased for my hubby! He loves it!
4.0,"I just got my set of Smart No-Tie Elastic Shoelaces by Alldeals Never Tie Shoes with Fastening System. They are great and so easy to use.<br /><br />These shoestrings are very easy to fit and one size fits all. Alldeals shoes laces come in 48&#34; inches in length and can stretch up to 72&#34; inches.<br /><br />These strings are designed with your comfort and practicality in mind. They save so much time and my son loves them.<br /><br />My son said that these distributes pressure evenly over his foot, unlike the regular strings that came with his shoes. These make you have comfortable feet. Not tired achy feet.<br /><br />My son plays football and it was such a hassle to have to untie and tie his shoes to put them on and take them off, with these they save you time each day putting your shoes on & off because you can just slip them off and on.<br /><br />No more worries about your shoe laces coming undone during your run, cycle or gym sessions because these are secured in two different ways.<br /><br />All I had to do was lace them up cut them a little after I slid the lock on and then at the end of the string put the other lock on. Then you are ready to go.<br /><br />The best part is that they fit all popular shoe brands, Nike, New Balance, Converse, Vans, Jordan Etc. So the hunt of finding the right shoe string is finally over! I received a discount on these strings to test them and try them out in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the Smart No-Tie Elastic Shoelaces by Alldeals Never Tie Shoes with Fastening System."
4.0,"Leaks feathers,  but warmer than expected. Good for layering."
4.0,"For this price, I really like this. Simple and cute."
4.0,"Worked great for our 4 year old, however the bag ripped where the strap attaches not long after we got it.  The other one we got fit our 11 year old."
4.0,"My wife wears these and she is a night shift RN supervisor. She loves compression socks for her 12-16 hour shifts. Compression socks help keep her leg muscles from getting sore on these extended shifts. She also runs 3-4 times per week and likes to use them for running and/or recovery after runs.<br /><br />These socks fit her well well. They are not too tight and not too loose. They have a good amount of compression in them. They stay up on her legs pretty well with minimal adjustments throughout her long shifts.<br /><br />She has a few other pairs, some of which have not lasted all that long, these are newer and are holding up well so far. They get worn weekly and are performing well. Some compression socks I own cost $50. These are much less but seem to be almost as good. In my experience with compression socks, some tend to be overly constricting and some tend to not stay up well. These Go2 socks seem to be a good combination of compression and quality so far. I was sent these socks as a free sample for testing and reviewing purposes.<br /><br />So far, so good. I will update this review should anything change."
4.0,"These are really pretty, but a little smaller than I expected.  They really sparkle and the clasp is very tight...I could sleep in them and not worry about losing one. Good quality, great price...ONly reason I didn't give 5 start is because the size was smaller than I wanted and that it has been hard to get them off a couple times because the clasp is super tight.  I just put a pair of tweezers in the middle between my ear and the metal and when I let go, they opened enough to force the earring apart without causing any damage."
4.0,my nephew loves them!
4.0,"Bought this as a replacement for my hub's minimalist wallet; sturdy, well-made, with ample sleeve sections for items. Only remark from hubby was &#34;It's wider than my previous one&#34;.......not sure if this is an issue, but was noted.  This honest review was submitted in exchange for a reduction in cost."
4.0,The bottom is a bit tight which makes it an it ofna challenge to get into but once I am in I feel great. And I can still work out comfortably. It feels durable and does not shift during my workout
4.0,"It is very nice.  I would have paid more for it to be a bit larger.<br />Thank you, I will order from you again.<br />Elizabeth Butterfield"
4.0,Really good product. The only problem is the short chain.
4.0,Runs large in my opinion.
4.0,"The only thing that stopped me from giving this a 5 star is they feel cheap, although they do not look it."
4.0,"This is a really cute sweater. Unfortunately, it was a bit shorter than I expected. I'm 5'5&#34; and it hit right above my waist. I gave it to one of my friends that is shorter than me and she loves it."
4.0,"it was too big on me. I am 5'5, 34B and 135 lb. The dress itself was beautiful (the color was perfect) and I was hoping I could make it work, but it was just a little too lose all over. I ordered a small. I would have reordered if there was an XS."
4.0,Not bad for $10. Hard to find sunglasses for and xl head these fit.
4.0,"Good quality sweatshirt for the money. I noticed a lot of discussion about size running large in previous post.<br />Here is my take. I normally wear somewhere between a XL and a XXL. I ordered the XL and it fits perfect for me meaning it's a loose fit. (after washing)<br />I'm 6'2&#34; 225 lbs. Yes, the larger than normal sleeves close to the body of the shirt are a little annoying."
4.0,"Their fine, just thought they might have a little stronger vision."
4.0,"Basic silver ball earrings, no complaints."
4.0,Purchased for grandson.  He liked the comfort but thought the size was a little small
4.0,"Purchased for son who is post-stroke. The socks are comfortable, warm & safer than regular socks. He is pleased with the degree of stretch."
4.0,Order a size down! It‚Äôs very loose fitting but comfortable as hell and a lil sexy.
4.0,Very beautiful but too small. I would recommend going up at least a size. The material is nice and it seems well constructed. I'm keeping it and maybe I can lose weight to wear it :)
4.0,"This bag is just as it looks in the photo. It has two sides, one inside zipper pocket and two small open pockets inside each section. It's a sturdy bag and has enough space for everyday work items.<br /><br />Pros: Sturdy, not too bulky, has an over-the-shoulder strap when needed<br />Cons: The zipper end sticks out and isn't sewn into the bag ends, which is a preference thing. The large button hook gets in the way when zipping sometimes.<br /><br />Overall the bag is great. If there was a version without the button, I'd buy that one as well."
4.0,It‚Äôs lightweight and ok.  Left pocket wasn‚Äôt sewn shut so I won‚Äôt be able to use it but otherwise fine.  Rather short and a good fit for my full figure.
4.0,I ordered a medium  - I'm 5' 8&#34; and 142 lbs and it fit just right.  The skirt fabrice was not what I expected - it almost looks like lycra.  But it hangs very nicely and looks very vibrant.  The red belt is a very colorful accent - I don't think I'd like it without the belt (some of the colors came without one).  And the price cannot be beat.  I would recommend this dress.
4.0,Thought it was much larger
4.0,"Cute and does the job. Sometimes hard to get it on the earring backing. So if you have long nails, you will hav problems."
4.0,they stay on better than I thought they would.
4.0,"I like the style of the glasses. But they are snug enough on my face/nose.  If they fit tighter, I would have given them 5-stars."
4.0,Please buy a larger sixe - this coat runs really small - I am a size 6 and I got an XXL it fits fine with a sweater under it.
4.0,This is an attractive belt with a fun secondary function: It will also keep your pants up!<br />/ a fifth star would be awarded if the belt were a tad thinner. It is &#34;jeans&#34; width making it a bit heavily constructed for active outdoor pursuits.
4.0,Cute and sleek. Kinda small on the frame handles
4.0,"Nice tie, just what I wanted. Appears to be of excellent quality"
4.0,"Great earrings for the price, just a bit too big for me. Also the free gift was a pleasant surprise, but I won't spoil that for you all."
4.0,I bought the size I normally wear and it‚Äôs a little snug so I suggest ordering a size up
4.0,"Very lightweight, soft material that has a nice little swing when you walk. Great for hot summer. But, I wore my full body shaper because it was a bit too thin for my comfort. I was surprised by the number of compliments I got on this dress. The color is Mocha and I will be getting it in a few more colors!"
4.0,"These fit well, and have a light cotton lining, so they are good! The red one is more towards a shade of burgundy, but they are both cute for the holidays!"
4.0,Very cute and affordable way to complete your costume.
4.0,"The tags are pliable, which should help them bend as they pass through the many chutes and ramps your luggage is affronted with.  The wire hoops have quality connectors to prevent them from snapping off.  The only drawback is due to the raised portion where you write your information - that makes it just a bit hard to write on with most permanent markers..  Have only used them on two trips so far, but I like them, and recommended them to a friend."
4.0,The kid seems to like them
4.0,Tge picture portrays it to be larger but it's small. Pay attention to the dimensions.
4.0,Nice quality snow pants. Fit is true to size.
4.0,Nice lightweight rugged bag but narrow interior
4.0,"I love this ring! It fits perfectly, however, I did not give five stars due to a small black speck within the ring that I cannot get out. This speck has always been in the ring and came like that (it is very small and hard to notice though)"
4.0,"Pretty good quality for the price. A few of them have some strings hanging off, but overall they are pretty nice."
4.0,"Material is clingy, which can be good or bad, depending on the look desired. The material piled after the first wash. Not really happy with that. After only a few times wearing, it looks faded."
4.0,The fit was good. Great for casual wear. The material was soft and comfortable
4.0,The ear loops are too small for an adult. The over all fit and feel are good.
4.0,"I really like the design of the shirt, but it fits bigger than what normally fits me. I am 6ft. 3in. and 170lbs., so normally I am forced to get a large for lengh and baggieness is not usually a problem. However, for this shirt it was a problem. If you are built like me, I reccomend the medium size."
4.0,Great glasses for the price. I lose or break mine a lot.  So these were the perfect solution.
4.0,Exactly as described. Quite sheer so it's perfect for layering. My favorite right now in the cold weather is to wear a long sleeved shirt under it and it looks good.
4.0,"I bought it for my daughter,she told  me she  really love it."
4.0,I love this bracelet.  I bought 2 one for me and one for my daughter.
4.0,Size aren't American.  Order an extra size up.
4.0,She liked it. That's what counts. I thought it was a little small and very fragile. Overall happy with purchase.
4.0,"Absolutely love this bag. Thought I was going to send it back when I first got it because it didn't look big enough, but it really expands to aaccommodate everything I need and it looks great.  My boss loved it so much, I bought her one."
4.0,"I ordered both the new material and the old and definitely prefer the old one because it‚Äôs almost better quality, it is slighty see through but nothing a slip won‚Äôt fix and i would recommend sizing up in the old material. The new material is plushy and thick, i would say it fits true to size though"
4.0,Love the fabric however the fit was very small.
4.0,Price is way cheaper than any others. So although they didnt absorb all the sweat they did help alot and they seem to dry fairly quickly. Overall great value as they are worth swapping out once a week or so. My shop gets very hot so will probably order again this summer.
4.0,"Really cute, better quality than I expected epecially for the price since these are online elsewhere for 12-20 bucks. Shipping was around 3 weeks. I ordered 2 of these to either give one away or have as an extra and they both look the same. It is a little loose on my wrist even with the adjustable clasps but other than that I love it. Great for any Harry Potter fan"
4.0,"Ordered a small, but it's still too big. Didn't like the color options for the XS. Seems like it's good quality and the color is nice."
4.0,A little too tight around the instep-low ankle
4.0,thinner than expexted but very nice ring
4.0,"I like these for working out, I bought two pairs. It said true fit, that part is untrue. I bought a size up from normal and they are still too small, the length just isn‚Äôt there. They are nice to workout in, they don‚Äôt hold heat and sweat like cotton joggers do. I will probably buy two more in a bigger size yet and gauge the fit then. Overall, not bad."
4.0,She loves them fit well and has held up w well
4.0,"nice glasses. inexpensive price, for use in asia. i dont worry if it gets lost. price is reasonable for replacement."
4.0,"It is beautiful but as usual, runs small. I always buy about two sizes larger than I normally wear but in this case it did not work. I will be gifting this to someone but that's okay; she will love it."
4.0,I haven't used this product enough to give five stars. So far it looks good. This is one product that will fit someone with size 14 shoes.<br />Update: these socks are great.definitely five stars.
4.0,"Belt is beautiful, I ordered in two colors.<br />Looks expensive .<br />Would buy again....in other colors."
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful, just what I esa looking for."
4.0,"This dress was originally ordered to serve as a wedding dress, but I ordered something different a week before the wedding because I was nervous that it would not arrive in time.  I arrived two days before I was to travel to my wedding destination, but by then I had already received the other dress and was happy with using the alternate.  I decided to keep this one because it is very nice, and I frequently attend an annual &#34;all white&#34; event that occurs downtown.  I have not worn it yet, so cannot attest to how durable it is, but the material seems as though it would be very comfortable to wear during the outdoor event for which it was kept."
4.0,"Overall a great dress. It's a soft almost t-shirt like material with soft sleeves. The only downside is that the shoulders constantly slipped. There's no ""fit"" there so they kept sliding. I had to safety pin them to my bra in the back. Other than that, I LOVED it."
4.0,This is a great dress!  I bought it one size bigger and it fit perfectly.  The material is a little stretchy which allows for a super comfortable fit.  I got lots of compliments when I wore it.  It also shipped quick .
4.0,"The reason for four stars is because there is no long term use experience yet.<br /><br />This mostly cotton with some spandex blend is preferable for me. I also have the David Archy Micro Modal version. The difference in material feel is noticeable. The 'Modal' version feels thinner. This cotton-spandex blend is thicker but not much more. Both versions are very comfortable for day long wear. Sitting or moving. The trunks have tags, but they are easily removed. The tags says that if you do not know how to remove tags, have your mother do it. Really, the tags does print that. ;)"
4.0,"I‚Äôm a size 12/14 and got the 3XL, the leg holes are cut small but i really liked the design so I‚Äôm going to deal with it.  One thing i don‚Äôt really like is that the bra cups are like Viking helmets - they are very stiff and hold my girls in an unnatural shape.  They are also very narrow.  Other than that, i love the design and high waist hit me perfect."
4.0,wish color was lighter
4.0,Nice and roomy sweatshirt that i got at an insane price of $9.99.Quality product at a great price.Can't go wrong with R A.
4.0,"I  wanted open toe because the longer  you wear closed toe,  the more they pull on your toenails. These are the best I've found. They stay close to your toes. Others worked their way back to my arches. They are not very sheer, but we don't wear these things for beauty, do we?"
4.0,"I really like this ring, but it stands up higher off my hand than I‚Äôd like. It catches on things easier and once it caught and stretched really bad since it‚Äôs not a close circle. I was able to bend it back to fit but now it‚Äôs more oblong. Overall, I‚Äôd buy it again. Especially for the price. Just wish it was a little shorter."
4.0,Bought these for my son and he absolutely loved them. The frame fit great. He loves the polarized lenses and uses them to go fishing on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. He says that he can tell a major difference with the polarized lenses. His eyes do not seem to be as tired and red since he has been wearing them. He looks like Maverick off Top Gun when he wears them. I paid full price for these.
4.0,Little smaller than expected.  Pattern is beautiful
4.0,I have bigger boobs because I'm a bit overweight so I was pleasantly surprised it fit - The size on the bra says XL - I wear a 38C usually - I also  took off the padding and it feels more comfy - I like that it's not too tight but also it doesn't lift my boobs the way I'd like it too but it still looks cute - it gives a basic tank top a little Edge - not sports bra material in my opinion - doesn't support enough
4.0,"Very cute for the price! Small fit well.  I'm 5'6, 132 lbs.  Thin material  but still nice!"
4.0,"I was SHOCKED these are so cute?? I was skeptical bc other sellers were like $15 but these turned out so cute. The inner bra is pretty old fashioned, and I had to take out the cups it came with bc you could see the lining. But I‚Äôm happy with this! 34dd- got an XL"
4.0,Love them. Great shape and price! They feel light but sturdy. Will order again.
4.0,Had to return because was not rapunzel .  Our mistake but the pajamas was pretty and well made
4.0,"I loved this dress. The colors were bright.  The material was soft and flowy. It's a comfortable dress. The neckline is loose, but I think it is to better to adjust for different breast sizes."
4.0,"Here's the deal. It's a great dress. It's pretty, fits nicely and HAS POCKETS. All huge pluses. However I did return it because the sleeves were too loose and drove me crazy. I didn't want to send it back but I knew I wouldn't wear it. For the record, I'm 5', 112 lbs and ordered a S."
4.0,"I love the shape and weight, though I am curious to see how the chain will hold up. It is perfect for a starter amulet and to move bigger and better after this one."
4.0,"Bought these because my engagement and wedding rings started getting tight at 7 months pregnant and these fit really well as a cheap replacement for a few months. The thin design makes them practically unnoticeable compared to a thicker one I tried before these. The small ridges aren't noticable to the touch against my pinkie and middle fingers. My only complaint after wearing the pink and black rings for about a week is that my skin is starting to peel under them. Not a lot, just looks a little scale-like. It could be because I play with them on my fingers or because I'm still adjusting to silicone versus gold. I still like them though and would recommend."
4.0,"I love this bracelet, thought it would have been a darker green, but its beautiful and fits loose, not snug."
4.0,These earrings are very cute.  Good quality for the price but mostly solid turquoise color as another reviewer indicated.  I would have liked them to be a little larger but they are very noticeable on the ear. Good pop of color for business look.  Also great for everyday.  Would have given them a 5 if a bit larger.  Maybe I underestimated 9mm sizing.
4.0,Real cute! Size down though!
4.0,These pants are one of my faves. I like how the material is still legging spandex material but it has a jogger fit. It runs to size. I'm 125 and I got a small and it stills fits baggy in the right areas. Would so buy AGAIN!
4.0,Very comfortable. Good cushion support.
4.0,Love these minimalist earrings.  Perfect for a little something to perk up outfits.
4.0,"This is the best tutu I found to be shorter, but not so short it's like a belt LOL.  Others were so short when fluffed that they didn't even cover part if a bubble butt.  Not conservative, not tacky, just right for a cheeky look. Lights are cool white, looked great."
4.0,Material is a little polyester-y....not as breathable as I'd like. Looks good though.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 145 and this is fairly snug. I was hoping it would be a little looser for comfort. The fabric however, is very soft, and I know that when I get back down to my 135 goal weight, it will fit better ;) It has risky side-boob potential, so probably not a dress to wear in public... it will however be great for around the house when it's triple digits out and you want to be comfortable and cool. The arm holes are pretty snug, so if you have muscles or larger arms, it might be a little tight."
4.0,Decent material but collar is to wide for the size
4.0,"Hey you're getting what you paid for! Cheap price, decent sunglasses. Work on my round face, overall cute frames. They scratch pretty easily but if you're only dropping a few bucks they do the job. I use them mostly for bright NYC mornings and for when it's snowing and windy and you basically need goggles to survive. Arrived on time, got an email from the company to make sure I was satisfied, then several more emails bugging me to review them so honestly, decent solid cheap sunglasses. Nothing wrong with them. Cute and better quality you'd get at one of the fast fashion retailers."
4.0,"I really liked the style, but it ran a little small and it wasn‚Äôt flattering on my chunky hips. I got a medium, I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù 130lb, wide hips."
4.0,Just pay attention to the sizing. it fits really nicely. My only complaint is that I wish it wasn't a shiny material. Mine isn't the dull color (black) you see in the picture it's got a shine to it.
4.0,The small was HUGE on me wish they had a XS because it‚Äôs so cute and so soft
4.0,Very good quality but a bit tight. I have a slightly large head for an adult male
4.0,These masks are lightweight and comfortable.  I just wish the inside fabric was a darker color than white due to makeup.
4.0,"If you need a safe place to keep glasses in, this will do the trick. I wish the inside of the case was a bit softer, but so far it hasn't left any marks on any pairs of my glasses."
4.0,It was okay but i didnt love the material in real life
4.0,Love the fit... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ soft material... Only reason why i am giving it 4 stars is because the top is a little see through... But cute... Don't mind my girls out... 36DDD... I got a large waist is 30 inches...
4.0,"I got this dress in A-Lepoard-Apricot and it is super cute! My only complaint is that it is a little snug around my bust. I am a 34C and ordered a size small. But other than that, it is form fitting aound the bust and flowy and breezy at the bottom. I'm 5'2"" and this dress hits me right above my knee, perfect for work. I typically have a problem with buttons gapping on dresses, but it is sewn together on this dress, so no gapping! Definitely recommend!"
4.0,It‚Äôs not as beefy as I hoped but it‚Äôs nice enough for an inexpensive belt. I‚Äôm not a leather expert so I have no clue whether it‚Äôs genuine or raccoon skin so take it for what it‚Äôs worth.
4.0,"For the price, it‚Äôs a good robe. Seems to be well made and heavier than expected. If I had any complaints, I would prefer the sleeves were less long and the length was longer (it doesn‚Äôt reach my ankles). The hood is perfect, not too big and overall I think once washed it will be soft and comfy for the winter. Would recommend."
4.0,"Looks great on my kids, 8 and 5.  Sadly, these are not even close to fitting adults."
4.0,"Glad I read and heeded the reviews before choosing a size, sized up.  Glad I did, shirt was a hit, cozy and looks good on"
4.0,"Got for my girlfriends, she loves them for her runs!"
4.0,"These are nice heavy canvas type pants.  Love the pockets and the over all fit.  I had to shorten them, but I'm short, so that's normal.  But when I went to shorten them, I noticed that one leg was more than an inch longer than the other.  The hip pockets were also sewn mostly closed.  I was able to easily fix both issues, but if you don't normally shorten your pants, you'll want to make sure the legs are the same length before you commit to keeping these."
4.0,"These glasses are really cute, but I needed a 16 on the bridge measurement. I thought the 17 measurement would be ok, but they slide on my nose a lot."
4.0,"Super soft tee that fit as expected for me. I'm 5'5&#34; and 120 lbs, I ordered an M because I wanted it to be a little baggy and I feel like it was true to size. I took a star off because one small portion of threads at the neckline was coming loose and because the colors being kinda low and the fit kinda made me feel like I had to pull the shirt up higher in the front but that's probably just because I ordered a size up? The colors were true to the image and the material is super soft,  breathable and not too see-through, though, so I think it's a great value for the price."
4.0,"They fit good and I like the support that I feel with these. That being said I don‚Äôt feel that the soles stand up as well as other sneakers I‚Äôve had in the past. I just walk in these, not jog, and I walk an average of 5 miles a day.<br />  I am going to purchase my 3rd. pair soon."
4.0,It's pretty but two wide
4.0,My daughter will love this. Seems to be made well.
4.0,Great quality! The microfiber looks really nice and smooth. The vest did fit small. Definitely buy a larger size if not two sizes up.
4.0,Nice dress material not heavy good fit over all I wear 3x so it did work for me glad I got the dress .
4.0,I love the shoes yet need to return for next size.<br />Quick shipping  arrival.<br />Thank you.
4.0,This was a perfect fit for me
4.0,"This sweater is so cute, it is long as featured in the picture,presented on ther add, I read another customer mention that it wasn't long enough which had me a bit worried as I am a tall 5'9&#34; . This sweater is a prefect length for me to wear with jeans . It is pretty light weight so it isn't going to keep me warm , but I love it so much and am thinking about ordering another one."
4.0,It's a little difficult trying to get the device inside the frame.
4.0,"I normally wear a women's 4 or 6 so the Small fits well and are looser in the legs as pajama pants should be.  They are fairly comfortable, except for the waist.  The waist does fit, so it's not the fit.  It's something about how the waistband is fabricated and is just not very comfortable against my skin.  But overall they do fit okay and are fine to sleep in or lounge in.  As far as the length, they are certainly long enough.  I am 5'6"" and these could actually be an inch shorter and still be fine.  These pajama pants are okay, but I probably would not order them again."
4.0,"Nice product for the price. I just wish it were not shiny material, which causes the tightener to slip and look inexpensive, which it was, so that's fair I suppose!"
4.0,"These handsome, bright swim trunks are well suited (pardon the pun) to a fashionable day at the beach or by the pool. The fabric is light if a bit thin, but not see-through. The stitching is good. The only drawback is the drawstring is a bit of the same fabric and it might not hold up well over time. The print pattern is really cheerful."
4.0,So sexy and material feels good.
4.0,"Is this the best watch band ever? Probably not. Is it super comfortable and inexpensive? Absolutely. I've worn this for over a month now, I do sleep in it but no showering/swimming with this band - it's so comfy. There are scratches on the connectors, but the gold buckle still looks great and the 'leather' (idk if it's real) hasn't started to peel or crack like a lot of other items I've had over the years at the same price point. The connectors are also easy to attach and remove but once connected hold tight, which is another standout above the pack. Only taking away a star because the connectors scratched so easily"
4.0,"The pearl is beautiful and larger than most pearl jewelry in the market.It has a certificate in it. The box is good enough as gift box.<br />It is comfortable when you wear it while you are typing because the band is very thin.<br />It is very good for daily wear to work or at home, won't be &#34;over done&#34;.<br /><br />The reason for 4 star is the band can be improved so put on is not too difficult.<br />I just bought it a few days ago so I will see if the craftmanship on the connection can be lasted long time."
4.0,Really nice watch. It is very robust and doesn't look out of proportion even though it is quite big. The only thing preventing me from giving it five stars is that at night one cannot tell ehat time it is as it doesn't have illumenessence feature.
4.0,"Great helmet. It got here relatively quick considering came from overseas; this is a full helmet will cover your entire head. This can be used for display (it has been polished), cosplay or for Airsoft it. I was planning using it for Airsoft its details are not movie accurate but its good enough. However though it is little small but its a lot better than the Rubies helmet."
4.0,"Overall this is a good value patio umbrella. The green apple is a vibrant color. It‚Äôs a bit to get used to, but I think it makes the patio pop in color. I had a beige umbrella that didn‚Äôt work out, the bottom base trapped snakes in it! This is a simple umbrella 9ft (smaller than my last one, but doesn‚Äôt get stuck on my gutter or scrubs when opening) I bought a base at sears that matches the brown metal. I really bought it for the night time to enjoy the LED lights. Living in FL I‚Äôm not out on the patio too much during the day."
4.0,"It should have a second applicator brush for the other color as you may mix black and brown on it and get it on the shoes.  It all fits into a case that great for travel or simple storage. The quality was better than I expected, actual wood handles, the polish works as good as any I've used."
4.0,Very good item. At least it's worth the money I paid for
4.0,Soft. Better than going to target
4.0,"Looks good, suitable for my Nokia lumia 1520"
4.0,It's smaller than it looks.
4.0,"Nice color selection,fit.Dont know how long they'll last,but like them.Good bargain"
4.0,"Gorgeous shoes! Comfortable and stylish, and look good with almost anything.<br />I have had two minor issues, though:<br />1) The lacing hooks near the top have become somewhat smashed, making it difficult to lace up the boots. (I typically just leave them laced and use the zipper, so it isn't that big a deal, but it is occasionally annoying)<br />2) The heel has worn down significantly, both the rubber and the wood, which is fairly soft. I've only had the boots for about two months, and the back side of both heels are about halfway gone. That said, I walk 3-4 miles a day, and wear these shoes 2-3+ times a week, so most people probably won't have this problem, at least not to the extent that I do. On the plus side, the boots are perfectly comfortable to wear for that kind of use!"
4.0,I love this bolero. It's perfect for a maxi dress I purchased months ago. Maybe it's supposed to fit this way but I felt like it was a little too small and because it takes forever to get here I didn't want to send it back.  It is very pretty and a dark black. Only thing I noticed was that you have to wash it on a gentle cycle before wearing. It started to turn my shirt black in the sweaty month of August!! ;) the way this bolero fit me at first was snug in the arms but stretched a bit and I just made sure it always covered my chest frequently. Would like to find one I wouldn't have to tug closed so much but can't beat the price and style. ;)
4.0,"I like it, just fits a little snug"
4.0,Exactly like described. I love Dasein bags...
4.0,new shoulder is not ready for much typing
4.0,I love this dress!!! The only reason for not 5 stars is that the zipper got stuck and separated from itself and I can't get it to move. I am returning the one with the broken zipper and ordering a new one. This dress fits amazing!!! Its a little tight around the neck but you can still function and move comfortably.
4.0,Well made. Saved me a ton vs the local dance store!
4.0,This product is made if good quality material. The sizing is as expected. A great deal.
4.0,They charms are smaller than expected but it is still a very cute bracelet.
4.0,Material much thinner than anticipated. Have to wear a full slip under so that you can't see through when material is stretched. Very comfortable and easy to wash.
4.0,"Hoped for a heavier shirt, but the price was right and the quality is excellent.  Really an excellent value. Very pleased overall."
4.0,Arms are short. Tie ripped in a few hours. It worked.
4.0,Just delivered....very prompt service. Good quality and a nice fit. I thought it was blue as pictured but I received a green one.
4.0,"So pretty, although smaller than I anticipated but Sooo worth it!! I would recommend for lil girl,or for extra ear hole since so small!! I loved their look though üòä"
4.0,"This is absolutely adorable.  I thought the colors and pattern were pretty in the pic but they are even more so in person.<br /><br />So, the fabric is thin.  Silky soft, but pretty thin.  This could be good or bad depending on your preferences or what you intend to wear this as.  Its very lowcut so I'm going to sew it up a tad in the bust area, also simply a personal preference.  The fabric had a couple of little pill looking snags on it but nothing noticeable unless you are really examining the dress.<br /><br />The sizes run small, so be sure to reference their size chart, not Amazons because you will be disappointed if you get it and it doesn't fit.  It's so pretty I wanted to wear it right away, luckily mine was only slightly small, but I tend to wear very flowy clothing anyway.<br /><br />This is a super thumbs up for anyone who may want an inexpensive dress that will be a lovely addition to a summer wardrobe.  I'm hoping to find it in other colors too because I like it so much.<br /><br />I received a discount on this dress and happily offer my honest opinion of the product in exchange."
4.0,"Another cute top from Allegra K. I own several tops of this brand and I found this one to fit a little more snug than the rest. It's not enough to stop me from wearing it though! Love the print and really like the longer hem in the back.<br /><br />Update: the printed panels are 100% rayon and, after first wash, will definitely need some light steaming to get it looking crisp again."
4.0,"Love the earrings, color and style - the post seems flimsy like it would fall off easily.  Otherwise a 5"
4.0,Great product exactly what I was looking for...good price
4.0,Love this cute little purse!  I gave it 4 stars because the material is green with gray beads.  I thought it would be gray fabric with gray beads.  I loved it though and did not return.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but too short for my wrist. It could  close but fit tightly. Take care to measure your wrist first.
4.0,"I love this dress. Multiple ways to wear it but the great thing is your can wear it anyway you may feel comtable with. I ordered the yellow one, it fit perfect & came with a great strech material. I am 5'4, 240 pounds wearing a size 15/16. I ordered a xxl & could have gotten away with a xl but didnt wantt to take the risk. Worth the buy!"
4.0,Everything was perfectly presented.  I was shocked. Beautiful packing
4.0,Very comfortable.  Love it. Will purchase again
4.0,The pants were a little loose in the waist(nothing my belt couldn't fix). I ordered my normal size 13 probably should've went with a size 11. Overall I loved them!
4.0,"I sized up because of another review showing short sleeves. Our sleeves are still short.<br /><br />Daughter is 5'6ish, 8th grade.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who can't sew, at least a little. One of the ears fell off almost immediately. They were barely tacked on, so we redid them both. Really though, these should have been put on with a button or a snap. The stitched on ears won't last long - probably not through the first washing, even after being fixed."
4.0,i have no complaints about this skirt. it fits great. I'm 5'2 164 and i brought a large. I'm very hippy and have a little gut. I'll try to insert a picture later.
4.0,It's cute but I was looking for something for work. It's a bit too fitted for that but I guess it depends on where you work. The quality of the dress is nice.
4.0,I got this for mother day and she love it .ben
4.0,Such a nice piece of jewelry. Not heavy at all I just hope it won't rust or anything. It shouldn't because it's stainless steel. Very happy.
4.0,"It's pretty and I love the fact that it's reversible, which wasn't advertised (bonus!). Unlike comments by other reviewers, the brim is plenty stiff to stay off my face. The main thing I dislike is the plastic clips on the chin strap are so stiff they render the chin strap unusable."
4.0,Really liked this dress! Was a little expensive considering the straps are like bra straps BUT great fit and quality otherwise. I got a medium and it was perfect !
4.0,QUALITY SWEATER FOR THE PRICE!
4.0,"I like the fit and the look of the shirt, it's *almost* a crop cut, but not quite. The only thing is that the cutouts make the fabric a little itchy, I am hoping that it will get softer after a couple more washes.<br /><br />I had a couple of people compliment me on it though."
4.0,This hat kept Jeff cool on a hot sunny day. It really does work well and was fun to wear!
4.0,"Cute. Keeping. A little short, in the torso."
4.0,Nice bathing suit but it's hard to get it up over your hips because the neck/back opening is too small.
4.0,needs front pocket
4.0,Nice belts works for me price was right
4.0,"It is very soft and comfortable.  However I have a narrow head.  Therefore it is a little larger than I would like.  It will blow off my head in a strong breeze.  Also, it is not tight against my ears so they can still get cold.  It is a good product, but if it had some adjustability it would be a better product.  I think it would be perfect for men or women with wider or larger heads."
4.0,I love my new slippers. They keep my feet warm and washed up nice.
4.0,"This is a pretty toe ring that is adjustable. It looks great, not too dainty and not too bulky. The finish is holding up so far. I am looking forward to the summer, so that I can ware it more often."
4.0,I love this dress. although it didn't hang off my shoulder as expected it was a good buy.
4.0,I don't notice these are any special socks.  They fit well and are a fun design though.
4.0,Nice bag but was missing tripod. So I knocked off a star
4.0,These are great but I bought L for me and ended up giving them to my daughter who is a small.
4.0,"An elegant design that looks great for the price. I get compliments from everyone on the chic knot design especially in black & white which isn't as common as most infinity silver rings. I've worn it everyday for almost 3 weeks, through work/date night/doing errands and chores around the house. Stones haven't fallen off yet and shows no sign of doing so after how much I've worn it and definitely didn't treat it delicately. Matches the image and product description.Fits true to size. Recommendation: to avoid the band from discoloring, make sure to clean it often and keep it dry (take it off when washing your hand or dry it immediately if it gets wet). I'd compare it to what you'd find at Nordstrom Rack, Dillards (department stores) or special boutiques. I'd recommend it for the great quality and price. Two of my friends have ordered it."
4.0,"I ordered this case because I wanted a simple case which holds more than 2 cards. And this is great!! This case is much thinner than my previous case for galaxy s8+, nice color, and fits well. It covers every corner but still enables to access the pen and buttons. I give 4 stars only because I can see glue points a little bit. But overall, I'm very satisfied with the quality and the price!!"
4.0,"I ordered a size up base don the other reviews and I'm glad I did. I would have normally tried on a Medium, but I ordered a large. I'm a size 4-6 normally. The top is a little looser than what I'd normally want and the shorts hug my thighs, but not in a bad way. It is very pretty. The fabric inside is pretty comfy, but i can feel some of the sequins on the legs, which is a little itchy."
4.0,Cute dress but runs small.
4.0,it was nice and very sexy
4.0,these are very pretty and look realistic but they do hurt after a while. the magnets are strong tho. i've been using the silver one for a while and the magnet hasn't been as strong and it is even looking like it's rusting or the paint is coming off.
4.0,"Took me awhile to put together, and to get my old band off.  But I did it and works and for great!"
4.0,"They‚Äôre a little big, I wear a size 11M I put on water socks first, fit was snug, but they stayed on fine."
4.0,"Loved the kit, they should put clear silicone o-rings. The black ones are not for people with sensitive ears. I got blisters."
4.0,I wear this with leggings and flats for a cute casual look.  A little too billowy to pull off as a dress with knee/thigh high boots........
4.0,I liked these: they were super lightweight and neutral in Color
4.0,The watch looks great! My only issue is that it seems a little small for a man's watch.
4.0,"First off I will say that the color is amazing. It is a deep red/burgundy and is very pretty. Now, the drawstring is basically useless because it has an elastic band which goes all the way around the waist, so I guess it's more for looks. For size reference I am normally a 14 (womens) or XL, based on other reviews I sized up to a 2XL and good thing I did because they fit perfect. I do prefer my clothes tighter fit and they are just that in the 2XL. There is plenty of stretch left over, but I doubt an XL, which is my normal size, would even go over my large thighs. Now, the reason for my 4 star review is actually more about quality. These are very thin material and there are strings hanging out everywhere. I realize I am not getting Nordstrom quality here, but I do expect these products to at least be finished. Overall I am happy with my purchase and will keep these, but I probably will not be ordering again."
4.0,"Its a nice dress, she felt comfortable in it and it was liked by many ladies around. Did not wash it yet , good looking ."
4.0,"i like the texture on this one and it clips on perf supertight even tryed pulling it off to make sure, one downside its a little long. fits on the 2nd hole leaving flap but its okay i just cut it works fine feels fine good buy, i do also like the color ,my was white which i thought was too flashy"
4.0,"great look, but the ""metal"" on the sides is warping a little."
4.0,"Shirt is frkn cute & the quality is amazing but it fits way to big! I ordered a medium/ I'm 5ft & approx. 135. The shirt drowned me, especially in the arm pits. I'm exchanging for a small & ordering other items from this manufacturer."
4.0,"The only leggings I want to wear! Love the fact that these have 2 side pockets, big enough for phones of all sizes. Love the fit, esp the high waist. Also, not see through, so that's a plus!  I<br />wear mine for running and at work. I just wish they restocked more often."
4.0,"The material is a little cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. Overall, I love it. My only problem is that it has 0 support on the chest area and being open in the back, a bra won't look good. But nothing some tape won't fix :) Feel very sexy in it"
4.0,Nice jacket. Runs a bit small.
4.0,"Good quality bag. Will be used for misc items like toiletries, supplies, etc. Would have preferred it to be a little bit larger, but still great for holding smaller items."
4.0,"This is a very nice labradorite piece, however its more of a guitar pick shape than a heart. Still a beautiful necklace, my daughter loved it."
4.0,"A hat with all these names is very suitable for those of us who want to be ivy league irish cabbie and newsboy hunters. Also, it's made of denim.<br /><br />Oh, I think they put these on their heads. Nice!!!!!"
4.0,Compliments to our Chakra bracelets
4.0,"The actual pendant seems to be of good quality.  The cord that it comes on is pretty cheap, and plasticky though."
4.0,Besides for it running a little small it's the same that you would by at Walmart for $10
4.0,"I love them. They are perfect for me. I am a size 7 women‚Äôs shoe.  At first they were a little tight, but after a wash and a wear, they are perfect. I love the socks with the grips on the bottom from the hospitals (ya I kept them from years ago lol) but they make my feet sweat. Not to mention they are super ugly lol Yoga socks, who knew. I wear them in place of slippers. Now, I‚Äôm not a yoga person, however, I think they would work.  The grip on the bottom works very well.  Plus they are adorable!"
4.0,Fits and allows me to s*** on the floor.
4.0,Great quality. Not easy to resize: note how the front edge of the belt sticks out of the buckle. When you cut it it won't have nice rounded corners. The alternative is to cut it short so that the edge is &#34;hidden&#34; behind the buckle but it doesn't look as nice because you see a big slot between 2 buckle plates...
4.0,This dress is very nice! It fits great. It has a see through appearance when holding it up but you are not able to see anything when you put it on. It is on the shorter side but still covers everything with your normal size.
4.0,"In general I like the gloves: color, fit.  But after only a couple of times wearing them there is little elastic threads poking out all over the fingertips which make the gloves look worn and shabby."
4.0,"Very pretty, will be great in my hair for my wedding."
4.0,"The pajamas were cute!  But, Unable to rate...bought as a gift."
4.0,Colors as not as bright as pictured.
4.0,Good quality material. Sturdy
4.0,Nice quality but does run small.
4.0,"Cute rings, and my daughter loves them but it will make your fingers green."
4.0,"This is a really nice see-through bag for those occasions/events that women are required to carry their items in a clear bag due to security reasons.  I had to do that last weekend when attending a football game.  This bag would have been great to have then but luckily I had another clear bag.  This one is much more purse-like and has a nice, smaller purse that goes inside it.  The clear plastic is good quality and durable and the mock snake skin looks really good.  The only thing I find a little bit of fault with is that this purse can't be completely closed.  It needs a snap or a Velcro patch to keep both sides of the bag very close together to prevent anyone reaching in and helping themselves to the contents.  Other than that I think it's a great clear purse."
4.0,"zipper is ""left handed"",nylon, not metal...lightweight material...just ""OK"""
4.0,"Love the look! Great color goes with a lot of different jewlery.  And leggings, great easy cool material for hot weather!"
4.0,"This is a pretty and dainty watch, nice to wear with a dress or evening and simple enought to wear to the office. Wish it was waterproof but for the price this is an excellant watch."
4.0,"My favorite part is the jacket tbh. The bodysuit itself isn't bad, it's short sleeved which is nice but as with all costumes in this material, you'll get sweaty. The ears it comes with kinda suck so I just used others I had. Other than that it's a simple costume"
4.0,Beautiful purse!  I like that it's not to big but big enough to carry extra stuff if need to. The only problem I have is it's a little heavy and doesn't hold its form if unzipped and use the shoulder strap.
4.0,nice looking belt; nice packaging
4.0,"The material is very soft. It is not that long down the sides, but long in the front and around the middle. I have decently big arms and they fit though the arm sleeves very well."
4.0,"I got this dress for the holidays as it's a beautiful deep green color, but it can also be worn year round. It can go either casual or fancy depending on how you accessorize, which I love. It's not quite as ""pleat-y"" as it looks in the stock photo but I don't mind. The wrap is very flattering and can work with many body types. I do feel the dress is a little expensive for a basic dress but that's just my opinion. Overall I'm happy with it."
4.0,"Cute bodysuit, would definitely suggest ordering a size up though, not for the fit of the top but for the bottom, it's just slightly too short. For reference I'm 5'3 113lbs and usually wear a small"
4.0,It cleans my jewelry good
4.0,It's nice nd comfortable
4.0,"I bought this adorable underskirt for my 27 year old daughter. She loves wearing vintage type dresses &amp; skirts and I thought this would be a nice piece to add to her wardrobe. The waistband in this skirt is so small...she is small and it fit her but she said not comfortably. Luckily I have granddaughters; 4 of which love to play dressup; so I'm always looking for pieces to add to their collection so it won't go to waste at least. The 3 yr old is obsessed with being a princess so you can just imagine how she paraded around in this! It‚Äôs a little big on her but nothing a safety pin couldn't fix. The under layer of the skirt is a nice soft white material with a couple of outer layers of tulle and lace. I love the stiffness of the tulle as it provides great fullness under her princess dresses but she says its scratchy. Even though it is on the stiffer side, it still has good movement I think and the fabric underneath provides comfort and protection from the tulle material. It's beautifully constructed and I would recommend it to smaller ladies or children over the age of 3 who want a little poof in their dress up or an accent for a formal affair as the crinoline really makes the mesh stand out. The Bridal Ballet Cos Lolita Hoopless Lace Short Crinoline Petticoats Slips Underskirt is very pretty and any little girl or petite woman would love it...but I think calling it a bridal accessory is a stretch.

4.0,"I am currently at 150 lbs after having my second baby and am 5'5 feet tall.  I ordered a size Medium and it fits great.  When I hear waist trainer or cincher,, something like this doesn't come to mind.. this product to me is more of a belt you would put on during workouts for additional support and to work your abs a little harder since they're tightened.  and BOY does this belt tighten!!  This belt grips on velcro, but its VERY strong velcro and holds very well.  I actually wore this to the gym and it provided really good support during weight lifting.  One thing i dislike about this belt is that it is not machine washable.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Soft material, but it is thinner. The bummer is the design is vinyl not screen print or a paint so the design makes much of the shirt stiff & bulky on the front. I still like it & will wear it. Just wish it wasn‚Äôt vinyl since it‚Äôs such a large design."
4.0,These swimming shorts are a little too large in the waist and upper hip; I could pay $20-25 to have them taken in but that would defeat the purpose of finding a bargain pair of swimming shorts to begin with!
4.0,"nice and comfort like the length, good for under gi (BJJ) but too thin for no-gi - very thin material almost transperent (especially the white)."
4.0,This was very soft but I did not keep it. The material's color was to see-through. I chose yellow as it showed to be bright and opaque on the photo. I may try another color some other time.
4.0,Large fits but I usually wear a medium so order a size larger...nice quality fabric and construction
4.0,"Cute, but they seem to be kind of cheaply made.  The stones look like they are just glued in place, and not securely."
4.0,Very cute however there is sponges over the boobs you can see. Looks bad. But it's very cute bathingsuit!!!! So I went and had alterations company take out foam sponges and insert another layer of fabric to make it not see through. Now my favorite suit.
4.0,my grandson liked them
4.0,"The look of the item is nice. The leather seems good quality and the metal polish on the edges is nice.<br /><br />My only issue is that those metal edges make the band feel a little small on my wrist. The original rubber fitbit band has enough flex where it contours over my wrist without any discomfort. Since this is a hard metal, it doesn't contour the wrist as comfortable. It puts some pressure on my wrist bone. Really noticeable at first but wasn't quite as bad the more I wore it."
4.0,It's great chain should be bigger
4.0,"I think that I foolishly expected them to have more structural integrity, but they are effective. I simply thought they would keep their dimensions more stiffly."
4.0,I purchased an XL to suit my hip area. Since I have a small upper body I had to alter the top part of the dress. Very suitable for work.
4.0,"softer than i expected, fits my head kind of weird but it does the job lol"
4.0,"This is listed as a choker with a 13 inch chain, but the chain is more like 18 inches. It's also not adjustable. To wear this necklace, I have to knot the chain in the back and hide it with my hair, which was impossible when I had a pixie cut."
4.0,I love my jumpsuit
4.0,the short was small than i expected but its ok
4.0,"Fun shirt, but it is really thin material, my son had to wear a shirt underneath. It is a great design and the colors are vibrant as pictured."
4.0,Just awesome and good fabric.... highly recommend with good deal
4.0,"The style of this dress is pretty and flattering. The material, however, is very cheap! The pattern is only on one side and the material feels very cheap and"
4.0,"I like these shoes a lot. I paid 20 dollars for them and I would order them again for 20 dollars. I noticed however that  the price has crept up to 30 dollars and I do not think that these are worth that much money because while they are very comfortable the quality is pretty low to mediocre. The material is painted black and the black comes of in weird patches exposing the white underneath (make the shoe look really cheap and sloppy) also the insole started coming out in one of the shoes when I take it off, and the sole is wearing out pretty fast (I use these only to jog on the treadmill for maybe 1 hr 5 times a week for a month and I can tell they will probably only last 1 more month). I would pay 20 bucks or less for these shoes and buy a new pair every couple months but I will not do that if they are going to charge more than 25ish dollars."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:8a31c7916b6cacb95e1a1c5d19c6f550]] Soft comfortable band.<br />Band slips out of the black piece easy.<br />The one thing I would change is to turn the design around because it is upside down.
4.0,"My daughter is in band and I bought this after a couple cases of football practice and band camp overlapping. She loved it and wore it the very next day. After several washes it still looks good. Its sized more like junior tees than ladies, so keep that in mind."
4.0,"The white tops seam to be thinner in fabric. decided to buy a second because I don't think it will be holding up to too many washes, sorry!"
4.0,"I usually wear a 30H in American brands and a 32H if possible with Wacoal bras. This bra is very supportive and provides a lot of coverage, fits well and surprisingly the straps are SLIGHTLY stretchy and thin but still sturdy and comfortable. I only wish the wire were thinner and more flexible - it's very thick and makes it uncomfortable and stiff - otherwise it's great."
4.0,"Great product!  I was buying this as a replacement for one I lost.  Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they don't have a way to select hat size here, so the replacement I got was way too big."
4.0,"It was a very cute dress.  Fits a lil bigger than expected.  Had to send back for a smaller size.  But great material all in all.  When I get the small I needed, it will be perfect!"
4.0,"Gloria Vanderbilt jeans fit me perfectly except being about half an inch too big in the waist.  I generally add a second button to compensate.  The fabric is good quality with a tiny bit of stretch added.  These pants are dressier than jeans, and apparently the designer feels that dressy pants don't need pockets.  The odd shaped pockets in the front are hard to get things in or out of.  The rear pockets turned out to be a joke.  After removing the stitches so I could stow a credit card in one, I found they weren't even deep enough for that.  I am old and can carry a purse, but I have noticed young people often carry a phone in a hip pocket so be warned.  I love the fit, but I took off a star for the pockets.  I will always choose Gloria Vanderbilt because they are female shaped, bu I could asked for better pockets."
4.0,The material is very light and slightly see through.
4.0,These ear rings were a little too big for my taste. I did give them to my girlfriend and she enjoys them. Fast delivery and curtious service.
4.0,"Product came 2 days early, I thought that, when buying this bag that I was going to carry around less stuff from my other bag, but everything fit. I needed this ."
4.0,These compression shirts work pretty well. Do a good job of wicking to keep me dry. I am happy with them.
4.0,"I ordered this for my badge at work.  It works great, has room for my bus card and debit card and is very stylish.  I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"may be a hoax, but the idea is really good..."
4.0,Very nice and fits as expected in the top portion of the dress but the skirt fits a little looser than expected. But overall it works!
4.0,love them very pretty and festive
4.0,"The actual pendan is lovely, it's made of a nice silver, it also has really nice details, but I dont think the chain is real silver, that would be my only complaint<br />Delivery was very fast too."
4.0,"Would give 5 stars, but inside zipper died within 1 week of getting this. Not a big issue for me, still use it.<br />For the price, a great deal, leather nicer than I expected, beautiful color."
4.0,Runs way too small. I got it 2x my size & it still was way too small. An XL fits like a small!
4.0,I really like this it can be a little tricky to store the necklace in a jewelry box.
4.0,Definitely a solid purchase. Recently did an 80 mile ride for charity and this was my first time wearing actual biking gear. Everything fit as advertised. I am a pretty big guy especially in the thighs and I thought the large was perfect.
4.0,Bought it for 12 year nephew. Likes it but latch is hard for him to do
4.0,Somewhat larger than expected. Had to send first suit back for a smaller one. Fit much better. Flattering suit.
4.0,"Soft, breathable. Wore them on a 12 mile hike"
4.0,"The fit was good and the color was beautiful but the fabric was much thinner than I expected and showed too many bumps/ripples for my liking, though I typically wear thicker compression leggings so maybe I'm just used to that and the smoothing effect those have... Still 4 stars because they are great quality leggings, just didn't work for me."
4.0,"Great clip on sunglasses, light weight and tinted just the way I prefer.. good value for the money."
4.0,Worked immediately...only need one for right leg...too new for further comment.
4.0,I was actually impressed with the fabric. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it is. Fits nicely perfect length. Can be dressed up or down
4.0,Not sure why they class this as a masonic ring.  Its the Romanov coat of arms.
4.0,Great shirt. Love the quality but seems to run a little small
4.0,"This minimalist leather card holder is certainly compact, with slots for a driver's license and a few cards, along with a very small zip pocket where you might stash a few coins or a folded bill or two. It's not really useful for currency beyond that, but does work for those times when you'd rather slip a few things into a front pocket or you're carrying a small clutch rather than a larger bag. Well constructed, but I'd prefer something with a small money clip attached for bills. It is, however, as advertised."
4.0,No frills basic flip flop. The reason these did not get 5 stars is when I put these on with my bug spray the color from the flops runs on my skin. In 10 years of using the same bug spray and method of applying this is the only thing that has ever had the color come off on to my skin.
4.0,"Wonderful and good quality , my sister so excited when shewearing it ."
4.0,Awesome! I used for my cruella deville disneybound. I didn't use the jewel. It does run a little small so I had to wear it higher up.
4.0,I like this mask but had to sew the ear loops because they were too large.
4.0,Loved the ease with which these stockings went on. They are comfortable and precisely what was needed.
4.0,"I like them, but I thought they would be thicker."
4.0,Love this shirt. It is comfortable and I love the v neck
4.0,Really cute & super comfy. I got size large & wish I would have sized up for a baggier fit. (I have large thighs!) The quality is not the best. You can see in the picture that I attached little beads forming on the pockets. I haven‚Äôt been drying them. Probably worn 10 times & have gotten several compliments.
4.0,Grandson loves the shirt however too large so he will return for smaller size.
4.0,"I am not always fond of paper bag pants but this pair made me want to try.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />This is a pretty sturdy thick denim that has little stretch to it.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style of these is nice for relaxing jeans.  They are not sports pants.  They are style jeans.  The belt is awful and looks silly unless you are a size 1 wearing these pants 2 sizes up and want to accentuate the paper bag look.  The ankles can be annoying in the cold or with low shoes as they do tend to ride up when you sit and you have to pull them down.  The side pocket on the leg is also meh, but not bad.<br /><br />FIT<br />I wear a size 14-16 misses US and got the 2XL.  It fits perfectly for relaxing pants with plenty of room in them.  I find that wearing boots with these is better than low shoes in colder weather.  In warmer weather, it does not matter.<br /><br />ANKLES<br />If you prefer not to have elastic ankles, it is easy enough to remove the elastic and have the legs be plain.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These pants are nice.  They are comfortable and easy to wear.  I am not fond of the belt.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I like these.  They are cute, but not WOW.  They are comfortable and I wear them casually, but they are not quite as flattering as other jeans I have."
4.0,The wallet has a strange smell to it when first opened after letting it sit out a few days it was fine though. The wallet doesn't feel very durable but it is cute and good quality for the price. It comes with a storage bag which is nice for when I put it away
4.0,"They say that makes you look skinner but that's not true, actually is not a sexy coat but its warm."
4.0,"I did have to repair a seam near the zipper, but other than that it's a great dress. I have gotten many compliments on it"
4.0,"The jacket it's perfect fit, I like the color deep blue."
4.0,A lot bigger than I thought it would be but i'll fit in it eventually
4.0,Love this bold necklace. The only thing that could be changed is its weight. It is pretty heavy when it is around your neck
4.0,"Nice, seems solid."
4.0,"The chain was packaged well, (bubblet wrap envelope) and cane in a nice gift box. It's a very nice chain but when I opened it the rubber part was off. I fixed it with my needle nose tool, but the idea to get something like that new and have to fix it is not good even though it wasn't a big fix."
4.0,"This is a good raincoat, I like it cause you can still see what your kid is wearing.  The hood is adorable too."
4.0,it okay.
4.0,Material was a bit cheaper than expected but overall it looks great!
4.0,It fit just like it was supposed to i washed it and it kept it's color.I have a hard time buying clothes online was very happy with it. Recieved at a discount for my opinion.
4.0,Love the color and style. Not crazy about back zipper. I'm afraid it will get caught zipping up and down. I got the purple one. It will be a fun dress for Spring.
4.0,"this product overall is great. I have a bunch of facial jewelry that I needed to replace, ans these can right on time.<br />the only issue I had with these was that my lip ring became so stuck on the tread that I couldn't untwist it. it was super stuck so we used industrial wire cutters to cut it in half. bit everything else is great and amazing for the price. no fake metal reactions. all the other treads are great!"
4.0,"Very good bag. For my own uses it has plenty of space and easy zip pockets. One on the inside, out side there are two; one on top and the other to the back. The extra pocket on the side and the front are magnetized. It has nice ""rings"" to be able to clamp keys to.<br />The only problem I've had with this bag is that the belt like closer with the magnet part fell off. The belt part is not very well secured, they should have stitched it on. I have to carry many things daily on my back and lugging things in my arms. To be able to throw this over my shoulder and it not sliding off as I'm doing things, is very helpful.<br />It shows online that you can put your Macbook air laptop in it, which I was excited about... but it might only hold the macbook air mini laptop. It's too small for mine."
4.0,"Ladies, this is a tube top made from stretchy lace, I use it as a shirt extender.  It makes an awesome shirt extender. I am a size 18W and it gives enough to lay nicely on my hips."
4.0,"2xl, fits good, can wear a sweater under it, looks good, and it's surprisingly warm, got a lot of compliments, only down size to this coat are the ""pleather"" sleeves, you get what you pay for"
4.0,Bought for a friend.
4.0,Very nice suit for this low a price. Good alternative to renting for my son's high school formal. Make sure you order 1 size up from what you wear for the jacket if you have broad shoulders.
4.0,Very flattering to the curves!!! Fit as expected.  Wish I would have purchased the white and black tho.
4.0,Brought this for my sister she loves it so much.
4.0,"Soft and comfy, but the sleeves are short."
4.0,It compresses but not to much to make it uncomfortable.
4.0,the dress is very pretty but runs a little smaller than I thought it would.
4.0,Cute dress at a good price.
4.0,"As a top heavy girl, 36 DDD these were a great fit to workout with no stress about my boobs"
4.0,These were bought for my wife and were a good fit for all different types of piercings! Good buy!
4.0,fit need on the Beach
4.0,"For a sweatshirt, this is on the thin side. Material isn't as thick or fuzzy on the inside like a typical sweatshirt. Otherwise, my husband likes everything about this. He's required to wear safety gear like this for work. I ordered this in a 3xl so he can wear this over another shirt on cooler days and not feel constricted. He's 6'5"", so the sleeves are a little short when he stretches his arms out. Lengthwise, this falls just below his waist. The shirt launders well and as long as stains are pre-treated, they haven't stuck to the fabric. I usually dry everything on medium heat, so there's been no shrinkage of the shirt. Hasn't pilled up either, where the arms rub against the sides or along the cuffs. Reflective quality is excellent after dark. Nice shirt, especially for those who dislike wearing nylon safety vests over their clothing."
4.0,First let me say the dress is cute but not exactly what I expected. For some reason I thought the fabric would be softer; though that's neither here nor there. It fits a bit large and is super long. I thought about just cutting it off but had this marvelous idea. I took it to a seamstress and had the hem done hi-low. It's gorgeous!!!üòç I'm going to rock a chunky statement necklace with it and some cute sandals.
4.0,"My daughter is wearing a 9 now in regular shoes. We initially bought the medium, but found these to be better overall. With the strap, it really doesn't matter that they are big and she'll get some wear out of them for a few years. She always wants to wear shoes to complete her princess outfits (she even puts on her sneakers), but these are great. The plastic slides that are available are so dangerous and really cut into her skin. So glad we found these!"
4.0,"I purchased this coat for my wife as a fall coat. Upon opening she loved what she saw. The coat is constructed of sturdy material and very well constructed. The flared bottom provides a comfort fit, while the overall fit is good the sleeves are a little tight and a little restrictive if you do not fit into the ideal body size category. I would defiantly say that this is a product that is worth the investment in. My wife is satisfied with the overall quality design and fit as a whole.<br /><br />I also want to add that I was able to purchase this item at a discount in return for a fair, honest, and unbiased review of the product.<br /> The opinion above is strictly my own, and I was in no way influenced by Amazon or the seller.<br />I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."
4.0,Such a cute bracelet! And such a great price! Really glad I purchased!!
4.0,"A little tight around the calf in an odd way, but still great!"
4.0,Not as big as I expected to be
4.0,"The fit is a little snug, but overall I like this product."
4.0,"These are good gloves. I don't notice that much of a difference with Aloe lining the inside but I don't have a latex allergy anyway. Like all COVID-related products (hand sanitizer, gloves, face mask etc.) these are a bit overpriced but that is simply the result of supply and demand. The company was prompt in responding to inquiries, too. Overall, I recommend the product and the vendor."
4.0,Like the design a lot and the material is lightweight.
4.0,Good value for price for sure
4.0,"Nice for the money, size is also nice."
4.0,"Just opened my package and unfortunately it is ""incomplete"". One of the ""frame holders"" is missing; the right one specifically.<br />Im not a bad review person so ill leave it in 3 stars because it is easy to fix and I like the frames. Even though it says ""supportive demo lenses"" it is able to put your own prescription since the frames are flexible and strong enough to do so."
4.0,I bought this for my son's birthday.  He usually wears a large and this sweater was a bit large in the size Large.My son liked it that way. You may want to purchase it in a size smaller then you normally wear.
4.0,The design is Awesome! It just fits a little too snug for me. I get compliments everytime I wear it. It‚Äôs a big upgrade from the last Darth Vader mask I got. I should have ordered two!
4.0,Beautiful. You may need a great foundation
4.0,"The three shorter chokers are super cute I get complimented every time I wear. They are pretty cheaply made, but they also are very low price so I'm not complaining. The longer bow one came very kinked and it doesn't look very good so I have not worn it yet."
4.0,Love the style. The colors are so slightly lighter than the photos on line. But it‚Äôs a nice look with jeans or joggers
4.0,"One of the little side lenses popped out the first time I wore it. Still, they tend to work fine and I don't have to squint as much while driving. They only barely fit over my glasses but at least they fit ... even if they do sit a little bit heavy on my nose."
4.0,It's very cute and a great length but the elastic waistband is a bit tight and folds up inside the waist bit.
4.0,Very cheap fabric but cute!
4.0,Want a robe that wiuld pack well.
4.0,This bag is very small but great for a small child
4.0,"This scarf fell apart very quickly, even in a gentle wash. But it looks pretty cool even while strings are hanging out and holes are evident."
4.0,"Purchased in the exact same size that my husband always wears and yet there is space in the front and the back that causes the shoe to slip. Sizing down would just make them tight so we‚Äôre probably going to stick with these. They look nice and probably can‚Äôt handle too much streetwear, but they‚Äôre good for looking nice  in a pinch."
4.0,"I live in the coldest city in North America, so I'm always checking out new cold weather gear.  I've been looking for the perfect glove for zero to -40 and while these aren't it, I'm actually quite pleased with the pair.<br /><br />These are some thick gloves, lots of insulation and comfortable to wear.  The heavy insulation does slightly limit articulation, especially at the fingertips, but that's usually expected.  These do a good job down when sustained to about -20 or so, but beyond that, it's difficult for your hands to generate enough heat to maintain what you'd call ""warmth.""  At really cold temps, below -20, it seems that only a pair of high quality mittens are sufficient for these temperatures.  For the coldest of days, my go to is a pair of Black Diamond Mercury mittens which I've personally tested down to 52 below.  For short periods, like a drive to work, these gloves will work fine even to -40F though.<br /><br />What does impress me, though, is that I see roughly similar performance to a very high quality, $150+ pair of cold weather guide gloves.  That's spectacular for the cost of these things.  While I prefer those guide gloves for hard work out in the bitter cold, these are great for every day use when I don't need heavy use of my hands.  I've used these gloves to rock my snowthrower through -20F for more than an hour, more than once.  It's not comfortable,  but I can get through what I need to and that's a difficult application to build any technical gear for.  For the value, these are pretty good for some non-brand name gloves.<br /><br />Edit:  There's a lot more reviews for these gloves these days.  My positive review in an extreme environment probably helped influence that.  It's apparent that there are different tolerance levels to cold.  These gloves don't have built in heaters, your hands are not going to be 68F degrees even at barely freezing temperatures.  I think of these gloves as a measure of protection against the alternative, frostbite.  Cold isn't comfortable.  The temperatures where some people are having trouble with these gloves are where I begin to think about putting a long sleeve shirt on.  If you're not a cold weather person, you should probably consider battery heated gloves or better yet, HotHands glove inserts.  When I talk about going an hour+ at a snowthrower below negative 20...it's a given that I'm using HotHands inserts.  You may still need to outfit for your specific conditions."
4.0,Did not completely clean my Air Force Flyknits. Actually made them darker (since they were white/white). Have to find how to make the white color pop. Haven't had to use on another shoe yet.
4.0,This belt fits as expected. Look exactly the same as the picture. I definitely would like to purchase other styles.
4.0,seemless it is!  nylon helps not stick to my dresses also!<br /><br />overall - it's very comfortable and the nuetral color helps with a versatile closet!
4.0,They fit a bit big the quality was okay but it is thin so I‚Äôd recommend putting a mask underneath for extra protection
4.0,"Gloves work like they should. Some stiching is not sown in correctly, but I'll reinforce the parts that mess up."
4.0,"Very pretty design. For me, the ear 'wires' are very thick. I am in my late 50s and my ear piercings are too small for these things."
4.0,It is hard to get fitbit out to charge but otherwise it's perfect.
4.0,"Purchased for 16 year old son, 5‚Äô10‚Äù and about 165 lbs. Jacket is a tad larger than need be, but does do nicely with a hoody under. Kid loves it, looks just like all the other kids wearing the same style of jacket."
4.0,"Be patient...took a while to arrive, but worth the wait."
4.0,"Nice for the price, if the initial was just slightly smaller it would be 5 stars, but otherwise, nice design and quality!!!"
4.0,These do not fit my average size 2.5yo.
4.0,"This nostalgic inspired tee-shirt is perfect. It is heather blue/navy with the slogan (with the popsicle logo) reminiscent of my childhood - ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs popsicle ‚Äì It‚Äôs possible.‚Äù It seems to run a little small, so definitely order up, especially if you aren‚Äôt going to be careful when you wash it.  But wearing it reminds you of a hot summer day, hearing the bell ringing while waiting for the ice cream truck to stop."
4.0,Super light weight polyester - well designed and holds up - My son loves it. We live in the northern states so his mom wanted warmer but it was more important he liked it.
4.0,It is what I expected. Fits well.
4.0,This is a nice soft material. Bf usually wears XXL. It was too loose. For a better fit had to reorder one size down XL.
4.0,"They are pretty small but nice tumbled, cut and polished. They actually look like tumbled Mexican onyx-the type they make chess pieces with. But I examined them very carefully and here and there is some of the blue/pink/rainbow flash that everyone wants in these stones. There is hardly any of that going on. If you are like me and make jewelry this probably isn't you best option. As the saying goes, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. However if you are also like me and do crystal work, these will be good for grids. I have them soaking right now and then I will charge them. I'm hoping they have some good energy. Listen there is a guy up the road from me that has a rather large crystal shop and I know that he would have charged me $10 for two of these. So they really are a good deal. Shipping was EXTREMELY fast coming from China. I ordered these from an individual vendor not Amazon. So for grid work or just some pretty stones these are great. They included a cute little red bracelet as a thank you gift. It's really nothing special, but I thought it was a very nice touch. I will definately be a repeat customer. Good job!"
4.0,These are great pants for the price but they have zero compression. They are soft and very high waisted.
4.0,"These are great Lululemon knockoffs. Super soft, length is good, waist height is on point. The fabric is great even for a white cat owner, and hasn‚Äôt pilled. I got the coral color and they are a little see-thru if you wear dark underwear which is why I gave 4 stars. But for $25 that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd expect. Would definitely buy another pair and recommend to others."
4.0,"The dress is cute, the quality is not all that great. The Faces are kind of blurry and the material is not very good, but for $13.99 its fine."
4.0,It looks like a normal piece of paper until you tell people about it. It's really cool and durable.  But cards don't really sit too well in it; they slide around a bit.
4.0,"The leather is so soft, I'm not really sure if that's a good or bad thing. I AM sure that I love this belt"
4.0,I would buy again; it's a cute top and it fits nicely.
4.0,Nice quality. Just not exactly what I wanted. Gave it to my daughter
4.0,"These are perfect for a costume but run big. If you‚Äôre slim or have very thin legs, these may not stay up on you. They have elastic at the top and will stay if you have average legs. Double sided tape may be the answer for anyone with super slim legs above the knee. Also know that if you‚Äôre short- (5‚Äô1-5‚Äô3), these can comfortably go up past your mid thigh and be worn as regular stockings‚Ä¶they‚Äôre long, and this would be without stretching them thin.  The bow on one came in the mail already loose and wouldn‚Äôt stay the right way.  Overall good for a costume."
4.0,Lifetime warranty and excellent pocket size umbrella.
4.0,I hope I get a refund since I live in Honduras and payed to have it shipped<br />To my country so I cannot<br />Return it.
4.0,Great dress!  Well made. Zipper sticks a bit so watch that. The middle has s piece that‚Äôs see through and the top lace is see through but other than that the dress is great. My daughter is a ladies large and we bought a xxl
4.0,"Cute and easy to wear. Love the extra long sleeves! Fabric is a little thinner than I had hoped, (not great for warmth) but ok. Great piece for layering!"
4.0,Don't know why I was thinking it might have been a little more better. But it still can do
4.0,Solid sunglasses with nice lenses. Two pair were a little too flashy for my style but the others are great.
4.0,I love these earrings! If I could find them in real gold I would purchase them. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on them and wish they were available to grab some more!
4.0,Its warm nice material but doesn't stay on your body very nice like of unfit  is doesn't look very fit in the front
4.0,"For as expected, was super comfortable. Just came wrinkled, but after steaming it it was fine and the belt was a little flimsy. Wore to a wedding, was perfect for the occasion. Can't wait to wear it to another event!"
4.0,"Got these socks instead of paying full price for injinji‚Äôs ... they‚Äôre definitely comparable. Only downside is I can feel the weave of the fabric under my foot as I run, which is kind of irritating - I think I may have gotten a pre- blister from them; that‚Äôs a bummer so I won‚Äôt be wearing them for a race distance again. (Comfort gets a 4/5)<br />Durability- 4/5 - They definitely aren‚Äôt as soft or high-quality as Injinji, but for short, easy runs, they work well and are comfortable enough - so I can save my Injinji‚Äôs for race day or long runs when i need the extra quality.<br />Fit - 5/5 - The toe-length is average. I could see how they‚Äôd be to long for shorter toes and too short for longer toes, but it would be hard to make a sock that fits exactly perfect for each unique foot.<br />Value for money - 5/5 - Definitely worth their price for having a few ‚Äútraining‚Äù pairs and save the pricier socks for performance days. Definitely recommend as an alternative to brand names to keep your sock-costs down, but I think I‚Äôd have at least a pair or two of brand names in my stash as well if you‚Äôre a serious runner."
4.0,"I really like it, tho it‚Äôs a compressed shirt (considered a ‚ÄúNo Gi‚Äù if your looking for one for jujutsu) so expect it to be reeeeeaaaallly tight. I would definitely recommend sizing up a bit. I ordered large and I usually wear medium, still tight a little."
4.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it since she use to be in band. Only thing to keep in mind is that this thing is very small and smaller than the typical Pandora charms... at least from what I can see
4.0,4 star
4.0,Comfortable it is kinda heavy and thick and I thought it would have a wire at the top by the nose but other then that for the price and everything it met my expectations I wish it had the metal nose holder for more protection.
4.0,Good hat for what it is.
4.0,I love the tanks.  I feel like they have good quality.  They run a little small for a bustier woman.  Was hoping for just a little more length.
4.0,Could have been a bit larger but nice
4.0,Love the style and pattern.
4.0,"Nice terry, not too heavy, washes up nicely.  Only drawback is that the neck is WAY TOO BIG.  Perfect for obese individual or someone with a neck brace, but not a frail elderly person.  Do wish there was more velcro or, better yet, snaps in multiple locations.  Decent value for the money."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  It's very comfortable and great to slip into at home.  It is rather long and I may shorten it but will see how it fits after it's washed. The ad said it was cotton with a bit of spandex, but it is polyester.  Not a bad thing as it won't require as much ironing."
4.0,It can be worn with the side slit on either side.
4.0,Lower heel
4.0,"a little bit small for me, but it is comfortable when I wear it to do sports. it is a good deal and I will come to buy a size M next time"
4.0,I really like the style of the dress and the material is light weight and easy to care for. My issue is the split. Ladies who are more lovely around the butt and thighs the split is really too revealing.<br /><br />I received a discount for my review of the dress
4.0,"I like the look of the band.  It looks good on my wrist, much better than the rubber/plastic band."
4.0,I wear an XL T-shirt 99% of the time. This T-shirt was the 1%'er.  I would have given 5 stars if it fit right - the shirt is soft and comfortable .
4.0,It's adorable & comfortable.  In search now for the perfect top to wear with it.
4.0,This is very cute and will be added to a charm bracelet.  It is good quality and even comes with a polishing cloth.
4.0,Its kind of tight across the chest. I had to send a few of them back until I got the right. They run small
4.0,"Really cute n comfy. Fits loose and flowy. Fabric is thin and cool. Great for San Diego weather!  Like that the straps are adjustable and the pockets. It is somewhat cheaply made with 2 panels sewn together n the seam down the middle but for what it costs,  im happy."
4.0,True to size for my 10 year old son
4.0,Great for securing a sweater for over the shoulders look or those with no buttons.
4.0,It's a bit misleading but a colorful sack that collapses/folds back to original size.
4.0,"This product is awesome. It‚Äôs a little big for my head, but I can make it work! I was a little<br />Bummed the pony tail was a low one and not a high one, but either way it‚Äôs better than none. Good quality. Seems pretty warm. It‚Äôs not fleece lined but double lined which works."
4.0,"Love this skirt.  Great addition to my wardrobe.  Well made, nice fabric for the price."
4.0,Its cute and not too tight on my head
4.0,The dress is really cute and very soft for lace! My only drawback is it is see through
4.0,"Bought an XL because of everyones comments. Should‚Äôve went with the L. Fits loose around the waist which is the only complaint I have. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 205lbs with a muscular build. Was a little iffy bedore ordering because of jersey like material but after wearing it in the gym, I‚Äôd definitely buy it again."
4.0,These boots are true to size and true to color.
4.0,My mother in law loved this!  Great gift!
4.0,"For the price, these are great joggers! For reference, I am 6‚Äô0 and 185lbs with an athletic build. I generally wear a size 32 waist in pants. I purchased a large and after washing and drying the first time, they fit perfect! I would also like to note that I like my joggers a little on the shorter side; so do not dry these if you want them longer. They do shrink quite a bit."
4.0,Colorful and very durable fabric.
4.0,"My daughter wanted something with a kitty on it for her soon-to-be son, but everything with kittens was for girls. This is a very cute way to use a kitten for a boy's outfit. The quality seems to be very good. As recommended I ordered a size bigger than needed; however, it is really small. I ordered the six-month size, and the outfit is about the size for a newborn. I don't know if it will shrink. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the size runs so small."
4.0,"Bought this for my niece who absolutely loved it. The sellers were great as well, and when I experienced a problem with the order they quickly corrected it."
4.0,I'm not so sure.  The dress is not horrible but the fabric isn't all that nice.  It's a bit rough but sturdy and will hold up to washings.
4.0,I didnt got what I expected<br />Two shorts came in good conditions and fits perfect thw other two are to small and kne of them had a hole üò´
4.0,"Ok, so they're sold for age 3-6 years, but they were first sold to us for our 19 month-old at the ophthalmologists office. While we love the glasses for what they are, they were chronically too big and would either slide off our daughter's nose, or look like airplane goggles when we tightened them up extra. Several weeks in, we discovered these: [[ASIN:B01FZZ0UHM douper Anti-slip Eyeglass Strap & Ear Lock Hook Kit for Kids Soft Silica Gel Material Random Color Pack of 4]], and our problems were solved. The ear pieces make the frames fit perfectly, and now we enjoy the frames, knowing they've got a lot of room for growth."
4.0,"I'll be honest, at first I had mixed feelings about the fabric of these pants since they felt kind of like a plasticky version of some type of athletic fabric but considering how inexpensive they were I figured it wasn't worth returning them. Now that I've had them for a while now, I'm actually surprised by how much I like them. Yes, technically I would prefer a higher quality fabric but I'm also realistic enough to realize that you get what you pay for and the amount that I paid (less than $10) was not enough to expect a super high quality product. So in that sense, it's a pretty good deal.<br /><br />The sizing was good, I ordered a XXL and I'm typically a size 16-18 and they fit very comfortably, almost a little baggy even. Especially as a bottom-heavy/curvy woman, I really appreciate that these aren't super tight on my hips or thighs. At 5'2 these are a bit long for me, but then again I have that problem with all of my pants so not exactly a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />I won't be wearing these to the store or anything like that but for a decent pair of lounge pants, they're comfy, fit well and they even have pockets so I'll probably end up ordering a second pair at some point. Would recommend, just don't expect designer quality because that's not what you're paying for."
4.0,"They fit great, worked great.  I am only 5'7 though, so not sure how they would work with someone larger."
4.0,"I like most everything about this; however, the neck opening is a  bit too tight. It goes over the head okay, but I kept pulling at it all day when I first wore it. I am going to put my sewing skills to use and open the neckline up a bit."
4.0,"These were nice slippers but ran small. My husband wears an 11 shoe... I ordered a 12 based on reviews... too narrow and toes were at top .. nice, but had to return, order larger!!"
4.0,"It was very big for me.. But it's a nice red color, not so bold more like an italian red"
4.0,"[[ASIN:B002HU27UW Grid-It Organizer, Black (CPG10BK)]]<br /><br />I just bought this organizer to use in my fjallraven kanken backpack (which doesnt have many storage compartments).  It is perfect for organizing smaller things that would be sitting on the bottom of my bag otherwise.  I use it for pens, erasers, calculator, and other misc items for class.  The only advice i would give is to check the size that you want, as this one is a bit small.  Otherwise, a great product!"
4.0,"I'll list positives and negatives:<br /><br />Positives: It's been 3 weeks and they haven't changed colors or tarnished at all and the stones are still clear. The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Negatives:  These are so big for my taste that there's only three sizes I can wear out of the set of 6.. The others way too big. The post bends too easily on some and there slightly irritating and not so realistic .<br /><br />I normally purchase a 3 set of Sterling from Wal-Mart online for $9.99 sale. It has a small, medium and large for my three ear holes on each side. The size is perfect and very realistic looking and not irritating. I thought these looked kind of cheap. I have been buying the others for two years and the price has been the same. If I lose one I but another set. They retail higher but always on sale. But you have to buy online and unless you buy $50 worth you have to pay shipping through Walmart so I thought I would try these this time.<br /><br /> For the price they aren't too bad but I was expecting them to be similar to my others. I'm giving it 4 stars because the seller refunded my purchase so I'm not out of money and I feel that's respectable.  It comes in a little velvet type gift bag so the packaging is cute."
4.0,a little hard to put on but it is very cute.
4.0,It was pretty for a wedding i went to.
4.0,These were too large even though i ordered my normal size. Company was gracious with good followup. This was a darling shoe but did it did not work for me.
4.0,"I love my pajama jeans, but was disappointed when these developed a hole in the seat after being worn only one time. I took them to the tailor, who was able to fix them, but still."
4.0,"The fit of the top is as to be expected in every way EXCEPT the length. It‚Äôs a little on the short side. We even ordered a couple sizes up as my daughter wanted it to be baggy, and when she lifts her arms, you can see her belly button (she‚Äôs 11, petite but average height & build) it also did the same to her friend who got her exact size. The material is very soft, thick & comfortable though! My daughter still loves it and wears it often! All in all a beautiful top, warm, decently thick & very soft, and fits as expected as as chest, abdomen & arms go. Just a little short in the midsection area."
4.0,Fits big and the belt is way too big but good for the price
4.0,This is a very attractive watch it looks really good cheap but it looks nice
4.0,The are so cute. I love the shape .perfect for my project. Thanks Amazon.
4.0,Product was a little short but seller provided a quick resolution. Their Customer service was awesome.
4.0,Fits good. I'm a 36d. Highly recommend.
4.0,Like this skirt. It‚Äôs a little biggish but fun.
4.0,Very sexy! And I love the velvet makes it look expensive
4.0,good quality ball cap
4.0,Love these jeans. They should make them a little longer
4.0,I'm a thick legged girl but these fit beautifully. I did have to repair the heel 6 months in but it's been years and they are still going strong. Would buy 3 more if they ever come back in stock
4.0,It ran a little too short for my son.
4.0,They were easy to put on the light feature and look nice.
4.0,"A bit wide for my liking but the fit isn‚Äôt bad I suppose. The buttons on the other hand clink even when buttoned, pretty annoying but bearable."
4.0,My 1 year old's foot is tiny.  These run really big in my opinion.  We ordered a 6-12 months and her foot only takes up about 2/3 of the boot. LOL They are super cute though and I like the grip on the bottom. Returning the larger size for the smaller ones.
4.0,Really nice and stylish but the arms where there's elastic is slightly tight.
4.0,"Beautiful ring. I would recommend to others. Also, fast delivery from seller."
4.0,Top has nice v-neck line. Ordered xl but still too small for my chest DD cup. Also the cut under arms is low. Good top for small chested girls no biger than C cup .
4.0,I bought a bigger size to tailor to my odd body shape. The fabric and material is very nice! I had to tack down the collar to keep it from moving around but otherwise it is a nice dress!
4.0,"Other then it fitting on the larger side, its comfy."
4.0,Color is dull. I like the way it fits. Just wore once for an hour. Can not comment too cub on it.
4.0,I needed some yellow gold stud earrings and these fit the bill.  They are a nice believable size and how can you beat the price.<br />They are comfortable and the back is substantial in size so the earring does not tip forward.  The price was perfect.
4.0,"A little small, but will work for price."
4.0,Its beautiful but my husband is a working man and so the paint has worn off and its now mostly white.
4.0,No stretch at all. Very tight. Having a tough time getting the cards out of my wallet.
4.0,Very cute. Runs one size too large.
4.0,Very cute and COMFY shirt. The only problem I had with it is the strings are waaaaay too long. They went below my waist and got caught on everything! I ended up cutting them and tying a knot and I‚Äôm good to go! Definitely recommend!
4.0,The chain was a bit smaller than I expected. Still fit and looks great but doesn't have the drape I was expecting. I'll probably be buying a small extender to lengthen it a bit.
4.0,"Works awesome. Traveled around 3 continents hating electronic accessory and cord storage. This is great. I kind of wish I would have bought the larger one, but this one fits great in my messenger bag."
4.0,Product is what was expected.
4.0,The dress fits well. The neck is weird. It doesn't lie flat.
4.0,It runs a bit big but the fabric and dress itself is great i had to return a medium and get a small the transaction went great and I'm happy
4.0,"These are super cute, and the cherries are adorable. I typically wear a size Medium and that is what I ordered. The top fits very well and the buttons do not pucker like they do on many button down pjs (I am a 32DD). The bottoms however fit like they are a full size smaller than the top. It's weird. The waist is fine but the hips, butt, and thighs fit like a size small instead of a medium. They have some stretch so they aren't unwearable, but they are skin tight in parts."
4.0,"I dont like cause no tags on , but I  can tell  its  new so I decided to keep it . I love the pattern , looks good on me"
4.0,Size up one size.  I ordered in my regular size and one up b/c of reviews.  Reg size fits but not as flattering as going up one size.  Returned regular size and kept other.  I‚Äôll get a lot of use out of this outfit hoping it launders well.
4.0,"Just received this bag, haven't had a chance to really use it but I'm please with what it is.  I'm planning on carrying it either crossbody with the long strap or hooked to the sternum strap on my backpack to carry things I'd like easy access to.  I've been using a hip pack for a while but I found the weight on my waist and hips annoying especially on long hikes/climbs.  Hopefully this new bag fits the bill.<br /><br />The construction seems solid and there is plenty of space to put phone, wallet, map, clif bar, etc.  I like that the strap is just connected with mini carabiners so you can reconfigure and hook it to yourself a couple different ways.<br /><br />The only oddity is the packable aspect.  It's not a very large bag and I don't really see any reason I've ever want to stuff it slightly smaller especially if it has to be empty.  If that's something you want I can say that it stuffs into the interior pocket about as well as you would expect.  I might cut out the interior pocket, sew it shut, and use it as another small bag."
4.0,these are durable- comfy wear well and fit fantastic- I wear a 7.5 and have very bad swelling in mt feet and legs so at end of day need a soft comfy slipper to slid into- these ar so comfy and fit well - I have ordered 3x now-- I order 2 pair each time as am afraid one time they will no longer be available  so do your tooties a favor get a pair or several
4.0,bought compression socks prior to last international flight. They work. Going to order another pair. At 74 I have some swelling in left leg. Socks help.
4.0,"Fits good.  I got the small. I am 5‚Äô3, 133, athletic build."
4.0,These are adequate for a disposable glove. I wish I had gotten the next size up. usually use a large in most latex gloves - I really need an XL for these.
4.0,"I bought 2 of these bracelets and sent one to a friend, she loved hers and I am thrilled.  I noticed the one I kept for myself has a few letters worn off the engraving of Serenity prayer.  It is not a big deal, no one will look close enough to see it, overall pleased with the look of bracelet ..."
4.0,Great product for a stocking stuffer. Obviously for someone who loves batman
4.0,"I thought with these being oversized goggles they would fit fine. Got them and they‚Äôre awesome, but they fit a little snug on the bridge of my nose."
4.0,GREAT MY SON LOVES THESE GLASSES COMPLIMENTED EVERYWHERE HE GOES WITH THEM..MANY PEOPLE ASK HIM WHERE HE PURCHASED THEM  .
4.0,"Nice, work appropriate shirt. I wanted a baggier look so I sized a up and I‚Äôm glad I did..."
4.0,Legs ride up while pedaling. .
4.0,This dress was adorable and made of good quality. It did run a bit small but since we only needed it for a birthday party we were able to make due.
4.0,"These have been great for me.  I use them while bicycling and in nursing school, to cover up my tattoos.  When I bike with them, my arms feel better with them then without them in multiple ways.  I feel the air more, without the burn of the sun, the compressing helps me with soreness as well.  (They also seem to accentuate muscles, which is cool). I only gave 4 stars because the stitching is coming undone a little, and I've only had them for a month."
4.0,Good quality material and appears well made. My husband looks great in it! He did mention that it fit a little snugly and I purchased his regular size for underwear.
4.0,"it's a velvety dress and the color is super cute! it's very short, and busty girls beware. it fits very tight, I'd recommend going up a size if you're not looking for the bodycon fit."
4.0,Lightweight.  Pretty color.  Ponytail exit.<br />Strange design but lots of material to fit your noggin with slouch
4.0,Swings above its price point. Cheap leather bands often fit weird but this one feels fine on wrist. Quality is acceptable. Looks good.
4.0,"These work really well! The clips are not as large as on some other brands which makes them more comfortable to wear inside boots. As with all  clips of this type, just be sure to attach them in front of or behind your ankle bone or fold the pants up (the strap length is adjustable) and attach them above the ankel bone and you won't have any problem."
4.0,"These are great, and so adorable, but they do run a little small. I ordered the large, which says it would fit size 10-11.5M, but they were too small for size 11M boots. They fit perfectly in size 10M boots. (I tried them with Kamik Toddler Rain Boots)."
4.0,Product is nicer in person.  Picture does not do it justice.  Great size broach and nice colors does not look tacky.
4.0,this hoodie is very soft material is good quality..hope it stands up to washing because if so I will buy another. the only complaint is that in the pic it looks maroon but it is actually more red
4.0,I like this top. I did have to return the first one and order a different size--the first was a medium and the 2nd was an XL and it now looks and fits great. I normally wear a Small-Medium in tops. The material is not stretchy and not forgiving in any area. The length is nice and does not show belly when I raise my arms. I was also very pleased with the return process--I did not have to wait too long for everything so I could have this top.
4.0,"This is a very nice dress with only a couple of problems. Problem one - it's a little long for me. I can fix it with some tall shoes, but it might be tough for ladies who are shorter, at least with the large. I generally wear a large, being that I'm 5'5&#34; and 160lbs, and this large seems to have a comfortable amount of room, even in the arms, which is generally a problem for me. Problem two - there's a band at the back meant to frame your derriere, but the lining keeps it from being secure, so there will likely be some tugging to keep it in place.<br /><br />But for the price, this dress is amazing."
4.0,"It's ok, it's about what you would expect. I'm sure It'll be be fine, for what it is."
4.0,You and see your face
4.0,Love this item. It's very comfortable but doesn't sit well on the waist. Other than that love them
4.0,"This is a very nice and soft oversized hoodie, but I could have gotten the same thing without the beer pocket at Walmart for $20."
4.0,"I really like the necklace and wear it often.  I looks expensive, not too shiny, but I thought it would be thicker."
4.0,Great cap. This was the second one I have ordered.
4.0,"Cheap slick material, doesn‚Äôt really look like the picture. It‚Äôs a return for me."
4.0,I am 5‚Äô3 and 166lbs and size 12 was great.  These are very soft stretchy pants however I wish they were more like a jegging type and hugged the angle more they‚Äôre not as the skin tight as I would hope but they are beautiful Pants
4.0,Beautiful blouse but runs very small.
4.0,find to protect from sunburn ~~~not for good looks:&#62;(
4.0,Feel better after washed a few times
4.0,"Very sweet little necklace, gave to my daughter on mother‚Äôs day"
4.0,la suavidad
4.0,Excellent fit and quality for the price
4.0,brim alot longer than i thought it would be but it fits well and it was made with quality material
4.0,Larger than ecpected
4.0,nice front pocket wallet. üòÄ
4.0,I LOVED IT... It's not the best option if you're looking for a spacious purse
4.0,Got this for my Laptop bag strap which was digging into my shoulder. It makes it a lot more comfortable to wear but I expected the pad to be more soft.
4.0,A little floppy
4.0,Never got to use this but it was beautifully made. A little large for newborn
4.0,Nice hat and very sturdy but very large.  Going to have to put something inside the hat to make it smaller.
4.0,"the white lining shows some on the top, but other than that it fits great and is extremely flattering"
4.0,"Simple, not susceptible to wear and tear, and my husband loves it."
4.0,"I received this on time with a good package. Unfortunately it is not the bra that fit my dress well, it still shows the side."
4.0,"The shirt is absolutely beautiful and good quality. I ordered 1 size up, but it was too big."
4.0,Loved the material<br />It ran a little small
4.0,"Unique design and very well made. I brought it for a girlfriend and she loved it. When we went out people commented about how much they liked it,"
4.0,"I haven't worn it yet, but it is pretty and fits nicely. It appears that it will be flattering on most body shapes and sizes!"
4.0,Nice leather belt.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my sister. She seemed to like it
4.0,Nice print.  Fabric is comfortable with silky feel but it needs to have a little stretch.  Can be a bit snug.
4.0,"We had an old beige mildewy umbrella canopy that was about 10 years old, found this and it popped right on.  Very pretty color."
4.0,"I used this dress for a party and I loved it very flowy and confortable, it fit me just right, I am 5'3 and weigh 205lb and it fit right above the knee. Size large."
4.0,As expected...Works Great
4.0,Great fit. Material seems to be good quality.
4.0,I have given many as gifts and everyone loves them.<br />I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE TINY EYE VERSION NEED MORE CLEAR COLORED STONES  TO GIVE MORE PAZZAZ OR MORE COLORS.
4.0,"Just ok, wish they were thicker..."
4.0,"Like most Carter‚Äôs things, these fit small & shrink in the wash. But still nice to find a classic pair of shirts for my son."
4.0,The bottoms are not shorts more like panties. Fully covered panties. The top is okay the material isn't what I expected. You definitely get what you pay for. Fours stars because the bottoms are not shorts like pictured. It could still work if that what you're looking for. It's cute but I wanted shorts
4.0,"This  bra  is  awesome!  Bye bye  uni boob,  does  run  a  bit  small,"
4.0,My brother loves this show and he loves the socks. They are a bit thin but he loves it
4.0,"Absolutely LOVE this dress! I wore it to a wedding this past weekend and it was so comfortable and cute. I received so many compliments! (Even from the bride who is a seamstress and loved the vintage feel)<br />My one caution is that the buttons ARE REAL and will come undone if you are a bit busty like me.<br /><br />(5ft 8in, 38DD, and 226lbs wearing a 2XL for reference)"
4.0,"My daughter loves the shirt, however it fits smaller than most other 10/12 shirts."
4.0,Earrings are as described. Vibrant color
4.0,I Love The fit but the zipper digs into my skin.
4.0,"Nice mask, high quality.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting something so rigid though.  When my husband smiled it moved up and covered his eyes."
4.0,"Nice thick material. Look great. Fit great. Would be five stars, but button fell off first time I wore it."
4.0,They're not very long and in Chinese sizes which always makes me feel like a moose when I order. I was working on a costume and have ordered a few brown pleather leggings to alter and they're never as they are pictured. They do seem to be made well and are a great faux leather material. Try again I guess
4.0,I liked this sweater but felt it ran a bit small
4.0,"I have a large head.  7 5/8"" hat size.  I got the red/black with maybe orange lens.  Nose piece and temples fit very well and are very comfortable.  Excellent optical clarity.  Only 4 stars due to lower coverage for on the water or snow - the lenses may not be large enough vertically top to bottom to offer coverage from reflection from water or snow from below.  I can easily see below the glasses if that makes any sense."
4.0,"Bought this dress, and it was super cute in the photos and also upon arrival.  Further inspection and trying it on, I noticed that the shoulderless side was awkward fitting.  If you have a larger chest size (above size B) and have a curvy figure,  the dress looks unattractive in the chest area, especially on the shoulderless side. This dress was made for someone who is small chested and who has a thin build.  Otherwise, it was a super cute dress,  was just not able to wear it."
4.0,"Beautiful dress but runs rather small. I‚Äôm a busty gal and it was a bit tight throughout, had to wear a waist cincher underneath."
4.0,"pretty, good quality but on the small side.  Also the hook does not stay in your ear very well."
4.0,"The Necklace was nice, as described, but their was a bead missing from the tassel part and it obviously looked like it was supposed to be there. I returned the product and received full refund within a day or two."
4.0,They are very good sunglasses both my boyfriend and I like them very much .
4.0,It‚Äôs ok!
4.0,I love these tanks! Super comfortable and a nice variety of colors.]
4.0,Beautiful but wish it was longer
4.0,It seems very well made. But may I make a suggestion please put the dimensions of your product I was disappointed on the size if it was larger I would have liked it better.
4.0,Socks are good for the first few uses.  Loose tension faster than originally produced Copper style Socks. Expected production cutbacks but totally different materials used.  Very light weight but will hold compression for a few uses.
4.0,its a hat.
4.0,"Small inexpensive and looks very nice. I bought the one for ""an extra son""."
4.0,This bra is nice my only complaint is that it fits a little weird on the sides.
4.0,The dress is good for the price. It feels and fits nicely. Except the top is way too loose. It'll definitely fall down unless you tape it. I got a small and it is still way too big in the top.
4.0,"Very light, almost too light as it feels kinda cheap. It does sit nice."
4.0,"I really like these bags. As others have said, the little ones that are included are VERY small and don't hold much, but these larger ones do hold a lot and fit on the regular shopping carts. I got the blue/green pattern and would've liked a different one, but that was all that was available at the time. Great price for what you get with it!!!"
4.0,"I ordered these bifocals to use while geocaching and they really work great. They are super cute and give just the kind of sight I need while out and about. They are so lightweight that I worry a little about how long they will last, but the price was right so it's fine."
4.0,Can not see out of the little slits for eyes
4.0,Hat fits ok.  I thought the quality was just ok.
4.0,These shorts are very cute. They are soft and are also made with good quality material. Only complaint is they fit a little snug on my little one.
4.0,It‚Äôs a very cute watch band for the most part. I have a small wrists so if I clip it too tight it‚Äôll hurt but if I go one loop down it‚Äôs too loose on me.
4.0,Cute. It's smaller than I expected so won't last as long. Not as soft as some other organic fabrics like Hanna Andersson...lets be real. But the price isn't the same either.
4.0,I wish I could give it 5stars because I loved the suit it came very elegant and well packaged. The material doesn‚Äôt look cheap. I sized up to his normal size in clothes but It still just didn‚Äôt fit my boy who‚Äôs a little heavy set. Im sure the next size would have been great but I couldn‚Äôt reorder being that I ordered last minute for the event.
4.0,"great product. shipped fast, easy to use, has lasted a long time with no problems. would buy again, and recommend to friends"
4.0,This is a decent hat for the price. I have a large head and I like that it‚Äôs adjustable. The front part doesn‚Äôt fit snugly as you can see in the picture despite adjusting it very which way -<br />but that‚Äôs my only complaint. Overall not bad!
4.0,"necklace is pretty, difficult to open"
4.0,"Petite band, more suited for a woman‚Äôs wrist, not a man‚Äôs"
4.0,"3.5 These have a good stretch and are sort of comfortable for jeans, but compared to some women‚Äôs stretch jeans, not really. Some of those feel as comfortable as sweatpants or leggings, and these aren‚Äôt there. They are comfortable in a ‚Äúcomfortable for jeans‚Äù way, which is to say, compared to stiff scratchy non stretching things, they‚Äôre better.<br />Just because they‚Äôre for guys doesn‚Äôt mean we need to do this, you know? Just use the same fabric."
4.0,"Love it! Fits good, usually i wear a M but i went with a L, its a little bigger then id like, its more wide then it is long which sucks but other then that, its an awesome shirt."
4.0,Great looking shoe for work and very comfortable. They are easy to wear and I don‚Äôt trip or drag my feet like I do in crocs.  Only downfall is that they make a ton of noise when you are walking.  I thought after a few weeks of wear they would break in and become less noisy but that‚Äôs not the case.
4.0,"I love these sunglasses however, I have purchased three pairs. I love designer sunglasses but kept losing them or breaking though so I decided to find cheap sunglasses for a while. I found these and absolutely love them. They are the oversized look that I like and people always think they are expensive. My only issue with them is that I‚Äôve had three pairs break now, literally one of the sides just fell off each time. I‚Äôve had them about 3 months at a time so pretty disappointing but the style is on point."
4.0,"I received these pants almost over a week early, which I was super surprised! They do run a tad bit small so I'd would order a size up if possible. I'm a little over 6&#34; and the length on them is amazing! Just what I hoped for."
4.0,Beautiful dress but did not realize that it had a name on it which my granddaughter was not happy about
4.0,great bag for a quick trip shopping. I like it and will share this type of bag with friends.
4.0,"Ordered for my son, and he really likes it, but if I order any more I will order a size larger than usual."
4.0,It‚Äôs ok....
4.0,"They look cool, but the lenses are blue! I expected them to be Amber or pink. They sure look cool and, from the front, look as advertised."
4.0,Nice looking view not very sharp on the time.
4.0,Love the style.  Lightweight but sturdy.  A bit too snug for my wrist so can't wear for prolonged period.  I like cuff bracelets and Gypsy Jewels in general however
4.0,"I have thin legs, and this are a bit snug even for me.  But I love how they look.  I just wish they were a little more thick and that I could wear over my tights,"
4.0,"it was a gift, but I like the colors and the texture of the fabric."
4.0,Nice bright color reasonably priced
4.0,"The curtain image is a bit pixellated, but I kind of like it because it looks like a painting anyways."
4.0,Nice shirt for golf
4.0,nice fabric---fits well.
4.0,"Love the jeans - as I get older, I like less ‚Äòfitted‚Äô pants. These are high waisted, so no peek a boo, important as I age, wide legged, also important as my hips age & spread. Deep pockets - for phone. Flattering fit, a nice little accent at the front hem.<br />These would be absolutely PERFECT if the had juuuussst a little bit of stretch!"
4.0,Was hard fit over my shouders.
4.0,"I like these leather driving gloves.  They are comfortable and the leather is good quality.  They are not the warmest of gloves, and they run a bit large, but that's what I wanted."
4.0,"I ordered a size small.  (5‚Äô2. 112lbs and petite, pear shape). My lower body is bigger so I could understand that it felt tight there but the arms were also very tight.  I usually order a small so I would definitely recommend sizing up."
4.0,I am 5&#34;6 220 pounds and the dress fits as expected. Not too small or tight. I like my cloths loose and not fitted. The loose fit perfect for me.
4.0,These bike shorts have a great fit to them and they are thick which I like because you can‚Äôt see anything through them. And they are comfortable with the high waist. But what I did not like about them is they were a bit long for me. If I purchase again will buy a medium rather than large.
4.0,"Comfortable, attractive and the regular length is a good size for women/smaller wrists. Like that it has the RAF style nylon strap keeper instead of metal - I work on a computer all day and it makes it much easier to type. I'm using these with a Vector Luna smartwatch and they fit perfectly. Not sure how long these will last but they are so inexpensive it doesn't really matter."
4.0,They are nice pants real comfortable but not for me I can see every dent that I  have in my legs Lol. I'm giving them to my granddaughter she'll love them.
4.0,"I bought this hat for my fianc√©. He is a huge comic book fan! It is well made and the embroidery looks very nice. According to him, it is super comfortable and fits perfect. The artwork under the brim looks incredible as well, but it's hard to notice it unless you're super close up"
4.0,Love these haveittall tshirts.  They cover my belly. Ha ha
4.0,I love animal print everything so when I saw this it was a no-brainer. The colors are exactly the same in person as they are in the product images. The material is lightweight and stretchy and it's long enough that I can wear this with leggings and feel very comfortable. The only thing I'm not totally sold on is the long animal print on the cuffs. I wish it was a little smaller since it looks a bit like you're wearing gloves at times. It's not a deal breaker for me but it's not my favorite aspect of the design. Overall though I really like this.
4.0,"Sizing suggests an XL, I wear a size 8 in US and I should have bought a L. Otherwise good quality item."
4.0,I read all the reviews so I ordered a size up. I‚Äôm 5.2 and over 200 lbs and to make sure the top fit the girls I ordered a 4x and it was way to big. The bottoms worked good. I had to get the sewing machine out and try and make it work.
4.0,great shirt...fit as expected.....i would buy it again in a different color
4.0,Seems like good quality but sizing runs way too small. I normally wear size large tops but I wanted this to be baggy so I ordered an XL. I could barely get it on after going a size up
4.0,"love the blouse, thinking of buying the black one as well. wish the length would be a bit longer."
4.0,"I actually prefer this strap to the timex strap.  This one is more firm/solid.  I wish the leather had a little bit more shine to it, but i would recommend this to anyone."
4.0,The pearl is beautiful.  I wore it for my sons wedding.  The color was perfect to match my grayish/ blue dress.  The only issue is that the chain of the necklace was thin and cheap.  I replaced it so it so it looked better and was stronger to hold the big pearl size..  I was worried that the necklace would break at the wedding.  The pearl was stunning.
4.0,I like the stitches in white
4.0,"The cards can be pretty hard to take out of this wallet, even when there is not hardly anything in it.  I do like the wallets small size, money clip, and quick ID window."
4.0,"I am 74kg 1.74m and i purchased M size Very confy. Had several fall and protect very well. The only fall that i got bruise on my hip was at 50kmh on asphalt landing first on my hip, i think that without protective short it could be worst. Took 1 star for the price!!"
4.0,I really like this product and would recommend it to all.
4.0,"I needed a cheap pair of glasses that didn't look cheap and these were perfect for that.  Sure enough, I forgot them on the plane when vacationing.  I'm not torn about it bc it served its purpose and I'll most likely buy another pair.  These definitely feel like cheap sunglasses, however they don't LOOK like cheap sunglasses.  They aren't heavy and have a &#34;good feel&#34; like my other designer shades, but that's okay.  I'm glad I lost these and not my $300+ ones!"
4.0,Cute and love the hand band. Easy to put on by just pulling to adjust the bands. Good for the price.
4.0,"This is a high quality case that is very sturdy. The biggest problem for me was that I was hoping to use this for some smaller sunglasses, but this case is too small for any sunglasses. These were originally marketed for sunglasses, but it looks like the listing has been changed to not say this anymore. This is a good case for reading glasses, but will not work for sunglasses.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
4.0,Tight fit but will keep wind out of my eyes. Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,Perfect art nouveau design with a beautiful shade of green copper turquoise. I also like how light these earrings are.
4.0,Really cute. Very cheap. I like the feel of the cotton. One of the two snaps on the neck was defective. I would still order again. My kid likes it.
4.0,Love the color and the feel of the material but I didn't like the sleeves. I wanted a summer shirt so I had the sleeves cut off. The material for is bad about static electricity and it was literally shocking but that problem was easily taken care of with a fabric softener sheet
4.0,"Its comfy,but very big. I recommend you too buy a size or 2 down."
4.0,I gave these to my daughters for Valentines day. Allow a LONG time for delivery. We had to reattach the chain the first day.. hopefully it will hold. But my daughters love them (13 and 9 years old)
4.0,I sized up just to be cautious & glad I made the decision to do so. besides the sleeves hugging my arms it‚Äôs manageable& soft
4.0,"There are cute and stylish. The feel a bit cheap and look it close up, but for the price that is to be expected."
4.0,Warm and fits perfectly
4.0,"Shirt runs a bit large, I ordered true to size and it fits very comfortably and could have sized down one. Very soft and comfortable. I wash and hang dry and it does tend to wrinkle a bit but if you hang it right away or set in bathroom when taking a shower wrinkles come right out!"
4.0,"At first glance you would think - high quality and well made... BUT when you look closer you will notice that the buttons are barely held on with only a few stitches.<br /><br />The shirt is true to fit. I feel like the material composition is definitely that of a ""work"" shirt and not a ""Oxford Casual"" shirt.<br /><br />There is a bue patch on both elbows, but hardly noticeable<br /><br />Bottom line? It is my opinion that the shirt is NOT worth $30.99!"
4.0,is ok..  the fabric is a bit stiff. even after washing.  but will work for around the house in hot weather
4.0,"I chose this item for my 6'7"" pickleball-player husband because we live in the PNW where it can get rather cool outside, which is the best place to play the best sport in the world. Size XL fits him perfectly, even in the overall length and that of the sleeves. The moisture-wicking feature actually works. And the side panels (front and back) as well as at the back yoke/panel look really nice. Plus, the sort of dark grey with black color is perfectly inconspicuous. In summary, this is a nice moisture-wicking long-sleeve athletic shirt that fits true to size."
4.0,"I have been using this band for many fitness activities, running, biking, swimming, strength training. The band fits my FR935 perfectly and the quick release is solid. I have other similar bands by this company and I am very satisfied. The quality, comfort, and price are excellent."
4.0,Edge on the links are a tiny bit sharp. That is why it lost one star. Other then that. The bracelet is beautiful. Especially for the price. I was able to successful remove some links just in case those with a smaller wrist are wondering if they can fit this bracelet. It was a little bit tough taking out the links but that is a good thing. The weight on it feels good and was very easy to put on once you figure out how. I add that in because I read some reviews stating that some were having a little trouble latching the bracelet on. Once it's on. It pretty much stays on well. Can't wait to wear it when I go out.
4.0,Great watch. But the directions for setting some of the features like the hourly alarm or setting of the 24hr mode could be better explained in the directions.
4.0,"Beautiful band but it could be longer. It never occurred to me, but I must have unusually large wrists. I can get to the 2nd hole in order for the two retaining loops to hold the band down. Unfortunately the second notch makes the band so tight that my fingers go numb and the veins pop out on my hand. So I am stuck at the 1st hole where the retaining loops are useless. None the less I am satisfied with the band pricing."
4.0,"I actually like this camisole, but I ordered an XL and it‚Äôs a bit too snug.  I am small-boned,, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 130.  Normally I wear size 8.  So size up at least 2 sizes unless it want it tight."
4.0,Best thing
4.0,"Adorable set, though, material felt kind of cheap, but given the price, not terrible, and the sizes run small, not a whole lot of stretch to the material, top seemed way bigger than the bottoms. Not much for support. When i ordered, i was a 235lbs and the suggestion was an xl, the top fit like a 2x and the bottoms fit like a large. I feel to get the right fit, i should have purchased 2 sets LG for the top and 2x for the bottoms."
4.0,seemed good quality for the price
4.0,Comfortable but hardly any belly support
4.0,Great price it was nice
4.0,"I LOVE this dress. The colour is a nice deep ruby/burgundy. The quality of the material is very good especially for the price. I am 5'2"" and 135 pds. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. The only negative is the zipper which is so fragile that I only unzip halfway to get in and out of the dress."
4.0,"It's a very lovely dress just that it fits very small, I will have to resend the xl for double x! And I wear medlarge or so I thought."
4.0,"My measurements are 36DD(44.5"" bust all around with a bra), 32"" waist, 38"" hips. I'm really top heavy, slight waist, narrow hips. What fits the top is always too loose on the bottom. That's how the XL dress fit on me. My chest spills out the top & bottom half is swimming in fabric. Of course my husband loves that, bless his heart.<br />The dress is very cute but the fabric is pretty cheap, thin & print not the best. I wouldn't recommend tossing it in the washing machine, I hand washed & hung dry to be sure I got more than one wear out of it.<br />The design overall is very pretty & classic. I got the Black Polka dot, wore a black slip (a must with the fabric so thin), Ralph Lauren black peekaboo wedges, & threw a black 3/4 sleeve button up v-neck cardigan to finish up the look. Super cute & classy for church, the office, or brunch with the girls.<br />-FIREMAN'S WIFE"
4.0,"Very attractive.  I had ordered a 2x as a gift, it was way to snug.  I ended up gifting to someone who wore an extra large and it fit just right."
4.0,"I really like these socks.  They have helped with the swelling I have been having in the top of my foot, my ankle and leg.  Been looking for other colors to order."
4.0,Very Sparkley
4.0,These are my go to pants. They are soft and cozy. I now have 2 pairs. The first one is XL. I mistakenly ordered a large on the second pair. They fit comfortably too. They run a bit short though. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and I‚Äôm frequently pulling the ankles down. I highly recommend this pant.
4.0,"It's a cute dress. It runs kinda small/tight and material is kinda thin . I ordered a medium...it fits like a small. I needed it to be fitted, but not too small(I have a lil gutüòÇ). I will exchange for a large."
4.0,The bottom layer is a little loose so they still rise up when you exercise. I probably could have sized down but I wasn't sure on the sizing and was afraid my thunder thighs wouldn't have looked very good haha<br />Shorts are still really comfortable though!
4.0,"Cute glasses, BUT I didn't receive a eyeglass pouch that was portrayed in the picture, I ordered two pair...."
4.0,"It doesn't have a black stone in the ball, its just plain silver. But it is still pretty and sits well. Not to heavy, very light."
4.0,".  I like my hat very much.  Its as described, light weight for summer and I have received several compliments."
4.0,My hat fits as I thought it would . I'm just not s hat person but I want to stay out of the sun so I will ware it !!!
4.0,It was nice but wish it didn‚Äôt ripped.
4.0,These are really cute. They fit well. They are a little bit thin but not bad. I love how stretchy they are.
4.0,"this is a soft, shiny, rayon blouse. It's a pretty color and nicely made,The sleeves are a little long. the numbers for XXL should have fit me with plenty of room to spare."
4.0,"I got this a discounted price for a fair and honest review. Very Cute! A bit larger than expected, nickel sized not so much so that can't be worn. Very pretty, Very solid. No fears of breakage or easily falling off. Chain appears sturdy enough to hold pendant and nice enough to wear for multiple occasions. I collection puppy jewelry having 4 dogs and this is a great addition to my collection. This will match the open crystal doxie pendant well that I currently own."
4.0,Need to find a way to secure it so it doesn't fall as easily or rotate around arm
4.0,"The bag is nice quality and I liked that the hardware is metal and not plastic, like others. The compact size is perfect for a daypack to hold the essentials like phone, wallet, keys, glasses etc. The charging cable on the inside was disconnected when I received it and I'm not sure if I can re-connect it or if it's simply broken. If it is broken, I'll need to return it. But I think that I could probably do without the USB charger as it seems to be in the way a bit. This bag would be perfect with a few modifications to improve the design and functionality. I wish the USB charging port was below the mesh pocket instead of above it as it currently obstructs the opening of the mesh pocket. I'd also like the mesh pocket to be a little larger in order to accommodate a water bottle. It would also be nice if the bag had a safety pocket for a wallet or money located on back panel (inaccessible from the front), like some other backpacks have. Overall a good product but could use some improvement."
4.0,"I really liked how soft and comfortable this set is. The hooded zip up jacket is a bit oversized, so size down for a more fitted look. Overall, it's a great quality set."
4.0,Ordered a small which is what I always get and the fit is nice. Sleeves are a little short but fine. Ordered brown but the color I received is not the brown color that is shown in the pics. üôÑ
4.0,Snug for an 8.5 but they‚Äôll work. Little brighter pink than I hope. They smell really bad but I think letting them air out will help.
4.0,Get the job done but a little stiff to work in
4.0,Thread is coming loose.
4.0,"I absolutely love this bra and I hate wearing bras! I am a 34 C and the medium fits perfectly, but my third purchase is more snug than my first and second ones. Don‚Äôt know why this is, the beige and black ones fit great but the khaki one feels like a size small rather than a medium. I double checked to make sure I received a medium and I did. Hopefully this won‚Äôt happen again if I order more."
4.0,I would appreciate some kind ov a contact # or an email contact in order 2 place another order... I don't normally like to do a review &/or
4.0,Well made but ran really large. Sadly we returned it.
4.0,"Fits as expected, nice long length pairs well with leggings, fabric is soft and it washed with minimal shrinkage. Only complaint is the neck is wide so bra straps will show."
4.0,"Look good, I'm sure they'll work fine, have not tried yet."
4.0,"I got this when I was pregnant and clothes were uncomfortable and I was always hot üòÇ nice and thin, but not so thin that it is see through or you feel it'll rip. Comfortable!"
4.0,TRUTH is: This is actually Navy Blue NOT BLACK!! Other than that it fits pretty comfortably. I'm 5'4 170lbs breast size 36/38DD. I would have given a 5 star rating if it was the color it's advertised as.
4.0,Nice top but it doesn't run small as some said. I now have to send it back.
4.0,"Slippers are super soft and fit perfectly. However, it can become uncomfortable wearing over time. It made my heel ache, I believe that was due to the thickness."
4.0,"Nice Little Shirt, soft silky fabric, and roomy enough to cover my 47&#34; hips while allowing for my 45&#34; bust .. graphics are good quality and Manufacturing is of good quality.. no complaints!!! will buy again and would recommend to others! Here is the link ....https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DBMORUW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2<br />Go for it!! Nice Product!!  I'm a happy camper! will post pics later when download from phone..."
4.0,Super cute- a little high in the slit at the crotch but doable.
4.0,"If you shop at the FOREVER store that comes before the number 22, this is basically their basic medi dress with a criss cross boob pattern. I will say, this material feels like it'll last longer than the forever 22 version.  It's not a bad dress, but it's pretty basic"
4.0,This is a pretty dope price for what is in the package. The wearable area is incredibly small! If you have fat lobes these might be small. Definitely going to keep buying these sets until I get to my goal size though.
4.0,"Love these! I‚Äôve gotten lots of compliments on how cute these are, and I was surprised at how comfortable and warm they are. I did find that they don‚Äôt seem to have an anti-slip bottom which is a bit of a bummer, especially if I wear them in the snow or rain. Otherwise, I‚Äôm impressed and absolutely love these."
4.0,"My butt is apparently not in the size range I chose. Fits perfectly everywhere but there. In fact it is so small around the hips the when I bend over without wearing pj pants it is indecent. The fit everywhere else is perfect, the robe is soft and beautiful. Of course, it is silk so the tie/side slips loose all the time if you don't use the inside ties, which I've always found a weird inconvenience. All in all I really enjoy the robe, and hope to walk my butt into the right size."
4.0,"I'm a stay-at-home mom, I practice yoga while my little one is taking nap. These are my first yoga socks and comparing to other yoga socks, these socks are at a very favorable price, $3.5 each. Even I received this product in exchange for my evaluation and honest, unbiased review, I'd like to rate this item 4 stars.<br />I usually wear size 5 or 5.5, and these socks just fit perfectly to my feet. they are comfortable to wear to me; however I doubt there are some people will feel too small. The feature of non-slip sole does help keep feet securely in place, but the material is just not as soft as what I expected."
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars because it fits very well (the only downside is the length, too long for me) and the patterns is beautiful, but the fabric is not cotton"
4.0,Shorts fit well. Material was a little thinner than I expected and is very silky smooth. Overall good shorts.
4.0,"The snugwind Women's Summer Tank Jumpsuit is a bit of a throwback for me, evoking overalls and jumpers of many years past. Let me give you my impressions:<br /><br />The good:<br />- super comfortable and soft<br />- perfect easy casual outfit<br /><br />The bad:<br />- I don't think the fabric is going to hold up that well after multiple wears & washes. So this is fine for casual use, but I wouldn't plan on dressing it up, as the fabric isn't likely to look new for long.<br /><br />I love this jumper for these mild spring days and plan on wearing it all summer long. I recommend as a casual jumper (only)."
4.0,COTTON WITH NOT MUCH GIVE SO ORDER LARGER IF A QUESTION ON SIZE
4.0,"Fits almost exactly, not too snug and not baggy!"
4.0,"Even though it fits about a size bigger than my regular size, I absolutely love it. The fit is nice, not snug. The feel is terrific. The sleeves are more than long enough."
4.0,I like it enough to try buying a smaller size. I had expected it much smaller than it is.
4.0,The glasses fit great and look good.
4.0,I love my purse material is good and flexible and size too... üòâüëçüèª
4.0,"Nice fabric , cute design. Comfortable. But ran a little large and ling for my height."
4.0,Nice shirt.  The hood  is not too thick. But shirt is thick enough
4.0,Purse is a little bstiff
4.0,Cute sweatshirt.  Comfy fabric. Runs small
4.0,90% satisfied!
4.0,Really great shirt but a little snug for my three year old.
4.0,"This is a beautiful print but it arrived slightly damaged. There was a small section on both the top and the bottom that were scrunched up a bit. A frame will hide most of it, but I think the packaging could have been a little better."
4.0,I hope it fits my petite Mom.
4.0,"I like it, but not love it.  It's good."
4.0,"Loved the dress, but don‚Äôt buy multiple sizes. You have to pay to return it to China. It‚Äôs not worth the cost.<br />Dress= gorgeous<br />I ordered up and down which was a mistake.<br />The size up took a very long time to arrive.<br />I had to sew it, but again, it looked gorgeous.<br />Too expensive to return."
4.0,"Loved the color and the soft material. Material is a bit thinner than I like, but has a nice hand and drape to it."
4.0,Good quality & fit. Perfect for those freezing cold California winters.
4.0,Similar to other boxers but waist VERY high
4.0,"Fits well. Material is soft. I have washed and dried, doesn‚Äôt shrink"
4.0,"This band is nice, but it‚Äôs going to be what you expect it to be for the price. Although I like how thin it is, I find myself going back to the thicker band frequently."
4.0,I was hoping that the letters were embroiled but they wasn‚Äôt! Otherwise the cap was acceptable!
4.0,Nice &#34;merch&#34; to satisfy FNAF elementary age kiddo.
4.0,They are nice for the price!
4.0,Use for work.
4.0,"Great just, and it's as expected.  The material is a stiff material, which I prefer with this kind of dress.  The navy is true to what is shown, and the dress itself is very flattering on my figure.  My only complaint is that it does seem to run a bit large for a true pencil dress.  I am 5'5&#34;, 160lbs, athletic/hourglass build, and a standard size 8.  I ordered the size medium, and I could have definitely gone with the small.  The dress fit, but it wasn't &#34;fitted&#34; like how a dress of this style should be.  I'm going to keep the medium for work attire, but the next time I purchase this dress (as I do like it enough to want it in another color), I'll be buying a small."
4.0,"Very satisfied! Phone is a picture like mentioned in previous reviews. Doesn‚Äôt disappoint! It‚Äôs rubbery, phone feels secure in my hands. Screen has a deep edge around it."
4.0,"This is a very light leather, lighter than the photo. It wasn't for me so I hit it with some dark shoe polish. It solved my problem."
4.0,"Its pretty good, and  although I have read the reviews saying it didn't fit them right, there are images of different sizes to help you decide as well if you are having trouble deciding and they tell you the sizes that are available as well. Overall no complaints and its pretty cheap too in comparison to buying it at a store."
4.0,"I have difficult time  finding swim suits that fit my bust.  My bra size is 36/G and I ordered XXXL.  It fits, and it pretty too! The only negative about this swim suits is the clasp.  The clasp at the back of the top is not very strong, I am afraid it might pop open. I may change the clasp or sew the back straps together.  For the price it is definitely worth it."
4.0,Greta ieam
4.0,"For the penny it cost (+7 dollars shipping, each) these ear cuffs are nice. they form to your easy and are a good size. i gave the first as a gift then bought another"
4.0,piece of junk for the toy saber.. excess plastic inside prevented any batteries from install so not worth the price.. don't buy
4.0,comfortable for small money
4.0,"Beautifully made, I usually wear a small in Patty Boutik but this shirt with the lace seemed to run a bit small on me in the armpits. I also didn‚Äôt want to have to wear a strapless bra being a 34D. Overall great shirt just not right fit for me."
4.0,Fantastic shoe. Very tight on my feet. I wear a 7.5 street shoe but ordered a 9 and they are perfect (no socks). My advice is order up at least 1 size bigger.
4.0,I like the style of these earrings. The only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars is because they are a bit heavy.
4.0,"Really cute, but a little bigger then I wanted, and heavy"
4.0,"They are great for securing your child's glasses but, my five year old's head was a little too big for them therefore, making his glasses fit too tight. So I would say these are for ages 0 to maybe 3 or 4 years old."
4.0,If you are slim it is flattering...if you have a belly it will look inflated with the pockets.
4.0,"Heavier than I expected. However, I guess this improves durability of the product."
4.0,So soft love the fit of this set!!!
4.0,Comfortable with some stretch.
4.0,its nothing special just a mask but wife loved it.
4.0,"It was the sleeve length that was somewhat too small. The rest of the shirt fit fine. Slim fit as expected. The neck is snug, but not uncomfortably so. At least in my opinion. The color was spot on, exactly as pictured. And the material and quality feels nice. Not thick, but very nice. I just roll up the sleeves and it is no problem. So I still enjoy the shirt. But that could be a deal breaker for longer armed gentlemen such as myself."
4.0,"Finally! Non slip socks that actually work.  Only 4 stars because one seam is already ripping. But, these work!"
4.0,These were cute as a button!
4.0,The bag is not the same shape in the image. It's wider but I still love it!
4.0,Its light and comfortable.
4.0,Gave it as a bff gift was super cute good quality especially for the price. Wish the chain was longer.. I need to buy an extension
4.0,My son love it but it is small with him
4.0,"Very beautiful and classy dress. As shown in the pictures. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars, is because I generally wear Small size, but I ordered a Medium based on the size chart of the seller (not the Amazon's one). So it ran a little large. The Small would fit perfectly on me."
4.0,Daughter reported back to work suddenly and was standing in place for 8 hours shifts.  These compression socks helped enormously with cramps and pain.  Nearly immediately.
4.0,"Looks great. However, the color is not the same as advertised but still looks good."
4.0,"This is a perfectly fine purse, just not for me. Baggallini no longer makes the model of purse that just died on me, so I had to go searching. I found the Pocket Crossbody but it is lacking in certain ways so I've been casting a wider net.<br /><br />According to the specs, this purse is only a half inch wider and taller than my Pocket Crossbody. But in reality it is and appears much bigger. One reason is the different build on the sides. The Pocket is more of a grocery bag construction while this one has an actual separate piece of fabric forming the sides. Another reason is the poking-upward part where the straps attach. And finally, the strap is much wider which doesn't suit me as a petite person.<br /><br />When I tried putting my stuff in, I had all kinds of extra room. So if you want roomy but not that big of a purse, this might be the one for you. I really like that it has two exterior slip pockets. There's a small one in front between the two zippers and a big one on the back with a magnetic snap closure. The lack of an exterior slip pocket on the Pocket model is my biggest gripe.<br /><br />I have decided to stick with the Pocket Crossbody and make some modifications on it. I like carrying a purse that is just big enough to fit my stuff and no bigger. Even though the Pocket is supposedly only a half inch smaller in height and width, it looks much better sizewise on my body. And its capacity is definitely less than this flap model which works better for me."
4.0,"Didn't fit, I was hoping it would be a smaller fit, but the small was still too large for me. Seemed like nice quality though."
4.0,Great product. I wish they were made of cotton.  They snag on the equipment
4.0,Light and comfortable. I may have ordered a little too big but don't mind it being a little loose for a house slipper.
4.0,It's nice but it started to come apart.
4.0,"Really pretty dress! Material is nice and fits well as long as you take your measurements and read the posting on the dresse's specific sizing! I usually wear a size 6-8 dress(or medium) and am 5'6, 145lbs but ended up getting an XL in this dress since that's what I measured as! Very nice quality dress, especially for the price! Can't beat that!"
4.0,"Knocking off a star for the inside not mimicing the look of the Doctor's watch, and it doesn't open a whole lot, but it was okay to give as a Christmas present to my sister."
4.0,Son liked these matte finish glasses.  We ordered these and some others and these arrived first.  Inexpensive and work fine.
4.0,A really cute dress!  Very thin so you will need a sweater in cooler months.  The fit runs a little small so order a size up if you do not want a snug feel. I ordered a different color in a larger size and it fits perfect for me.
4.0,"This outfit came on time, fit as discribed, and was adorable. The fabric was different then I imagined it would be but didn't seem to bother my daughter any. Definitely worth the buy!!!!"
4.0,"I have some pins that I like to have on my bag, but they kept losing the backs and I was worried I'd lose them eventually.  These locks have held up nicely and keep my pins in place just like they should."
4.0,I thought I ordered a medium but got a ex.small and it fits great. And I really like the belt
4.0,Nice jacket. Flimsy material. Run small.
4.0,"expedient delivery, size were as expected, one shirt seem under the arms is coming apart after one wash"
4.0,Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. Slippers fit as expected and look fabulous. The slippers came in a nice bag and looked more expensive than they actually were.  Would buy again!
4.0,Worked as described.  I had no problem applying to 3 hats and 4 caps that needed some size adjustment.  Did not have a problem removing the protective strip over the adhesive.
4.0,A little big but it's pretty!
4.0,Beautiful shirt! The colors are awesome and the shirt is well made. I love that the sleeves are designed loose enough to comfortably move in but not over done. Love the way it feels. Wore it with a pencil skirt; received many compliments.<br />FYI- 1) Sizing definitely runs small so order a size up! 2) The white part is a little sheer so I wore a cami underneath.
4.0,Looks like picture.
4.0,3.5 Stars<br /><br />I really like the look of these bike shorts.  The padding made a night and day difference to my riding on my road bike.  The mesh pockets on the side are great to throw my keys or phone into.<br /><br />These run a little small.  I normally wear a size 8 or medium.  Usually that is a perfect fit but these are almost uncomfortably tight.  If I loose about 5-10 lbs they will be perfect.  I don't mind how tight they are on my hips but on my thigh the lower leg portion is even tighter so they won't ride up (there is no chance of that by the way) and so they look a little funny if I'm standing because I have whatever the equivalent of muffin top is on my leg.<br /><br />Still overall I like how well the gel feels and the ride with them is pretty smooth.  The extra pockets are just a bonus as I like to have easy access to my phone.
4.0,"I GOT THESE PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHAGE IN MY HONEST REVIEW,. will I give 4 star of these one is because I would say somewhat to small I order small size base of my size for somewhat reason its very small, i like these bikini don't get me wrong ,.still fit in to me somewhat part of my body is really tight,.the design are magnifico mean excellent super sufisticated elegant bikini to wear for some type of elegant weaming party, very details the color are really exsactly in the picture,.its show my curve and the sexy body shape,.over all of these product are vey good quality almost perfect just to make it sure instead you order small , just order medium ,.perfect for summer to wear especialy in the beach ,."
4.0,More color & logo choices.
4.0,"I do like them,But they are Small."
4.0,"Product is nice but like most products could use some enhancement. For example, bangle bracelets are nice but I prefer bracelets with a clasp."
4.0,"Super soft material, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù so it‚Äôs a little long but I just tied up one corner and it was great. Very pretty blues. I got a 2x and fits nice but not roomy."
4.0,Nice suit ... good price .... holding up well with chlorine pool and FL sun!
4.0,"The suit itself fits very well on my 4-month-old. It looks wonderful!<br />The mask, however, is a complete miss! The eye holes are spaced with a much larger head in mind. No baby can wear this mask, even if they were inclined to keep something on their head and face in the first place. This is not my first baby, so I had no expectations of being able to keep a mask on my baby anyway. Just FYI for anyone with that intention."
4.0,"really really cute, fit well around my ankle. The only annoying thing is if it gets snagged on anything it will break apart and you have to put it back together so I do not recommend wearing with pants or anything that will pull on it, so you don't lose it!"
4.0,This is a birthday gift.
4.0,"After reading lots of reviews on this swimsuit, I finally bit the bullet and just ordered a Large (size 6-8) since I usually am a size 8. I am 5'5&#34; and am a little wider in the hips than my bust (36B cup). This fit me great with just a little more wiggle room in the stomach, which isn't too bad. I must have a shorter torso than most because I felt like I could pull the suit down for more coverage around my butt and thighs (but it didn't look quite right, to be honest). I agree with some other reviews that the cups are bigger than expected, but they are flatter and somewhat padded. So they ended up giving me an extra boost in the bust, which I don't mind. The material is thinner than my old Old Navy swimsuit, but it isn't see-through and is comfortable. I didn't see any loose seams or tears either, so I'm hopeful that it'll keep! I haven't worn this out to the beach or into the water yet, so I don't know what the wear and tear will be like. Overall, I'm satisfied with the sizing and am really relieved it fit without anything being overly tight or uncomfortable. It definitely is a flattering fit!"
4.0,"The band fits perfectly on the Asus Zenwatch 2. I have used it in the pool, showering, and sweating at the gym, and so far everything looks great, no wear and no rusting of any kind. I was a little weary at first, but I must say it fits the bill. The only thing I really found is that it is difficult to remove from the watch itself."
4.0,"Slightly shorter than I normally like, but overall very good."
4.0,"The band itself is very nice and stylish, in my opinion. But the reason I‚Äôm giving it only 4 stars is because of the double magnetic mechanism it has going on. It gets really tedious trying to put on the watch and adjust the fitting, especially when one of the magnets keeps preventing you to adjust it easily."
4.0,"Loved this, nice lighter fabric. And it has pockets!! But phone does pull dress down quite a bit, pockets best for more light items."
4.0,The shoe I received is not the one in the picture but it fits.
4.0,"Love this, it‚Äôs super cute, however the arms are a bit tight."
4.0,"This dress caught my eye the instant it was offered. I loved the adjustable spaghetti straps and the royal blue sequins that shimmer and catch the light.  The lines of sequins are very tiny and give the dress a fluid, flowing quality when you move. I was surprised to find it was true to size. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and usually wear either a 2X or 3X depending on the material. This 2X dress fits me because the material stretches, but it is a bit more clingy than I would wish for. The length hit just above the knee which was perfect.  There is a modesty panel inside since the material is slightly transparent. The only disappointment was the waist wasn‚Äôt tapered as shown in the main photo, but instead hangs straight down. It would be more attractive if it was slightly more fitted.  Still a nice dress for the price that you could wear to go out or to a party."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:756e964a91b43b6fe66f012ceaf5b427]] This is a very pretty bracelet. I wear it often. The chain is small even with the extra links. It's well made and hopefully it doesn't turn green like advertised.
4.0,Fabric is pretty thin but very comfy
4.0,"I Iike this dress, but i am 4'11 (and an adult), i bought a small and the dangly bits at the bottom touch the floor when i wear it, and get caught in my shoes when i bend down.  Plus it just looks too long and odd on me.<br />Other than the length though,  its nice."
4.0,Este articulo se ajusta a la promoci√≥n<br />Llego como se menciono a tiempo el color es justo como la foto.
4.0,"I ordered a toddler size 6, and it came in a European size which seemed to be wrong or much bigger. My daughter can‚Äôt even wear them"
4.0,This was a gift for my sister for Christmas and she reported that she REALLY likes it and was very happy with the material and color!
4.0,I really like this blouse and I previously bought a second one in a different color. It falls great and is not clingy!
4.0,"Somewhat small, but as expected."
4.0,"I have this attached to my body armor in such a way that it allows me to clip on other items that I may need handy. I do like the velcro loop but if the latch were made out of a poly instead of metal, I wouldn't have had to wrap tape around it to keep it silent. Otherwise, this is a fine product."
4.0,"If you ever happen to shop at a retailer like Ross Dress for Less, this is the exact quality you would get from there.  Specifically from the junior section where they have a bunch of no name brands that look cute but wasn't designed to last long.  Personally it looks cute but I know this blouse was not meant to worn for years on end and in some regards I am okay with that.  This is a thin, lightweight sweater.  So if you are self-conscious about your bra showing, just wear a nude color or wear a camisole underneath.  Personally I am shameless so I don't care unless I am cold, then I would throw this over a shirt."
4.0,Nice shirt! Thank you!
4.0,I like em! Good fit for big feet
4.0,Fits as expected. Runs small around the neck.
4.0,"I usually wear a large top because I am a tad 'top heavy', but this blouse is a little big.  I do like the blouse though, it washes and dries so nice.  Minimal ironing needed."
4.0,What I love: the fit was good. I like the cut- not to flared- not to slim. The arm holes aren‚Äôt super deep or revealing. I wore a bandeau type bra and it worked great. The pattern is just right. I‚Äôve worn it 2x now and I‚Äôve gotten several compliments from women who I‚Äôve never met. Also super comfortable.<br />The bad: washed it after the 1st wear in cold - short cycle and air dried but it still faded. Very disappointed about that. The main color is definitely faded and after the 2nd wash it faded some more. I wouldn‚Äôt mind it if it were a light color but it now looks way more worn than it should after only 2 wearings.
4.0,The wife loves these. Especially for the price
4.0,"It takes a couple of days to get used to. After that, it is what you want if you want a small compact and sturdy wallet. Don't expect to carry too much cash (I have not more than 5 notes usually for tips)  and remember you may have to take out all your cards if the card you are looking for is in the middle of the pack. I usually keep my DL and my main CC on either ends."
4.0,Definitely go a size down when ordering. This dress is made to fit loose but I ordered a medium and it fit more like a large
4.0,My grandson LOVES them.
4.0,I'm a 31 waist and this size fit perfect. The legs slide up on you a little otherwise Great!
4.0,"I do like it, although slightly snug around the bust area. Still plan to lose some more weight...so there you go!<br />Cute little frock and it's versatile.<br />I'm keeping it!"
4.0,This bag was purchased to store all of the goodies I need to carry on a long day in the city! Held up really well!
4.0,Great shirt quality for the price. The fabric is think with nice detailing.<br /><br />I usually wear an medium but should have trusted their sizing on their posting. I am 6 foot 160lbs and the medium was actually a little big and a little long.
4.0,First of all I will say these bras are great for the price. I have ordered before so I knew they do run small so you should definitely order up a size.  I gave them four stars for they do wear out quickly. The arrived on time and they ship in a bag which is fine they are only bras. Colors are exact also. I will order again it's worth order new every few months for the price.
4.0,"For the cheap price, I am completely satisfied with these glasses. The only warning I would give is the inner-reflectivity of the lenses. Often, when driving with them, I notice reflections or sunlight bouncing in from the sides. Not a big hassle, but minor saftey issue since it can grab your attention.‚Äã"
4.0,"Perfect for me! Many lounge pants are too long for me, but the elastic ankles make these pants work. I did notice that the elastic would eventually cut into my ankle and leave a red mark, especially if I slept in them.  This was no problem for me, but I'm a size 2, and someone with larger ankles might have a more pronounced issue with this."
4.0,"Muy confortable, ligera y cubre , bien de frio, adem√°s es impermeable"
4.0,Says it is topaz but size and price tell different story is it real
4.0,Really cute with a strappy sports bra. Wear it during yoga.
4.0,"Incredibly hard to put on, and also clumsy to grab things with. Still looks aesthetically pleasing, though!"
4.0,good shorts for sure
4.0,"My son likes them, and I like them. Nothing to complain. As per sizing they are as posted. My nine year old is 92 lbs, and he is bit tall for his age. And they fit better than either of use expected."
4.0,"I wear US Size 7-8 and these fit fine. However they are very thin, like but not exactly as womens stocking (which I believe are good for Tabi shoes). Great for sandals/flipflops and some Tabi shoes I picked up which I intended to have them function for. They go up past the ball of my ankle about 3 inches, not to high."
4.0,Really Cute Dress!
4.0,"I bought the 6mm for a 6 year old girl, they're prettier than I expected.<br />She loves them!"
4.0,Work well and will probably last a long time but are heavy due to the material type.
4.0,"Very good product; needs to be able to withstand ""wear & tear"" longer."
4.0,These glasses are pretty good for night vision. They were recently put to the test and did pretty well for the price.
4.0,great for the price I paid
4.0,"Love it! Was a little large, but I shrank it and now it's perfect."
4.0,"Made well, looks as advertised."
4.0,"Got these rings for all the girls on my Christmas list. Look great, work great. Just wish they were slightly bigger, dd's fingers got red because the were to tight, but they can wear them on their pinkys."
4.0,"Very comfortable to the skin, it does not irritate the skin"
4.0,Cute.  Fits as expected.  Could have better angled/larger front pockets.
4.0,Great product. Very stylish. Runs a bit small
4.0,Beautiful scalp the size a bit big for my opini√≥n i stayed with the smaller ones. All glory to God.
4.0,I like that these are really soft material. They run a little bit small but not bad. Also I wish the side pockets were just a little bit bigger but they are big enough to hold my phone.
4.0,Very easy to use and read. The color on the insides of the arm band fades a little bit.
4.0,This satchel is attractive.  It works well as a shoulder bag as well.  There is plenty of room inside and enough zipper compartments to be able to separate small items.
4.0,I am a Man of many bandanas.
4.0,Product was well made and fit well.
4.0,I have been searching for the right size back pack to carry photo gear and this pack will fit that purpose. My only concern is how it will hold up on a normal use basis. In the past other packs I used the seams and straps gave out. This pack has the right height for a light weight travel tripod that I needed to carry without it sticking out. There are other separate zippered pockets that are very useful.[[ASIN:B01EL89RTG WASING 50L Ultra Lightweight Water Resistant Packable Backpack Travel Hiking Daypack WS-HK-Black]]
4.0,"Looks like a great quality shirt. Haven't wore it yet, but seems like soft material. I'm pleased with the graphics. Looks like screen print and not iron on which always ends up cracking or peeling off. So it should hold up to the test of time. Looks exactly like pic."
4.0,My son is 8 and this is exactly what he wanted for his birthday. He loves it even though it‚Äôs big around his head and falls down a bit. Great for playing around the house or ignoring me with by putting it on and not answering me‚Ä¶ actually it‚Äôs a little creepy walking around the corner only to find a small child wearing this mask
4.0,"Not going to lie, when I first pulled this out of the box my hubs said, ""you going to bed in that or are you going to enter a boxing match?"" It IS shiny and bright like a boxing uniform üòÑ perfect description. Having said that once on it actually fit pretty well and looks 100% like pajamas. Looks like the photo on. Looks like a boxing uniform off.<br /><br />Why 4 stars not 5?  If 3.8 was an option I'd give it that.  For the price I wasnt expecting luxury silk but the fabric itself is very... I dont know... opposite of breathable. I kept it because it's pretty and different but I only wear it once in a blue moon because the fabric is hard on my skin, especially the pores on my back. Not something I could buy every color of and wear every day not totally fine for a once in a while something-differemt."
4.0,It‚Äôs a really good product like the fabric perfect for the days I want to leave over Night oil on my hair.
4.0,"Fits great,  Keep me warm."
4.0,"I bought these in white, which are gorgeous. These are adorable shoes, and they brighten up any outfit. My daughter enjoys them b/c of the little ladybug appliques. The only thing that keeps me from giving this shoe five stars is that it seems to run a bit narrow (and my daughter has narrow feet!)."
4.0,"This shirt fits true to size. It's longer than usual visually elongating the torso. It's soft, breathable and comfortable to wear. 95% rayon, 5% spandex Good everyday tee."
4.0,"The size is not true to size. I‚Äôm Asian 5‚Äô0 and 115 lbs and medium is still snug for me. Also the zipper are rough so I had to rub Vaseline into into it. Style is flattering and really keep warm. I‚Äôm keeping it because for once the sleeves are just the right length for me.<br /><br />Update: after washing per instruction, the batting on the sleeves separated so I‚Äôm returning this produce instead."
4.0,Three year old daughter loves them. Expensive at $40.
4.0,its a great bargain. i ordered up a size but i prefer the large terry robes one might see in a hotel so i wish i had opted for a bigger size than what i got but super soft and i love it.
4.0,"I purchased these for my two confirmands (confirmation program in church).<br /><br />They're well made, super cute, and they don't pinch, as some similar bracelets have been known to do.<br /><br />I like the message (each little clip on the bracelet has a nice saying) and I encouraged my confirmands to look at them when they're having a bad day or just in general.<br /><br />I will probably make these my yearly gifts for the confirmands. The price is a little high, but they were unique enough that i was deterred by that."
4.0,"I ordered this dress through Amazon prime so it arrived on time without strong chemical odor in plastic appropriate for packaging. I've ordered from this brand before but I forgot to take into account my nursing breast so it fit a little tighter upstairs than expected. My measurements are 42 36 44, I'm 175 lbs at 5'4"" and I ordered a large.  The fabric is strong,  stretchable, and fitting yet forgiving as well as breathable and true to pictured color. I used a petticoat for extra umph, though honestly it's pleating makes it puff out pretty good alone. I didn't iron it so if you don't consider it wrinkled it came that way, I had a steamer in case it was severely wrinkled. This is a good brand so long as you order through the actual vendor Grace Karin. And I will continue to use this vendor"
4.0,"Very happy with this dress. Comfortable, flowy and feels good on."
4.0,"I loved the pendant, but upon arrival I noticed the pendants prayer was written in a different language. Does anyone know what language it is?"
4.0,It‚Äôs definitely a lot thicker and baggier than it looks like on the picture. But very warm and still cute! I love wearing it out and around the house it‚Äôs like being wrapped in a blanket. And it‚Äôs not as itchy as I thought it would be. Pair it with some leggings and a cute boots and you‚Äôve got a nice outfit
4.0,"I purchased this beautiful necklace for myself. I sing this song to my grandchildren and sang it also to my children so this phrase has a special meaning for me. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs shiny, high quality and a perfect length. I give it only 4 stars because when it arrived there was a knot in the end of the chain, which I still am unable to untangle..frustrating."
4.0,Very versatile dress for anyone . It was a bit large but it actually works bc of the design . It can be adjusted to almost any size . Would totally recommend .
4.0,This is big enough to wrap around a few times (size 8). It can be used very sexily as a swimsuit cover up and I've even used it as a hair wrap.
4.0,love these but color is olive and not like picture. It is not a deep forest green. Other than that love them.
4.0,The picture I chose for it was so good that I ordered 2 of them. But it was pretty small and it's very hard to breathe with it on. I ordered them for a Christmas present but it didn't come in for 2 months.
4.0,"Putting the replacement band on was easy but the top part of the band has a slight bump, I tried taking it off to see if there was something stuck underneath. The metal tool doesn't work as well as a knife when taking it off. Bump was still there after I put it back on. As long as the banf doesn't break I'm happy with it though. And I like that it gave replacement screws."
4.0,"Only comment was that the feathers were slightly flat and lifeless, and not as pronounced as the photo.  Otherwise, good size, pronounced bow, good veil coverage, and clips held firmly the entire party."
4.0,Thought they would be larger but they were ok.
4.0,Nice product but only has one size. Seems to only fit small ears. Also It is difficult to get on
4.0,Love the dress but it was a bit looser than I expected and would have been more flattering had it been the slightest bit tighter. It‚Äôs also not too sheer which I was worried about.
4.0,"Very cute, but cheaper looking in person. But I have several and I do wear them. I bought these to give as small gifts."
4.0,Cute but sleeved not as full as they look in photo
4.0,Super cute shirt!! Fits perfectly. Not exactly like the picture but still worth it.
4.0,"Also bigger than I expected, but I still like them and wear them regularly! :) I also have an allergy to certain metals and these don't give me a reaction! :)"
4.0,"Decent quality, fits very snug as it should (so don't adjust your ordering size to smaller, just order your ACTUAL clothing size), but the colors in the pictures are not even close to the real life thing. That one that looks like an awesome shining blue is really super super dark navy. Just be aware."
4.0,I purchased these for my labret piercing originally. I mistakenly got the wrong gauge but tried them anyway. They worked on in my lip but the gems are so small they kept pulling into the piercing hole to be flush with the skin. I got the stainless steel type so they were much too rigid to be comfortable for very long directly under my bottom lip. Now I use them in my cartilage piercing on the top of my ear. They work great up there! The smooth back doesn't hurt my head when I lay on my side in bed so I can actually sleep with them in. I've always had to take my jewelry out of that one before bed so I didn't get poked. I am going to buy the correct gauge of these studs in the silicone (I think that's what the soft type is?) for my labret to see if those work better.
4.0,Buen producto y satisfacci√≥n
4.0,Gorgeous colors- seams look great.<br />The size is a bit large but for the price can be taken in. I would size down.
4.0,Bought as a gift. Have to wait to see reaction of the recipient before giving 5th star.
4.0,Very cute gift for the gal who loves to travel!
4.0,32A is too small for me and 32B is slightly loose for me. This is perfect for me!
4.0,cute :)
4.0,Beautiful bracelet! Wish it would have come in a gift box instead of a plastic bag though!
4.0,Kind of tight around the chest but looks good
4.0,"I like the jacket. It‚Äôs very warm. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the hood is not very manageable. When not using it, it doesn‚Äôt stay back in place. It bothers my neck unless I take it off. Other than that, jacket is very nice and warm. Will recommend to other people to purchase."
4.0,"Nice but too short, and the material is a bit see thru. Im 5‚Äô5."
4.0,These were ordered and sent as a gift so I do not know how well they were liked by the recipient.  They arrived very quickly.
4.0,"Nice watch! Classic look with a postmodern twist. Arrived in almost no time! My only issue is that the hands are the same color as the face/mechanicals, making them somewhat difficult to read. But overall, I am quite satisfied!"
4.0,I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. The only problem was that the end was a bit sharp and scratched the lower part of her belly button. I'm not sure if they're all like that but just cut off a bit of the end and you're good to go.
4.0,Good product and working as advertised &#34;out of the box.&#34;  It was a little larger than expected so this winder needs pride of place on top of a &#34;tall boy valet&#34; as it will not easily fit in a standard drawer.  A
4.0,"Cute hat. Not super thick or sturdy, but held up for what I needed to use it for"
4.0,Fit okay. I just didnt really like the sleeves on the dress. Sent it back and received a quick refund
4.0,"This dress is nice. If you are comparing quality, it is the same as buying a junior's dress from a department store. It is true to size. I would not recommend buying anything bigger other than your normal size. Good for date night, somewhere formal, office party..."
4.0,The price explains the quality but it‚Äôs not bad enough to not wear.
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the fact it didn‚Äôt provide a seal all around. Also beware, no returns"
4.0,"looks just like the pic, nicely made and spider is not too small for my size. Fit is comfy Only complaint is the material is too thin could be see through depending on what you wear underneath."
4.0,"Comfortable and convenient. Carries small amounts of money and ID, as desired. Affordable value."
4.0,I live the top but may have to return for a bigger size I'm usually a medium or large but because I'm 36d may have to go up to a xl
4.0,"Great dress, real comfy and pockets!!"
4.0,"When I ordered these earrings I did not realize that they were so small. Happily I have a friend whose daughter is a nurse and wears small earrings all the time, so I gave them to her. Her daughter was thrilled with them, and wears them all the time, since they are solid sterling silver and don't necessarily scream ""Christmas!"""
4.0,This was adorable but it ran small. Wish I had known.
4.0,Loved details but wish fairy was a little bigger.
4.0,"beautiful but not enough belt holes. just bought a hole puncher, they are really inexpensive."
4.0,I don't think it will last very long but it looks really great on me.  It feels like I am wearing a comfortable house dress at work :)
4.0,Our daughter loved it and placed it on her desk. Everybody was stopping to admire it.
4.0,Love the weight of the shoe and color. The shoe fits wide if you have a narrow or slim feet be ware.
4.0,It is Beautiful and soft with just the right thickness
4.0,Material too fine.
4.0,Beautiful fit.  Nice colors.  Lots of compliments.  Wish I'd known the back was so low.
4.0,"I got the US size 12. I am 5""10.5 and weight around 185sih maybe a few pounds more. I wore this dress to a wedding. The good: the dress was a pretty champagne gold. The length was good, just below my ankle so you could see a little bit of my shoes. Do NOT get this dress if you are over 5""11, more than 200 pounds or if you are shorter than 5'8 (you might have to get it fixed). I am a B cup so if you are more than a C this will fit tight. I did not wear a bra with this but just in case I recommend fashion tape. The dress is a A- line and it  can be very forgiving if you are carrying a few extra pounds  around your hip or if you have a bigger butt. The not so good (taking one start for these): the fabric under the arms was a little scratchy. Also be careful with the fabric, it almost got snagged a few times. The dress I received came quite wrinkled so you  might have to iron it before wearing it. Not the most comfortable dress if you are trying to dance the night away...but for the price Id get it. PS: the dress does not look ""prom"" so you can wear it to grown up events without looking like a prom queen."
4.0,Nice looking top made of a soft fleecy material.
4.0,For me the XL ran slightly large in arms length but pretty perfect otherwise and I just flip the cuff. I might hand sew a couple small pieces of elastic to tighten the cuffs so they are not so floppy. Its so comfy and as flattering as can be for a big girl in an XL sweater. Feels dressy or casual can go either way. I really love this!
4.0,"A little thin so it may be see through. Otherwise, it is lovely."
4.0,"It is so cute but within putting it on the shoulder strap popped so I had to adjust it right away by tearing the other one as well. It did not look bad, but now it looks like it fits pretty big from the shoulders.  Other than that it is a very nice dress, I used it when I went on vacations to D.C. with some nice sandals, lots of compliments."
4.0,Reordered a smaller size and the armholes still gaped.  Very pretty if your handy with a meddle and thread.
4.0,"This color (Fusion) is not quite like it appears in the product photo. The actual product is a deep yellow-gold color with a slight tinge of green. I will attach a photo of the actual lenses to this review when I get a chance.<br />Other than that, installation was a breeze and lens quality seems excellent so far."
4.0,"These are nice glasses.  The lenses have a nice amber tint and they do in fact float (fell off my head into a pool the first day I got them).  They do fit a little large, so if you're buying them for kiddos or if you have a small head, you may have to manipulate the shape a little.  They are also remarkably light weight."
4.0,"These earrings are a very pretty dark blue/green zircon. The gold is a snake which is not my usual style, but unless you look closely, it just looks like pretty gold. They are not too heavy and very pretty."
4.0,"Nice one piece bathing suit. looks like a little summer dress and provides good coverage. Did not like the underwire, they were digging into underarms so I removed. Much better now. Really no need for underwire in a bathing suit. It has enough support without them. Shorts underneath is a nice feature but they do ride up. Overall happy with this purchase."
4.0,True to picture.  Very satisfied.
4.0,"I bought a large cause I'm a DD, the top was to small but the bottoms fit"
4.0,I think this is nice it would be nice and others may love it.
4.0,"good product, size was accurate and printing was solid."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  Will be traveling soon and wanted a lightweight bag to pack in my larger suitcase to be able to bring back souvenirs.  Folds up small and compact.  Not the highest quality fabric, but it will definitely serve its intended purpose."
4.0,"This robe is really soft and lightweight, very happy with it with the exception of the belt/ribbon around the waist. I wish it was the same material of the robe instead of the very slippery material of the ribbon that becomes undone too easily"
4.0,This the best hoodie I ever had and I get lots of compliments but I thought the pink was just like the picture instead it's bright pink
4.0,"I‚Äôm short and chubby. I ordered a women‚Äôs size large which is my normal size and they‚Äôre big on me. They‚Äôre baggy in the crotch area, they fall about an inch below my knees and there‚Äôs way too much room in the waist. However, they‚Äôre really comfortable and the material is nice. I just roll them at the waist and tie them and they‚Äôre fine. They‚Äôre not overly flattering but I just wanted them for lounging around the house so that‚Äôs not a big deal. I plan to order more but I think I‚Äôll order down a size. I see they now also have some with a shorter inseam so I may try those as well because they really are a comfortable material. Overall, I like them and they serve their purpose."
4.0,Well made. 50c size
4.0,"I got this as a gift.  I haven't worn it yet.  However, it is a beautiful bracelet.  One thing - the picture description is not quite accurate.  It did not come with the two eye beads at the end of the strings.  It may have been that way at the beginning but not now."
4.0,Not a 5 star review just because they are hard to fold and unfold and one is already tearing at the seam.
4.0,"The fabric on this was okay. It would be good for working out, but wouldn't wear it otherwise probably. It is nice that it can help with the moisture. I didn't love the feel of it that much, but I think that also might be a measure of personal preference. It's pretty stretchy which is good, but of course it is fitted so size accordingly. The quality seemed fine. It would work for layering because of the shape. The color was pretty and looked like the picture. I thought the look was okay. Overall, a reasonable option."
4.0,This is larger than I expected (I didn't read the specs on it when I bought it) so I was very excited when I opened the package!
4.0,"I love the dress!  I paired it with a denim vest and it looks great.  I am a solid 4x but the dress a little tight.  Also, I am 5'4"" and it's about 3 inches too long.  It drags on the ground.  Due to this I'm going to have to get it hemmed."
4.0,Nice kundan earrings. Adds an extra bit of gorgeousness to the face.
4.0,I Bought 1 Size Larger And It's Great. Very stylish and comfortable
4.0,"It is very large, even big on my angel."
4.0,This one is very nice except It's just much larger than it looks in the picture and the urn itself is much smaller than I expected.
4.0,Works okay
4.0,"Great color. Comfortable fit. Love the pockets.<br />The one down side is that they are SO fitted that you can see the lines/shape of EVERYTHING through the fabric - as in, you can see the cellulite & details in lace undies."
4.0,"I bought this dress in purple, and absolutely loved it."
4.0,"I really like this earring and have been receiving compliments. It's well made, sturdy, and has a golden earring lift, which I appreciate, because I hate plastic or rubber ones. The only reason why I've taken off a star is that it's slightly too small, but that doesn't cause any problems for me as I wear it a lot."
4.0,"Fits perfectly, fabric is surprisingly good for the price. It fits close to the body, but not super tight, and looks exactly as pictured. No complaints."
4.0,Adjustable buttons.  The buttons were easy to assemble just use a wire to get elastic through.
4.0,It was alright. Not too flattering but comfy
4.0,"I have enjoyed this shirt. I like that it is a V neck, and not a bright or loud color. I will say that the material does shrink when you wash and dry it."
4.0,just like the picture a bit smaller than size looks like the Disney princess from the little mermaid
4.0,Very nice way to carry an extra ball or accessory bag.
4.0,Color is a bit darker in reality
4.0,Looks nice and have held up well
4.0,"This watch is very water resistant and practical. I've taken it in the shower, a spring, and a pool and had no problems. Two things I don't like is how it feels and how easily the date switches on its own. The wrist part is made of of a material that kind of sticks to you like your skin does to certain fabrics on a hot summer day. It's really irritating to me, but I'm sensitive to that. My solution has been to wear it as loose as possible. A more annoying problem is that that the day of the week and date keep changing themselves. I think the button gets pressed as I am moving about. This is bad if you think it's one day and its actually not. I usually catch it and correct it, but that facilitates the need for a phone which contradicts the whole reason why I bought the watch, to not use my phone. I think you get what you pay for and it's fine if you need a watch for the most basic purpose of time. I have not found a need for the other functions, but they seem easy enough to work after you read the instruction manual. I have had the watch for about a month and it's already a bit scratched up. I think that's okay, but it goes to show that it is not that resilient."
4.0,Overall a good Tie.  Looks smooth and does not wear out quickly.  The matching pocket square and cuff links are a very nice addition.
4.0,"Very nice looking shirt.  I bought a xxl for my 6'3&#34; husband, and wish it were a tad larger."
4.0,It is hard to get my iPhone 11 in the case and I have to push hard to n my ale the buttons work. I can‚Äôt see the top of the phone screen.
4.0,"This is a Lovely Dress, but it was too small. I was sad that I had to return it."
4.0,"This dress is very flattering and comfortable but I definitely agree that you need to size up when ordering. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 210 lb with an athletic build and typically wear a large but ordered an XL based on the reviews and I am glad I did. Fits just right. Would recommend!"
4.0,"Credit card slots are somewhat tight, but I hope they'll stretch over time. Leather is easy to mark/scratch, but I don't mind it."
4.0,It was a really cute shirt I bought a medium for my eight year old.It fits more like her 6x shirts.Its a little small.
4.0,"These are great, but I have 4 stars only because they're quite large on my face. The lenses are a great size, but the space between the ear pieces is a little too much. They're wonderful, though, as long as I don't bend over... They fall off if I do that. =p"
4.0,I like these but wish they were tighter at the top.  They are real tight at the knee but start getting looser at mid thigh and continue to get looser through the hips.
4.0,Nice shirt!  Fits well and comes in good colors.
4.0,"Very cute bag! The only things that would make it better in my opinion are silver hardware instead of gold and the stripes are not lined up exactly from front to back. The &#34;leather&#34; material is nice and soft and the colors are pretty. I like it, for this price it is pretty awesome."
4.0,"It's a nice top for what it cost. Doesn't feel cheap. I don't care for the string too much, that's the only part that looks cheap. Cool and comfortable though."
4.0,I love this set. Very comfortable.
4.0,"This is a nice bag but if you're on the smaller side as a person then it won't look as good if wearing it in front of you. It looks nice on your back but it looks kinda awkward in front of you are smaller in size. The bag is spacious and can pretty much fit anything, it has two nice little pockets in front and the two mains ones located on each side of the bag. It is a nice bag just to big for smaller people to wear from the front."
4.0,"I would be happy to write a review but feel I cannot address how the sleeper fits because the sleeper was bought as a gift for a baby shower.  The baby has not yet received the gift and has not been born yet.  I do think the sleeper is very attractive and seems to be of nice quality.  Since I am giving it as a gift in a week, I haven't even removed it from the package."
4.0,Watch the size. They are smaller than you‚Äôd think. I wish I could exchange them but I wore one. Too tight for comfort. Although they seem comfortable material and dry easily.
4.0,"Cool and comfortable fabric. Nicely made. Looks great. Wore just like the picture, white top and jacket."
4.0,"Gorgeous color blue. Fits perfect and is flattering. I'm 5'6"" 215 lbs, DD.  Cotton is soft and stretchy and feels wonderful to wear. My only complaint is I wore it before washing. Within a couple of hours, the neckline lost its elasticity and began to sag some. I'm hoping it doesn't get worse. This is a much nicer item than those shifts they sell,  and I hope they correct whatever is happening to the neckline. It's amazing otherwise. Recommend this with some reservations."
4.0,"The first set was not great quality, but was easy to return and get a new set. Not sure how long these will last with regular use, but the do help the fact that most other bands make my skin breakout...."
4.0,Everything was as expected. Fast service.
4.0,"This is the biggest shirt like this that I bought, however, it is well made and warm. I love it!! It pairs great with a bralette. I have received many compliments on it."
4.0,"I think the price is really awesome for what you get. The only issue I have is it's a little too long in my nose that it keeps stabbing the inside of my nose. Not too comfortable, but honestly it looks so good otherwise I think I'm gonna just cut it down a bit so it don't keep stabbing me. It's not too big, I don't like bulk on my nose, and it's small enough my job has no complains, yet it's big enough to be seen and look simple yet elegant. So even with the issue of stabbing, ID say it's still worth buying, just be prepared to clip it down alittle."
4.0,I liked it. I was a gift for a young girl who likes unicorns so it was perfect.
4.0,Very cute shirt. very plain
4.0,My granddaughter loved it. This was a birthday present
4.0,"I'm 5'7"", 135lb, 29"" waist, 38"" hip. According to the size chart, my waist puts me at a size 7, but my hips are size 5. I went with size 7x34 and wish I would've sized down. I washed and dried on hot to try to shrink but not much shrinkage occurred. I would recommend going by your HIP size. These are your traditional thick jeans, so you'll need a belt. They aren't stretchy. They are looser by the end of the day. I'm pleased with quality but disappointed with my size choice."
4.0,"It would be perfect if I either lost fifty pounds or got a larger size‚Ä¶ but I got the largest size. I usually fit at a large jacket and I got an extra large because the description suggested to go larger. Oh well, I can still wear it or if I get too bothered by it, I can give it to a friend."
4.0,No Issues
4.0,"This is a nice over-layer however, when I tried it on, I noticed one of the sleeves was not sewn properly, one section was missed when stitching. I will be returning and ordering a different one. Besides the stitching, the fit was great. I bought a large. I am 5'2&#34; and 150lbs. I weight lift so this was not necessarily a loose layer; I personally would not wear a long sleeve shirt underneath. It fit me perfect over a cami."
4.0,I am 5.4  fits  perfectly. Need to wear a tight undergarment to make it smooth.
4.0,"It's cool and holds time when it's working right, the second hand hangs up on the minute hand around the 45 minute marker"
4.0,"this is a really cute top, fit is perfect, design is great.  just a word of warning:  it is very sheer.  the back is lace & that's great.  the front is a little darker, but it's still pretty sheer.  personally, i love this...but others may not & it's hard to tell from the image posted."
4.0,Great for handling run away kids plus they can have freedom by just taking off strap. The spray is small for my wrist though (and I have tiny wrist) also the holders on the side are very small. Like maybe a toy car can fit small. Still love it though.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter in law for Easter, it looks of good quality for the price, very pleased."
4.0,"The first thing that struck me about this bag was that it was very nicely packaged. It is clear the company cares to deliver their product in good condition to the customer. This bag is very cool and very simple to open. Simply unzip and you have a full sized duffle bag! I filled this with some clothes and it certainly holds a lot (more than the average duffle bag in my opinion) but the only thing I noticed is that it lacks structure a bit. As in, my clothes seemed to all fall towards the middle and wouldn't stay folded. This, of course, is not a deal breaker. It has a nice padded shoulder strap that makes it easy to carry. There is a variety of zip pockets. I also tried refolding it after I opened it up (I figured that might be tough) and it was actually quite simple. It took me a few minutes to get everything tucked in and it zipped around, but considering how much space it saves, it was well worth it. I couldn't get it to refold as thin as it was when it first arrived, but it was still very compact for such a large back. As a college student, this would have been the perfect bag for traveling to and from school, since dorms are often small and hiding things like a suitcase is VERY difficult. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the fact that it seems to lack stability.<br /><br />*I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
4.0,I ordered this for my pregnant daughter. She really enjoy it plus I ordered myself one for my self with 2 babybears on it !!
4.0,"Given this to a lady who loves roses and her favorite color is chocolate, so this was a perfect combination. She was very happy when she opened her present."
4.0,I bought this thinking it had a light on it but it is just glow in the dark.  Bought it for my daughter but she still likes it.
4.0,Got them in 4 days.For the price these are great. Not super huge and a variety of colors. Took one star off because one pair was scratched up.
4.0,"Cool, feminine, romatic, comfortable. Good"
4.0,"Awesome fit! Can‚Äôt wait to try more clothing put out by you guys in the future. Been looking for nice fitting clothes since I gained a few pounds and this absolutely did the trick. I full acknowledge that this shirt was made to fit YOUR BODY comfortably, hence this ain‚Äôt gunna make you look like THOR lol only diet and exercise can do that :)"
4.0,The dress is perfect length. I am 5‚Äô2 and it‚Äôs perfect. Only thing is I will need to ware a black tank underneath Because of the fabric being a bit see through. Overall like the dress!
4.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but the top part just has really heavy lace. This dress wasn't for me, but depending on what you're looking for, it may be perfect."
4.0,"i use them in the lake, they kinda feel like they are going to pull your eyes out it has such good suction. I think some rainx would help see better to keep water off the lens."
4.0,It is a heavy but it is a metal band. Works well.
4.0,"I really love these. They are cute, and they didn‚Äôt turn my fingers green, I gave it four starts because a diamond fell out as soon as I got them out of the box and tried them on, but a little bit of glue can fix that so I wasn‚Äôt really worried. I hope they create more styles."
4.0,"The dress is a great fit but the color isn't as bright and vibrant as the picture. The chest is super tight but I have super big chest so what can I say. Also, I am keeping the dress anyway and just have it altered. I was thinking of adding a lace panel in the back but my mom suggested I buy a whole new dress. So yes, I will buy another dress just to widen the bust of the current dress. I really like this item a lot."
4.0,The extra bulk of these pants over my normal snowboarding pants was worth it for the extra warmth. The fabric held up well in rough conditions while I was ice climbing.
4.0,I‚Äôm normally a small but ordered a large after reading reviews. They fit great although I feel like an extra long may have been a better fit. Overall happy with them as I think the two of them together were like $6.
4.0,Bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He really likes it so far.
4.0,üëç nice jeans
4.0,"Very comfortable! I have a very large bust and maybe I got the wrong size (ordered XL), but it didn‚Äôt cover as much under the armpit area as I would‚Äôve liked. Better lift than other bras I‚Äôve tried, but definitely didn‚Äôt make them perky :-) I like wearing it around the house or to run a quick errand."
4.0,Love this shirt but it runs a little small. Still going to wear it but would have liked it to have been more of a looser fit.
4.0,"Sturdy, durable,  only negative is that it doesnt fit a 16in laptop in the padded pocket of the bag, but otherwise very happy with the bag. Also, no pen holder. Looks nice as well!"
4.0,Bought for new granddaughter (who was just born).  nice shoes with soft elastic strap
4.0,I iove them the way they look.  I have a hard time getting them pushed together and am afraid that I will lose them.  I wore them and lost one but luckily found it. Trying to figure<br />out how I can get them on to stay and not have to worry about losing one.
4.0,Really cool ring. Gothic like.
4.0,"The watch works just fine but it is small, making the readout a little more difficult. The watch band is plastic and too short for a larger wrist. While it is not labeled as a ladies watch it is better used on a person with smaller wrists. I would buy it for its features but I would not buy it again for its size"
4.0,"Nice material and color, but runs big and has weird unattractively sewn edges. I am a 5' 4‚Äù, size 2, and was swimming in the small. I may hem it in and take about four inches off the whole garment, but considering just returning because the round cut will be a challenge to hem."
4.0,Soft material. Good fit.
4.0,"It's a cute piece, but it started to turn after a bit. I wouldn't suggest wearing it for longer than a day at a time."
4.0,"This dress is funky and so cute but very short., so very very sexy"
4.0,Love her...‚Ä¶..love how the umbrella twirls. Not too difficult to trigger which is great. Love the volume control too! Rod doesn't hold in her head too well but that is minor. I like the robust stand she is on. Did take more work to put together than other dolls but not a big deal.
4.0,a nice shirt
4.0,Decent cheap belt.
4.0,Very comfortable and lightweight beanie. Not as warm as I would have thought due to the thinner material.
4.0,"Material is so soft, love them,"
4.0,Perfect for summer air conditioning but does run small. Hope color stays after washing
4.0,"As a college student, I use vera bradley zip ID cases to hold my school ID, my drivers license, some cash, and a few credit cards in the pocket.  I hook my two keys on the outside.  These wallets are the perfect size for pockets and with a lanyard can be carried around easily on the wrist.  The only reason that I deduct a star is that with heavy use you may have to replace the wallet about every six months due to holes in the bottom from wear.  I can handle relatively frequent replacement though because I use this as my only &#34;purse&#34; when I have my backpack with."
4.0,This sweatshirt is packaged and delivered on time.  The material is not the fleece I was expecting but it still looks great on me.  It was suppose to be for my daughter but since it ran small it‚Äôs a gift to myself.
4.0,"Super cute! Very pretty bikini and seems good and durable quality. I ordered a size M which is my true size but the bottoms pretty tight, so I would advice to order one size larger than your usual size. Wore it on vacation this weekend and really liked it. Overall a good buy!"
4.0,"The package arrived Fast  ,<br />I liked the concept, design and the fur BUT it feels like it‚Äôs created only for petite sizes. The waist is high and it feels uncomfortable . I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù tall and bought size s . Returned,"
4.0,"It's the most gorgeous wallet any Zelda fan could ask for, but the pockets seem to annoyingly be just a few millimeters too short width-wise to easily fit cards/IDs into. Jamming my stuff in is more of a hassle than it should be.<br /><br />The perfet wallet would be this, but just a tad bigger and maybe with a second large pocket behind the cash."
4.0,Would have worked but didn‚Äôt come in time for my costume so I returned
4.0,"My wife loves this shirt! However, she's a small in everything. This shirt is an XXL that fit her. You've been warned."
4.0,I really like the bathing suit.
4.0,Shipping was fast and it fit great
4.0,"Cute necklace...has a vintage feel to it. I did think the stone would be a little larger. But, overall, definitely worth the price."
4.0,The bracelet is really pretty. I can't wait to give it to my Maid of Honor.
4.0,Bought 4 pair and live them so much. Priced right. Easy to care for compact and light
4.0,Bigger than i expected but i love them
4.0,The watch keeps reseting it self several times a day ... i cant give it 5 stars
4.0,Cute underwear but shrunk a bit when we washed them in warm water. Very soft but the colors faded after a few washes.
4.0,Lovely little summer dress was  purchased  for an upcoming  cruise. Price was affordable.
4.0,"The belt does its job and being made of flexible material it feels good. Also doesn't need to cut pieces of it to fit which I really like. However, the micro adjustment is really hard as the material is hard to move through the buckle. Hence the 4 stars."
4.0,Received these as a Mother‚Äôs Day gift. I love them.
4.0,This was a wonderful addition to my closet.  Really helped get things together in one place.  Cut down on the &#34;hunt time&#34; for my glasses and watches.  Great organizational tool.
4.0,Very comfortable.Ran really big .So I washed in warm water and dried in the dryer.Nice summer nightgown or lounging gown.I wear a extra small Junior size 1.So I knew it would be big.But still a 4 star dress.
4.0,"This Kimono is beautiful but for some reason I thought I ordered a 3x, but they only go up to 2X.  It doesn't quite fit but I'm in the process of dropping weight so I will get into it eventually."
4.0,It looks great as long as I roll the sleeves up :) Runs small
4.0,"I've been ""field testing"" these glasses for the past 6 months. It's taken that long because I try not to drive at night! When my cataracts were fixed, I opted for the ""multifocal"" lens implants so I'd have ""normal"" bifocal vision. They DID warn me that the downside of these techie implants is that at night, one is essentially blinded by glare from oncoming headlights. I pushed ahead anyway and got the implants, but alas it was all too true about the glare. I got some ordinary amber night glasses--no go. Then I got some really dark amber glasses--no go. Then I saw these: POLARIZED night driving glasses! I've used polarized sunglasses exclusively for decades to reduce glare, so I had to try these. THEY DO WORK!! If I simply have no choice but to drive somewhere at night, I can do it. It's not perfect--so only 4 stars. But anyone with the same kind of lens implants that I have will know how impossible night driving became when they got their implants. I say: try these. They reduce the glare enough to let me drive around my neighborhood (where I know all the streets and turns). I still wouldn't go someplace I'm not familiar with, where seeing totally clearly is critical, but they have given me back a certain amount of my independence. I'm also training myself to look slightly to my right at the curbside or white line or lane line so the headlights are a wee bit off my line of sight."
4.0,"It fits small through the arms... But it works with just a t-shirt under it,"
4.0,"Love my new suit!!  Fits great and very pleased with quality.  I'm 5'10&#34;, 140 pounds and ordered a medium. The top lining is off, it comes up a little high.  I also took out the breast pads, they were a little funky but we're easy to pull out."
4.0,My boyfriend love it. It's in good conditions after 6 months. I recomended
4.0,This is a cheap apron. The quality of the material isn‚Äôt the best but hey that‚Äôs what happens when you buy a cheap one. Does she job for sure.
4.0,"These toe socks fit well and are comfortable.  I've only used injinji before and these are a decent less expensive alternative.<br /><br />These socks seem to be getting a little fuzzy (worn) after 3 washings, but they still work"
4.0,Absolutely love this dress! It fits perfectly and everyone at work loves it!
4.0,I like that it fit like it‚Äôs suppose to. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"These shoes are cute and I like the coral color!  However, the front of the shoe is really long.  I'm not sure how to describe the fit....but the toe area is long and skinny.  They are comfy though."
4.0,Kid loves them.
4.0,Love the color although it wasn‚Äôt the yellow On the pic.  But my daughter loves it.
4.0,"they're really pretty and I have rec'd compliments on them.  However, that large stone closest to her face is not  true.<br />the wire is very flimsy and I'm expecting them to break.  they are hard to keep on the lobe.....  (maybe I'm doing something wrong?)  very pretty earrings."
4.0,"Update 3/1 -  So after trying the prototype gloves being fingerless I had a better experience using the gloves since there was less stickiness to playing on an arcade stick and a controller. The full hand glove I can say works best for keyboard and mouse play and if you want a little more compression on your hands and to keep them less sweaty. Though they do help a bit with keeping your hands from getting cold they are not a full hand warming solution obviously since they are trying to keep you from sweat. All in all in the end with the great customer service and a second look at the glove especially the fingerless ones which I hope gamer gloves implements as an option in the future this is a nice accessory to have for long gaming stretches. Though it may not be for everyone I would still say give it a chance.<br /><br />Update 2/10 - After my last review the manufacturer got back with me and actually asked if I could test another version of the gloves and send it to me to give it another shot. I'll be testing these out and post another review soon. For the time being I'm going to raise my rating for the great customer service Gamer Gloves is providing.<br /><br />Just got these gloves a while ago and in about a week the seams on the index finger tore. I have since returned them, but before that issue the only thing about the gloves I liked was the compression, it felt nice and and did keep my hand from cramping and getting tired from a long gaming session. The downside is the grips are to sticky especially the thumbs. If your trying to do motions on a d-pad say for fighting games your moves don't come out right. For FPS on a controller this is ok but not great. They should have made these gloves fingerless, would have been a better design choice. All in all your better off using fingerless arthritis gloves then these gloves."
4.0,Well constructed and looks good.l thought l could tighten them and resolve the1/2 size too big issue but was wrong.Should have ordered size10 and returned these...waited too long.
4.0,"This shirt is soft and fits as expected, with a little flare at the bottom. The only surprise is the sleeves are a little baggy, not fitted like I thought. Good quality material though."
4.0,Difficult to slide out  new rubber ends but looks great in would recommend using a silicon spray or other desolving lubricant to aid in slipping on the frame
4.0,She says it's very warm
4.0,You get what you pay for. The graphics are underwhelming but your not going to get designer quality at this price. The slide fit well into the watch. The bands are very stiff. So overall okay but I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to last long before it starts to crack.
4.0,Very nice. It is very fine. Be sure you know what 1mm size is. It was even more petite than I even expected.
4.0,"Sizing is kinda weird and the sizing chart is a bit off, but overall I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,I 've had this for a day and am impressed with look and quality. However it is the same watch as Julius JA-577M also being sold on Amazon for $17.95. So why buy this one?
4.0,"The shirt is very sheer, but fits as expected. The print is adorable and it's quite comfy"
4.0,Prefect fit.<br />Zero issues to complain
4.0,"Okay, so I didn't know if I should choose ""somewhat small"" or ""fit as expected."" I guess it has to be both seeing as since it is a bodysuit it is extremely form-fitting. I am 5'7"" and about 150 pounds but I can still breathe perfectly fine (it's form-fitting, but not tight if that makes any sense at all). This item is comfortable and flattering to my shape. The material is not see-through but I wouldn't recommend wearing anything too extravagant underneath because you can see the imprint of it a little bit. I guess the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the snap does scratch against the insides of my legs when I walk which is a bit uncomfortable but nothing I can't deal with. Overall this is a nice item of clothing and is so cute with my new maxi skirt!"
4.0,I ordered an XL and normally am a medium-large. This fits slightly loose but the sleeves are a little short. For the price I'm happy with it though.
4.0,"Like any apparel from China the size conversion chart must be followed, dont blame the seller if you cant read. It needs a power pack purchased separately,  again dont blame the seller if you cant read. Jacket works as advertised"
4.0,"The product is wonderful, wish maybe it was a little bigger, but will work out great!"
4.0,The bands are great and they‚Äôre comfortable to use but they‚Äôre a little in the small side. It‚Äôs a standard band size but it would have been better if they came in standard and longer.
4.0,"This is really a nice dress, just wish they had extra small."
4.0,"Everything was great, didn‚Äôt use the tattoo , the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the wand started peeling right away , didn‚Äôt allow baby to play with it because he wants to put everything in his mouth"
4.0,"One down side is the pattern skull. Due to the draw string, can setup the face without the eye sockets. The stock pictures are not feasible, unless you take the draw string out. I used to mow my lawn and do a BBQ, and now it smells like smoke all day. Quick hand wash with dawn fixed that. But now I see pink dots across the teeth."
4.0,"It's a great style, the plus size was just too big.  I returned it and got an XL regular women's in another print."
4.0,"I ordered this to use it as a cartilage piercing hoop. i have been searching for a metal that doesn't irritate my ears and I've been wearing this for one day with no problems. it's easy to bend and get in and out. It did start irritating me, so I had to stop wearing it. If I can find it, I'll put a layer of clear nail polish on it and maybe start wearing it again."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for in an affordable men's wrist watch. It keeps very accurate time and has the day of the week and the day of the month, side-by-side on the right side of the clock face. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating was that it came in the mail with no instructions on how to set the day/date function . Fortunately, other customers who had encountered the same problem, explained how they learned, by pulling out the knob & turning it both directions to set the day/date. The manufacturer should have enclosed the instructions to do that! How much would a small instruction sheet cost the manufacturer anyway?"
4.0,Love these! My favor color and they look great on my chest!
4.0,"The pattern and the quality were great.  However the top is not adjustable in any way, no clasp or string to loosen or tighten.  The band around was too large for me (I'm a 34 in a bra and ordered a Medium) and couldn't be adjusted.  Super cute suit and I hated to send it back!"
4.0,"Theses were very nice and as described and the shipping was very fast but they were bigger than the picture and too big for my face, other than that they were very nice."
4.0,"Has enough room, Slightly see through but other than that it is a nice product."
4.0,I love this bracelet and have made the phrase kind of my life motto ‚Äú be stronger than the storm‚Äù. During these tough times it‚Äôs very nice to be able to look down to be reminded of my inner strength.
4.0,"Fit was great, just wish the material was a little bit more breathable."
4.0,"Cute handbag, thought it was a bit bigger, but not a problem, holds what I need it too including a large wallet. Ordered beige but it has kind of a pinkish hue to it. All in all it is quite a classy looking bag."
4.0,"Love this band. Barely feels like I have a watch on. Light weight, cute color... hope it lasts awhile."
4.0,"Great, beautiful quality.  It fits everywhere except that part of the arms where it flares out - which seems to be common with these types of dresses and my arm circumference.  So I can't wear it yet but I'm holding out hope that I will eventually so I'm hanging onto it.  Cuz it's that pretty."
4.0,So it‚Äôs cheaply made- I‚Äôll be careful washing it so the lace sleeves don‚Äôt shred. And I ordered 2 sizes up BUT I get sooo many compliments on this shirt. It‚Äôs a great shirt to dress up or down.
4.0,"These are quite good for their price.  The sole is strong and sticky, a bit like the bottom of K**n standals -- which is very good and close to optimal in my opinion.  The sandals look good and are water resistant if not waterproof.  My only knock is I don't love the way the feel on my foot -- primarily because I don't like the ""between the toes"" design.  But that's really more my problem than a problem with the product.  If you like that kind of sandal design, and you are looking for a rugged and functional sandal for not a lot of money, you will like these.  I take a 9.5 in shoes, and ordered a 9 in these, and I'm pleased with the size and fit."
4.0,"I returned these boots because they were not as snug around my ankle as I had hoped or expected. At the front of my ankle there was a 1-2&#34; gap. They were too wide for my leg as well. I am over 5'8&#34; tall and @ 135 pounds with slender legs and narrow feet, I have trouble finding footwear that is not wide."
4.0,My only pet peeve is that it's not as white as it appears. Because it's an actual tie dye the black appears a little bit like a gray green in places. I paired it with black leggings and a black short sleeve cardigan. Perfect for my business casual office.
4.0,"This is super comfy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, wish it were just a little longer. Quality was fine."
4.0,like the thinness
4.0,"Nice size and length for the necklace.  The latch is a pain, though.  It screws together and it is really difficult to attach together.  It even fell off once when I thought I had it screwed together correctly, when I really didn't.  Love the necklace, hate the latching mechanism."
4.0,They are cute and great for the little girls that call us Grandpa and Grandma. I am glad that I bought these
4.0,"idk if they're 100% real sheepskin, but they are cozy"
4.0,"This is a great shirt in appearance and feel, and I love the design. However, a button fell off the shirt the first day I wore it....easy fix though."
4.0,It's a really  nice looking belt.
4.0,"Sturdy material that has a great, solid feel. Fits exactly as I expected, true to the size (L) of a similar Ralph Lauren I was replacing."
4.0,"Comfortable and Practical , they have to adjust the size measurement little bet"
4.0,"Loved it, although not for one with big boobs lol"
4.0,"Super light and colorful, but do look pretty cheap"
4.0,Love the design. Fits great. But it is white on the inside. That make it seem cheap to me.
4.0,"Nice but not enough tummy control for me so I returned them. Great quality and almost kept them bc I am in the loosing weight stage. But l'll just look for something else. So, there's a little support for those of you who don't need a lot of support. Great price for 2"
4.0,The only issue I have with ths dress is that it gets pills like a sweater. I've never had a dress do that but I happened just from wearing it.
4.0,i got the black ones and they fit/block out as much sun as any other $5 sunglasses. they're a little warped but other than that they fit fine.
4.0,Details of pendant are beautiful but I'm not as impressed with the chain. My niece loved this necklace.
4.0,Size large fits a little large and im about a size m to large 8-10. But overall the style is flattering and the material is decent.
4.0,"I like these earrings, but they are quite small. It would be good to have them modeled in the picture so people can tell what they are getting."
4.0,Will have to wear a black or tan colored bra under this too the material is thin. I would buy again for the price
4.0,"Purchased these for my sister that dances in plays.All I have to say is THANK YOU,She fell in love with these huge wings before arrival.Just one thing,She did not receive any free stickers but she didn't care as all she wanted was the wings.Thank You (Do you think that you could send the stickers separately since were kind of curious of how they look)But if not possible its ok."
4.0,This bracelet was GORG!  The stones will reflect whatever color you decide to wear.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a little big on my wrist (for the record I have small wrist) but every time I squeezed it to fit it still wasn't snug.
4.0,Ordered these boots for winter/spring as I am expecting and was having issues with my other shoes. These have some room but are not too loose or tight. Only taking away one star as they are snug for when wiggling on but once on they are great! I have plantar fasciitis that comes and goes and no issues wearing these all day.
4.0,"This is an awesome wallet! The strap make it very easy to get my most used cards out with ease! The only complaint is the money clip seems to want to slip out, but it's not a deal breaker."
4.0,"These are cute for the wearer. Small stones and would appear as a speck on your noses. However, if you've worn a larger gauge nose ring, you might not want this one!!"
4.0,"It's a nice bracelet for a guy, decent size and look, sturdy too"
4.0,I order the size I would normally wear and it ran a bit big...but the quality is amazing and they look awesome.  Next time I'll order a size down.
4.0,Cute earrings. Not as heavy as they look to be.
4.0,"Everything is good about it except the waist is a little high on me, it covers up the belly button and it is slim so I get a bit of a muffin top."
4.0,She loves it but it‚Äôs way to tight. I will need to customize it for her.
4.0,The print is great. It hides any lumps or bumps. I am usually skeptical of white dresses because they are usually a bit see through but this one is not. I am 5' 3&#34; and 135 pounds. 36 D chest. I ordered a small. It fits well but it still seems a tiny bit big. The bottom isn't as tight as I'd like it to be for a pencil dress but it is still great for work.
4.0,They for great! Just a little stiff. They need to be broken in a bit and I think they will be fine.
4.0,"These feel and look great. First pair broke after about a week of wear but the second pair I‚Äôve worn 24/7 for a few months now and they‚Äôre still going strong, maybe just bad quality for the first pair. Definitely recommend. Also good for sensitive ears, not irritated at all"
4.0,Amazing! Real wood!!!
4.0,"When I first put them on the seemed way too small, but with wear they seemed to grow into their potential. They fit comfortably and are nice and soft. The band is not too tight and allow for breathing. I would not order larger because 12 was the right size, just needed some breaking into."
4.0,"I love the length, the front is a little off. It's like they sowed two butts together. But the pattern is cute, not too short , medium fit perfectly"
4.0,"These leggings are so soft and warm. They will be great for a Kansas winter. My daughter is 7 but tall for her age so I ordered up, size 8Tall. They fit good around the waist but are still a little short. Fixable by wearing boots with them. I only gave them 4 stars because they should be longer for the size."
4.0,"I loved the pattern, The small fits a little big in my opinion, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 139 lbs and the waists is a bit loose.  the fabric is a thinner type, not as much compression that I like but they are cute and I‚Äôll wear them for a change."
4.0,I really like he size and shape of this bag- the leather is very stiff and it had a strange oder-
4.0,wish it were cotton
4.0,"I was so excited to get this dress but I was very disappointed with it. The color and material are good quality but it's a dress that you just wear and sit. Very unpractical. As soon as you lift your hands up or do any movement, the  off shoulder part lifts up and the entire dress lifts up.<br /> Back it goes."
4.0,"Shirt is very soft and flowy. I DID try to order it in YELLOW as it was the most continuous with the tie dyed sleeves.<br />I was surprised to see a WHITE shirt when it arrived.  But i see it is NOT the seller's fault. Amazon is to blame.<br />BUYER BEWARE:When you choose a color, and then select Large , the item color reverts to WHITE."
4.0,These are really cute. I wasn't expecting so much metal though. They are a little bit heavy. B
4.0,"Listen, this stuff if made from loose fabric that clings. It isn't forgiving so if you are self conscious about the little bumps and lumps here and there. It is not for you. It is an amazing dress that offers different styles...I think anyone can wear this dress...no matter what size. You just have to know which style works for your body type and accessorize it with belts, brooches and what ever else you can to make it look like a custom dress made just for you. You will need a bra, or some support because this is just fabric but know you're perfect just the way you are ladies. You are wearing the dress, the dress is not wearing you."
4.0,Really cute but the fabric is more thin/stretchy so it is very &#34;unforgiving&#34; with any bumps you may be self conscious of. I usually am a L/XL and ordered both a XL and XXL just in case. The XL fits well but due to the material I think I will prefer the XXL once it arrives. XL would be perfect with a tummy tucker or leggings.
4.0,"super cute headbands, but the description states for baby. I just had my little one and these do not fit, they are about a half inch too big. They'll work when she's a little older, but was really hoping to use them while she was still little."
4.0,Fabric is very thick on the striated fabric. Like heavy workout piece. Little scratchy on the fabric transitions. A lot of stretch. Have to wear on under shirt for comfort. Well made just too thick for fall.
4.0,"It's cute but since I'm on the shorter side, it didn't really look right for what I was going for."
4.0,The scarf is very nicely made. I was a little shocked at how large and bulky the patch is but it's something I could easily get used to.
4.0,Bought this for my lady as a gift to go with some other stuff. Very pretty chain and she loves it!
4.0,"It is very cute, but a little big. It is also thin so I wouldn‚Äôt count on it to be the only thing you wear when it‚Äôs cold out. But would be super cute layering with a vest!"
4.0,Adorable and comfortable family pjs.
4.0,This is a real nice shirt but a little snug for a 3X. Other than that it‚Äôs really good material.
4.0,"Even though they run a little large, I still like these shorts. They could do away with the fake pockets."
4.0,"The product has pockets which is a plus. However, length wise I find myself pulling down to not flood to my shoes (short lengths). The top is snug on my waist at a 1X, typically wear a size 18 in jeans and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 in height."
4.0,"Nice pattern. I love how it feels. But I think this type of dress looks nicer on taller and slim person. If you‚Äôre not either, this dress will make you look heavier than you really are."
4.0,"It's a little boring, but great for the office."
4.0,"I like that the wool is lined with fleece because 100% wool can be itchy, matched my ivory and taupe hat perfectly!"
4.0,I lost one of my 2g tunnels and no one likes to go to hottopic so I found these! They are a bit sharper than my other ones around the edges and the flare isn‚Äôt as noticeable as my old ones (so the different colors aren‚Äôt THAT noticeable either) but these do the trick! I‚Äôd definitely recommend these! True to size but just be careful with the edges don‚Äôt just ram it into your ear
4.0,I love the screw on back and the sturdiness of the material. They were kind of difficult to unscrew to take them off but other than that they are great.
4.0,"I normally wear an L for dresses and I ordered an M for this , but it fits like an L on me. Not complaining cuz I like this relaxing fit anyway, but am taking one star off because I know this loose fit will most likely throw many people off. The material feels thin and light, great for spring and summer but definitely need more layers in the Fall."
4.0,"Not too skinny and not too thick. It's just right! I saw this at a local department store costing more, but not in my size. Once again,  Amazon to the rescue. Great quality too."
4.0,Looks very nice but extremely heavy and will pull the hole in your ear stop wearing them I was worried my ear with split!
4.0,It is super cute and great quality!! I ordered a 9-12 months and worried about it being small because my baby girl fits in 12 months already. but to my surprise it was too big! but its still so adorable I have decided to take my chances and see if it will fit her in a moth for her birthday!!
4.0,"Dries fast, which is what I needed for traveling. The fit was too small and I needed the next size up."
4.0,"It looks nice but stopped functioning after 4 months. Has not been dropped, hit, soaked, I take it off when I shower. Tried deleting as a key and adding again but car wouldn‚Äôt see it to add. Very unhappy customer as I really liked it while it worked but way too expensive for 4 months use. Update: there is a guarantee and after contacting several customer service representatives the company agreed to replace the ring. Review changed from 1 star to 4 stars"
4.0,Love it. It's fun to wear!
4.0,These are so cute!! The material is really soft and they stay on my daughter's head for the most part. I only gave them 4 stars because the knots stick up really high on her head and the picture shows them laying lower. I've tried to fix them but I keep making them worse I think. Otherwise they're a great purchase!
4.0,Hope it shrinks
4.0,"This is a Christmas gift, not yet given."
4.0,Cute gown However the thread comes loose and dangles off of different parts of the garment. Either the thread is very cheap and breaks apart easily or it‚Äôs not seen very well.
4.0,A little smaller than I thought but nice
4.0,I'm 5'3/156 lbs and ordered a large - I should've gotten a medium. It's a bit large and makes me look like I'm wearing a maternity shirt.
4.0,"Very cute. The fabric is quick dry and perfect for a coverup. The elastic in the waistband rolls a bit which can make the shorts puff out annoyingly, but overall good."
4.0,Such a cute golden retriever Christmas apron for the holidays.
4.0,I love the colors!  Black and white with a little blue/green mixed into it.  Its a lovely matching set.  The hat is topped with a puffy pom pom which is cute as can be.  The scarf is longer than I expected and warm as well.  This look great with a little coat or with a more formal one.  The only minor complain is that the hat fits a little more snugly than I anticipated.
4.0,Beautiful. Fits perfect. I have size H bra and I got the 2X and it fits perfect.  The only thing is that the black is actually a navy color not black as advertised.
4.0,Great looking watch.  Very comfortable and a good size.  I wish the watch band would be longer but it is a good quality and nice looking band.
4.0,"Looking forward to using this bag on my next trip. Roomy enough to hold all of my toiletries in a vertical way. I'm used to packing everything horizontally, so this will be a nice change. As I haven't used it yet, I will edit my review if it doesn't hang well or hold up well to moisture. Looks high quality and feels sturdy, so that's great!"
4.0,"I wasn‚Äôt sure how my husband would like this but he seemed to love it. He uses it for hunting and says it keeps his head fairly warm, and the light on it is pretty bright when it‚Äôs dark out."
4.0,"Love the socks and they fit my almost 3 year olds feet perfectly. Unfortunately, one of the Oona socks was missing and purple is my daughters favorite color. While she is happy to wear the others, she (and I) are quite disappointed that the one pair of purple Oona socks was not complete."
4.0,"Very nice quality, especially for the price. I know, ""everyone says that..."" is it Gucci or Prada quality, no. But I didn't cost me a mortgage payment! Love the color. Great for everyday plus my arms are free to do what I need to!"
4.0,Very warm and pretty good quality. But the rabbit face hits my daughter's shins and not her knees.
4.0,"The dress was cute, but it fit a bit too tight. I am sending it back."
4.0,Such a cute dress and beautiful color. I cannot wait to wear it.
4.0,This shirt looks just like the picture and fit perfectly. True to size!
4.0,great tour t shirt of  reprint
4.0,"I really like these pants. I had been looking for a motor pant that was more or less one color‚Äîhard to find these days. Like everything about these pants except one thing; can‚Äôt wear them lol. Modern moto pants are made to fit leg/knee braces so they‚Äôre kinda baggy in the knee area, well, first ride I scolded them on my banshee exhaust pipe. Don‚Äôt feel like steel woolin‚Äô pant material every ride so going back to shorts/jeans lol<br />When I ordered these in size 30, they came in size 30‚ÄìI had to double check that when I put them on eBay because in my purchase history they say 28..not sure if that‚Äôs a glitch or what."
4.0,"Great quality! All of the tags indicate this is authentic from Germany vs a costume, which is what I was looking for. So cute on! The waist and bust were a bit big, but the apron cinches it. The arm elastic is a little tight. If you have thick arms that could be a challenge but you can easily buy a different shirt. And the dress itself was a bit big in the waist and chest. Im 5‚Äô8, 140lb 36B ordered a 38.  It's really cute. Wore it for Oktoberfest and received lots of compliments."
4.0,"Good, strong belt. Use for wildland fire. Only issue, as someone previously stated, is that the large is a hair too big and medium is a hair too small... Needs an extra-medium. Good belt overall."
4.0,I used it on face masks and they work great!  I only gave it 4 stars because the pack comes in white and black - there is no choice. I only use the white so now I have half a bag of unused black cord locks.
4.0,"This dress is amazing! Right size for my height at 5ft  8.5in,... Hits right at the knee and for a plus size woman (2x),  it stretches nicely and holds in the problem areas well. Getting ready to order it in the black and white stripes now!"
4.0,Super cute and comfortable while providing great arch support. The adjustable straps make it easy to get the perfect fit. Sole molds to your foot after a few wearings so that you have a custom fit.
4.0,The blue has worn away rather quickly but I think the slightly weathered and worn look really suits its. After getting it re sized to my size it fits comfortably all day too.
4.0,"Absolutely adorable and good quality! I had received one with a piece of missing glitter, so I had returned it for a replacement. The replacement looked great on my almost two years old. The only problem is the skirt is short. She does need to wear leggings under it."
4.0,"perfect fit, just too creased; otherwise good deal."
4.0,Love the product. I use it basically everyday. The pockets are a great size to hold what I need. Things are readily accessible. Only small issues... Leaning forward some things can slip out of the pockets and my pruning sheers cut a hole in the bottom of the pocket. I fault my sharp shears more however some gardening items are sharp so maybe pocket fabic could be reinforced a bit better. I would still reccomend this to avid gardeners and plan on buying more as gifts.
4.0,"Vendor used fruit of the loom tee, the printing was very clear, satisfied!"
4.0,"Loved the material, fit, and colors."
4.0,"I was looking for knit gloves that were thin enough to serve as a second layer under fleece gloves.  These fit the bill really well, only a litter thicker than the gloves I lost.  I can use them alone when its not so cold, and they are good under my fleece gloves when it gets around freezing.  (I live in a climate where it rarely gets below 30 degrees as the overnight low.)<br />I am less happy with the colors, they seem a bit bright.  But that is a personal choice.  The six colors I got were white, black, red, purple, yellow, and blue.  The purple and blue are dark, but mid range of those colors.  The blue is close to the color of the LA Dodgers or Kansas City Royals.  I don't know how to describe the purple other than it is not a berry color.<br />As for size, they do stretch.  I have a small hand and they are a tiny bit too big.  Should fit most adults."
4.0,"All in all not to bad of a shirt - has a nice modern look - Fit and finish is what was expected for a mid priced shirt. One improvement would be to make it wrinkle free however- Hope this helps you in your decision-making- Best, Chris"
4.0,"I love the shirt, just wish it was 3"" longer."
4.0,It came as advertised.<br />Could have something to attach to clothing.
4.0,They are nice and comfortable but cannot say there‚Äôs any compression at all. Love the pockets!
4.0,"These leggings are really comfortable and, most importantly, warm! The color is true to the picture (wine color).<br /><br />My only complaint is I'm 5'2"" and these are rather long."
4.0,"I bought this watch when my old watch died and I did not want to spend a lot on a new one because changing batteries is such a nightmare. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I also have problems with wrist bands because I have a small wrist. The band is perfect and the back of the watch is easy to replace the battery. You don't have to hunt to find the site. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the face of the watch is so light it is difficult to read the time. White on silver is not a good combination. But on the other hand at night it stands out and is easily seen to read the time. So I will keep it.<br />I read through a lot of reviews before buying this watch. I liked it so well I bought another. The brand seems to be for women with small wrist, which I find delightful. I will continue to be one of their customers."
4.0,"Good price, but on a taller baby is a little short"
4.0,"The high quality material, beautiful color . Only negative , it doesn't stay in place . Fits tight on the shoulders. Had to adjust the shirt through the night . But overall a nice buy"
4.0,"I mean it's cheap, so it's cheaply made and some of the threading is already coming loose.  But it's beautiful."
4.0,"I wish the packaging it came in was a little better but you cant complain for $13.99... They look exactly like they are shown in the picture, and seem a litte more feminine because the band flairs at the connection slightly then scoops in to get thinner."
4.0,"This is an AMAZING coat. Sadly, it was tailored far too big so I had to return. I am a 41 chest so, I can fit medium or large depending on a few stitches, I ordered a large because I wanted to have room for sweaters or fleece but this came almost as an extra large. Some things about it, first, it is made in India which makes me suspect the origin of the hide used. The hide is what I would call lambskin. It is ultra soft, but not a rugged coat for outdoors. Secondly, the lining is not quilted nor is the jacket insulated to any noticeable degree. Apart from these two VERY minor criticisms, if the coat had been tailored to size, I'd be wearing it right now. It got 4 stars because of size but, it's ORVIS so there is no question of quality. If you want one, order a size (or two) smaller. It really is worth the money if you are looking for a coat that looks rugged and speaks to the style of Teddy Roosevelt."
4.0,Buy this like two sizes up<br />Because it was tight on my baby and I purchased 6 months
4.0,Nice pearls but the photo made the silver leaves look far larger than they were in real life.  A little unsophisticated for a young woman receiving her masters degree!!!
4.0,"I was excited to try this dress out, but wasn't sure which size to order because of the size chart. I ended up ordering my normal size and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'3&#34; and this falls mid knee. The dress feels like someone took a really soft t-shirt and made a dress out of it. It's thin enough that it will hug every curve, but also show every flaw if the right things aren't worn underneath. The stitching isn't the best, and the neckline is unfinished. It looks like it's supposed to fold under, but there isn't a way to keep in in place as you move about your day. I would say that it is comparable to forever21 quality.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
4.0,"I read the reviews multiple times & looked at the pics other women posted & used them as guide for what size to order. I'm 5'4, 170 lbs so I ordered L. The fit was great! The only thing was the length was way  too long. I expected that though from reading the other reviews so I knew I had to hem. After that it was perfect!! I would say this jumper would fit a woman 5'8 in heels perfectly with no alteration needed. I received many compliments & I felt like a true DIVA at the party!!"
4.0,"I recently gained weight due to a disability, and figuring out my size is frustrating. Not to mention I am trying to stay on a practical budget. Currently, I am 5'2"", 155 lbs. Medium was perfect with a bit of room to spare. I prefer loose fit right now. For the price and fit, I am very happy. Didn't shrink and colors are really pretty. Will buy more."
4.0,"Although they look and feel great, they are definitely not polarized. That said, they can't be blu-blockers but still like them never the less."
4.0,"a little on the large side, the bottom bells out a bit.  The fabric is nice and hopefully it will shrink a bit, so I still will wear it."
4.0,"They stay in place and they look pretty. Had them for about two weeks, no issues with tarnishing yet. I take them off when I shower. I like that they came in a pretty box with directions on how to put them on."
4.0,Love the vibrant color. I bought the sky blue. Just too narrow for my feet so not recommended if you work 12 hr shift.
4.0,"I'm between a size 8-12 depending on the brand. This dress fits nice and hides my post partum belly perfectly! Nice stretchy, light and silky material and the pockets are great. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is I'm 5'7&#34; and the dress is extremely too long. It drags under my feet but I'm going to get it hemmed up."
4.0,"Very nice light weight material...fit is good thru the body, just a little tight in the waist..."
4.0,This is a very nice set of rings. I like to combine them and also use them one at a time. Great product for the price.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b8fc24904de69a002622fb6a9c843c6c]] Love these,but I did have to reglue a few pearls though. I suggest you just go over all the rhinestones and pearls with superglue."
4.0,"when i wear this earring and looking at mirrow  is cute and i like it, perfect for summer white  dress."
4.0,"very cute cowgirl hat , lightweight and attractive"
4.0,The sizing was  little off and there's also a weird flap that shows through on the front but otherwise I really like it.  I'm just going to alter it so it fits the way I want it to.
4.0,I think they are very cute. Little big but my daughter is growing fast so it's no problem. I was just sad to see price went down few days after I bought them.
4.0,I love the pants but they are like pajamas not very tight
4.0,Very nicr bag. Music books fit perfectly!
4.0,"These are wonderful pants!  I took one star off because they are NOT wrinkle-free.  But they fit so well and are great for tall girls!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 150lb and I like to wear 3-4‚Äù heels with my dress pants  - I usually wear an 8 tall and the medium/34‚Äù inseam is great.  I used hemming tape to bring them up ever so slightly to have them hit just where I like them on my heels.  So comfy, and you can iron a crease into them to make them look more dressy.  Just ordered a second pair!"
4.0,"Material nice, color is accurate, but the front still does have slight shirt tails.. and that's kind of the whole point of the shirt.. but it still looked okay to wear not tucked in. Better price than the alternative option out there but yeah just not a completely rounded edge on the front"
4.0,Love my ring! True to size. Everyone loves it. Great conversation piece. Makes a great  gift for anyone!
4.0,I have small wrists And these were too big. Returned.
4.0,Or went you want a nice comfy while hanging out at home.
4.0,Well made hat. colors as pictured. Brim easy to adjust to different styles.  Very wrinkled for a &#34;pack able&#34; hat. Will lay very flat. I appreciate the SPF protection.
4.0,"This is a nice scarf. I‚Äôm giving them as gifts, so I don‚Äôt know if they work well or not. I will comment on them more after my daughters use them"
4.0,"the glasses look cute due to its frame and color. Light in weight and the case look nice and cute. It is suitable to wear anywhere and anytime where i live. I like the design overall; easy to store and carry, and is a nice glasses to have this Summer."
4.0,"The material is similar to a t-shirt. I usually wear an XL in shirts, so that is what I ordered. But this is way way too big! I probably would have fit into a medium. I should have sent it back and got a medium, but I didn't.<br />It looks similar to a lightweight bathrobe. So I will probably wear it around the house."
4.0,Makes kind of a weird sound when you first get it. Almost like a crinkly paper?
4.0,The black and purplish one were SUPER cute...the white/Goldish one...not so much. In fact I threw them out because it was obvious how cheap they were. I think since the other 2 are darker colors they don‚Äôt look as cheap. And I liked they‚Äôre size. They weren‚Äôt too big.
4.0,"Fits nice, easy to take on and off,  pretty, feminine bracelet"
4.0,Exactly what I needed and as described.
4.0,"Good Sweater, but I needed a size bigger.  If you are close to the next size, go ahead and get the bigger size."
4.0,I love how they feel on me don't even know you are wearing them
4.0,"Hey ran quite a bit small but my daughter loved them so we let her keep them. For the price they were a great buy. Though They don't seem to be the most well built shoe, they will easily last long enough for her to wear them for the summer."
4.0,"Tried other ones on Amazon and they were awful. This is the closest to the grinch at a good price. Eyebrows on mask could look better, you can see the mesh more than the hair. But other than that it‚Äôs amazing!"
4.0,"Nice fabric, very comfy and classy at the same time.  Good quality price ratio!"
4.0,absolutely gorgeous. It took over a month to arrive but was worth the wait.
4.0,Too was a little wide in shoulders and much longer than needed.
4.0,A little smaller than expected.  maybe they will stretch out a bit.  First day I put them on was -10 F and my feet didn't get as cold as the rest of me and they stayed dry.  I'm happy with these boots.
4.0,I bought this for my Mom as a gift and she loves it
4.0,"The dress is very pretty with a heavy material. You can tell the detail is cheaply made and applied (completely fitting because of the price and I‚Äôm totally ok with it... not sure why people complain about it when you‚Äôre buying a dress on amazon for like 100 bucks) but you can‚Äôt tell unless you look up close. Even still, it‚Äôs very pretty and not something people notice. It laces up in the back which is a pain to do but comes out nice and leaves room for and fluctuations in your size leading up to event/ night of eating/ drinking/ bloat. I got a ton of compliments on it and over all am happy with the purchase."
4.0,I purchased this item for the sun protection while gardening.  I like the hat very much even though a side snap on the top of the cap was broken.  I didn't plan on to use the snap.  The back part does cover my neck very well.  Sadly the sleep protectors aren't meant for some one with large biceps.  The gloves are large but work well.
4.0,"I give it four stars because the barbell looks a little smaller than the picture, other than that everything else is good."
4.0,Nice! The Cross is heavy and pretty the only flaw is the connector from the chain to the Cross it's lightweight and I don't know if it can hold the Cross
4.0,"My first impression was‚Ä¶ ‚Äúno way‚Äù, but I kind of like them. First, the material is very soft and seems to be a good quality denim. I‚Äôm so use to skinny jeans and these are very loose. However, I realize that‚Äôs the way they are suppose to fit. I think they would look best with a form fitting top and perhaps heels. I would have liked them to be longer. Bottom line, I‚Äôll probably keep them. I need to step outside my box and get with the changing styles. :). I ordered a small, FYI."
4.0,"it is a beautiful necklace, and by luck it survived the journey.<br />the outside box was crushed and the inside box was crushed.<br />so glad that the necklace wasn't broken and it's a good thing it wasn't meant to be a gift.<br />otherwise I would be demanding my money back!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a little on the larger side.  The v is in the front and back of the shirt
4.0,"I like the shirts and they are a good value.  If you are looking for warmth this is not the product you should buy.  Also, buy a size larger than you think you need they run on the small side."
4.0,I got the xl and I think if I got 2xl it would fit like the model. Good quality and material. Great shirt!!
4.0,"Nice fit. The material is thin, but will feel good on warm days.  The colors are spot on from the picture."
4.0,I got so may compliments on these glasses.
4.0,"I bought these shoes for my little girl. They are not really built for running, but work just fine for every day activities."
4.0,Wincolor-Looks just as pic runs small I got the xtra large us large and it's still a bit tight but otherwise love the quality
4.0,Boxers
4.0,"I love the watch....easy to set up and even easier to operate.  Love the fact with a touch of the button I can instantly have my heart rate any time of day, working out or resting.  I would recommend this watch to anyone."
4.0,Love these!  They are a bit loose on me (I'm a size 2-4) but very comfortable and a great pattern!
4.0,"I was surprised that the earrings were not as pictured, they appear to be the same size/length but some are very large. Oh well. They are cute, trendy and inexpensive. Very light weight and most are comfortable to wear. The pink wire pair not so much."
4.0,my daughter like it and fit perfectly
4.0,Really good glasses for the money.
4.0,"This is lovely, but broke in six months."
4.0,"Would have been five stars except for the very strong artificial fruit smell. Smelled like Strawberry Shortcake doll, which isn‚Äôt a plus for us. Otherwise, good quality and wears well."
4.0,Excellent large lunchbox.
4.0,"The Jersey was lovely and arrived on time. The white label that was stuck to the jersey was a bit hard to peel off. Finally came off with a little residue left. Otherwise, jersey was perfect"
4.0,Daughter loves this dress -it looks very nice.<br />just be mindful of size-<br />She is 5'5 106 lbs and I ordered a large.<br />Material does wrinkle easily.
4.0,"Love this pretty top! I will say that it didn't look exactly the same as the pic tho! and there is a seam at the waist that this image doesn't display very well. Over all I love it! It's long and pretty! It goes well with a tan waist belt, jenes, and boots. It's perfect for a romantic date, or any nice occasion. Also this is true to size. I'm a 40DD and ordered an XL and it fits great!! I def recomened this as top or a cute short dress."
4.0,Very pretty ring. I ordered the size 8 and it fit perfectly.
4.0,Exchanging for the next size up but my little one loved these and seemed to be comfortable. Going for the bigger size so we can use them all summer
4.0,"He loved them. Normally wears a 4 bought them in a 4.5 but they were tight, had to get a 5"
4.0,"These little guys have adorned my girlfriends ears on a number of occasions. they are kitschy, bright, and fun. They feel a bit too light though, so the durability is a concern, as is the graphic and its longevity. But overall it is fun and comfy."
4.0,A little big. But for sleep clothes. It really doesn‚Äôt matter
4.0,I really like these so far. The adjustable strap is nice and the fabric has held up. They‚Äôre not super soft but they work and fit good!
4.0,"I bought this as part of a Mardi Gras costume. The entire dress really is see-through. I may or may not use it since I‚Äôll need a full slip or another tight-fitting dress to go underneath it.<br /><br />The material is extremely thin. It also sheds sequins, though not as badly as a lot of clothing. It‚Äôs also just a bit itchy/uncomfortable, though not enough not to buy it.<br /><br />It fit as expected."
4.0,"Super comfortable, long enough to wear with leggings. Material is thin so it will be a nice spring top, but it also means it will show &#34;imperfections,&#34; if you know what I mean. It's just what I was looking for."
4.0,"Super cute, surprisingly comfortable, but size up. I‚Äôm a 36C & about a size 8 in jeans. I got some junk in the trunk and slightly broad shoulders. I ordered the large which fit nicely, but the tank top was slightly tight in the back (at the top by the straps) and the shorts ride up a tiny bit cause of my butt. But I am happy with these, I‚Äôll probably order another pair in the XL. I do think if you are full figured these wouldn‚Äôt work for you, I‚Äôm normally a M, sometimes L, never a XL.<br /><br />Oh, and my boyfriend loved this set to! :)"
4.0,Good product no laces to trip over and are white so they go with anything they wear.
4.0,My niece looks great on it. Super cute
4.0,love how soft and comfortable it is but it is 2 sizes to big
4.0,I am petite and short and I ordered a size small..it's somewhat small but wearable for me...medium would have been the best size.
4.0,Chain tarnished
4.0,"Super cute and we'll made, just too tight around the bottom even after ordering a size larger than I would normally order"
4.0,"I like the material. It is quality made. However, I have a long torso and it was way too short. I‚Äôm quite bummed as I was hoping it would be longer."
4.0,it came even bigger than i expected but with few removing o the links to make it smaller looks awesome honestly
4.0,"I love the idea of this, but I wish the material was softer. I'm hoping it'll be less stiff after a wash."
4.0,These work very well with my progressives.  Lenses are slightly larger than my glasses but that's not a problem.  They have a slight tint (sepia or very light brown) which I would have preferred clear but this is what was available.  They are well made and work fine.  I actually purchased 2 different pairs to get the best choice of strength.
4.0,"I love the look and the size is spot on. Unfortunately, these boots are really uncomfortable. I can only wear them for short periods at a time. Also, be sure to scuff up the wooden soles because they are very slippery!"
4.0,The slots are tight and difficult to remove cards because they get caught under zipper part. I do like the size and that it holds my pixel phone without issue.
4.0,100% Best bracelet I ever brought.
4.0,I like that you can wear them together or separately.  Have received a lot of compliments on them.  I would recommend
4.0,"Good,warm,nicely designed bonnet."
4.0,"I really like this skirt. My preference for tennis skirts is the pleated, preppy look - this is more of a dry-fit, actual exercise and ‚Äòsweat hard‚Äô type of tennis skirt. I like that there are shorts layered underneath. I like that the skirt sucked me in a bit. I did not like how it flattened my butt and showed everything underneath from my tucked in shirt to the built in pockets of the skirt. The fabric is not forgiving even though it feels amazing. It‚Äôs a cute look. Maybe a pattern would‚Äôve been better than solid black. I definitely recommend this item and would buy it again. I got compliments!"
4.0,so the hat and sunglasses their job but my kid doesn‚Äôt want to wear neither of them
4.0,"This was better quality than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised (I got the maroon one with the fringes hanging down). It is the perfect size and seems to be made very well, no issues so far and I've worn it quite a few times. I have not washed it yet though so I cannot speak to that. Just wish it were a little cheaper, but the price is good compared to what you'd find in stores for the same quality."
4.0,"I love these glasses.  They are super cute, and sturdy. For the price they seem well made. I would buy again.  It comes with a case."
4.0,These earrings are really cute and the black felt storage bag was a nice touch but these earrings are SUPER tiny! I haven't worn them yet as I think they would be better suited for little girls.
4.0,"They are lovely and sparkly and nicely made<br /> However the studs will bend and the backs do not fit, they are too small. I have spare backs I purchased to replace lost ones and they work ok."
4.0,Great hat. It fits great and keeps my head warm
4.0,It's some what bigger at the shoulders. Needs an undershirt to go with it.
4.0,Beautiful dress! Great fit! Nice thick material and the colors are bright.
4.0,"it was rather large in the sleeves, but the rest fit fine. really cuts shirt"
4.0,"It is as pretty as the picture; it is well made, and my granddaughter really liked it. She said I'm awesome."
4.0,Super thin material isn‚Äôt like a spandex fit. Exactly what I needed!
4.0,Great casual sweater!
4.0,I originally bought a small and had to buy a medium. The cups are still a little small but if I go any bigger then the straps will be too long.
4.0,Beautiful dress for the price.  Love it!
4.0,YOU MAY WANT TO ORDER A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY DO. THE FIT IS SHORTER LENGTH WITH NORMAL WIDTH. VERY WARM FABRIC AND THE PRINT IS AS SHOWN ON DISPLAY.
4.0,I absolutely love this shirt and so does my best friend.  It is perfect for this California heat.  My only complaint is that the sleeve buckles are coming undone.
4.0,"The colors  are not like the picture. The green is brighter, and looks cheap. Haven't worn it yet.i have received a lot from this seller and this is the first time I was disappointed."
4.0,Nice fit better than expected material not thin a little thicker than most shirts.
4.0,More like a sports bra than a crop top
4.0,"5'6 150lbs, bought a Medium. Fit perfect in bust, too big in waist and a little too big in hips, but really easy to take in. Seams on each side and straight down the back, so super simple to take in as needed. Buying another one in another print. My SO LOVES this dress on me."
4.0,"This dress fits rather loose on me. I'm 5'6"" - 125lb athletic build. I ordered the small. There's a generous amount of material and it's rather thick and heavy. Haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not. Even though it's excellent quality material (NOT, NOT sheer or flowy) I think it may be a bit warm for our tropical vacation?"
4.0,"They are cute belts. I am currently a size 18, and the belts barely fit. Not for plus sized people."
4.0,The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about is that they hit my face often. I really love that they match everything! So cute! I split them with my best friend and now we match!!
4.0,"Bag has a funny smell, but my sister loves the bag"
4.0,This bracelet is a little tight on my wrist. I have others like this one and they fit fine. I'm looking at ways to restring it so it's not tight.
4.0,i gave it too my daughter it fit her better
4.0,These are great material shirts but fit very small. I would suggest going up at least 1 size if you want it to fit tighter and 2 sizes if you want a bit more baggy look.
4.0,"I bought these for my wife, and they lasted a little more than a year with daily use.  All in all, not bad for a slipper.  She loved them so much I bought her another pair a year later, and she loved those too.  She says they're very comfortable, but as with any slippers, they'll get thin and not so cushony after a while."
4.0,"If you're looking for a slimming dress design, this isn't it but it's very soft, comfy and casual. The length is perfect for me and I'm 5'6"". Love that it has pockets!"
4.0,"The quality on this bra is great. Color is great. My only complaint is that the cups are a little small for it being the same size as other bras I wear, but they usually stretch out some."
4.0,"i bought 2 of these, for just shy of $10 each, when you factor in the shipping costs (each item has it's own shipping cost). the items came fairly quickly, wi 2 weeks. i was drawn to the good reviews of this item, and i agree with the substance of most of the reviews- the scarves are lovely, soft and beautiful. the only thing i would say tho, is that they were filthy dirty out of the packaging- you could feel the grime, like a dirty dog feels, and i hand washed them immediately, with dark brown chemical-smelling yuck coming out. i washed and rinsed quite a few times, and dried by laying flat.  The items are now really nice. i'm giving 4 stars cuz of the poor condition when you receive."
4.0,"very cute i wished it looked a little more sophisticated though, the chain wasnt as pretty as i thought but it was pretty"
4.0,"Likes ... quality, cheaply priced and antifog"
4.0,"Was hoping for more bright colors in mine. But it's beautiful!! Nice loose fit, open poncho type sides, the bottom hits me mid thigh."
4.0,"Wasn't sure what to expect, was pleasantly surprised.  Feel got great value."
4.0,"Loved the product, accept the fit. My husband usually wears Large. We buy XL in sweatshirts because he likes them roomy. I originally bought an XL, when he put it on it was so small. I sent it back for a refund and ordered XXL. That one fits nice."
4.0,Onsie fit well.  The hat was way too big.  Will be a long while before she can fit into it.  My husband loves our daughter in this.  Thinks its so funny.
4.0,Great quality and fit. I love it!
4.0,"I purchased this several years ago but recently attached it to my Triumph T100 Bonneville sidecover using a couple straps (behind the sidecover through the side MOLLE straps), and through the top &#34;tongue&#34;, where I cut off the big buckle, and wrapped the strap buckle around the frame rail Doesn't get in the way of my leg when sitting on it either."
4.0,pretty can dress up or down
4.0,This shirt had great quality! It felt just like a Bella tee. Wish it came in white!
4.0,A little short and narrow for my feet
4.0,"I have been having so much trouble with the sizing of the pj's.  I order a Large and they come looking like a small for a child.  HOWEVER, this set came and it was on the small side of Large.  So if you want a more less snugger  fit, go one size up.  Very Cute."
4.0,I am slim with no hips. This fit like a glove. Tan is see thru so be strategic with the undies. The ankle is to die for. Go one size up if you have thighs and hips.
4.0,"I had to loosen the straps all the way to get this on, but it's very cute once you go through the trouble. A side zipper would be nice. Very cute colors though, and the fit is flattering."
4.0,"I give these shorts an overall 3.5 stars. They fit a little smaller then ‚Äútrue‚Äùsize.  I‚Äôm usually a large/xl but these were a bit tight putting them<br />In. They did stretch once in and were nice and comfy. They have a weird crotch area. When u put them on, the crotch area hangs low so u have to pull them up ‚Äúpantyhose‚Äù style, one leg at a time and then they kinda bunch up. Material is thick but still soft.  I do love the length to right above the knees and I like the deep pocket on the legs (perfect for cellphone placement)."
4.0,"Fits nicely, has good tunny control, and it's nice and high-waisted, however, the top rolls down when you sit."
4.0,"Good size, lots of outside pockets. Just wish it was priced a little lower. This isn't a 'quality made' item per se and the price could have been cut in half."
4.0,It will be used for a handbag as a Christmas present
4.0,I‚Äôm glad I ordered this! The blazer looks great and fit perfectly. The material is lightweight and fit true to size on me. Will definitely order more.
4.0,"The material stretches on this and distorts a little bit (I'm a c cup and the material was too tight around the bust line). It is definitely still wearable, but I could have used one size larger and been more comfortable"
4.0,This set is so elegant and beautiful . I got lots of compliments
4.0,"Sturdy, comfortable and fashionable."
4.0,Its great. I picked this one over the other cos it can hold more cards and it does. Its actually not that difficult to take out and put back the cards into the holder. I am happy with it.
4.0,"I am pleased with these as a comfortable alternative to face masks. The fabric is thin and breathable (yes, I realize this defeats the purpose, but our family is wearing masks due to force, not fear). The orange that came in my daughter's set was a Hunter's blaze orange, so we have it to the dog to wear for hunting season. The blue in my son's set is a blue & purple mix, so we have it to our daughter. Other than the color discrepancies, we are I have no complaints. Will probably order more."
4.0,"trying to figure out sizing. i'm 6'4, 185lbs. so i'm tall but on the slighter side of things. i bought i size 3xl. the sleeve length and body length is perfect, but the chest is too big. not WAY too big, but too big. i emailed to see if i should go to a 2xl. i just don't want to sacrifice length. i normally wear a large tall, so i'm used to having to buy stuff that's a little roomy in the chest/gut area. the 3xl is like a larger size XL. so if you are taller, i'm assuming you'd want to order up to get the length you'll need.<br /><br />quality seems good. padding/armor looks sufficient for a slower speed tumble. back armor is lacking but should help."
4.0,"These are great for the price, very comfortable and best of all NOT sheer and completely squat proof! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and these come to my ankles so I‚Äôm not sure they would be good for someone taller. I ordered a size small and they have ok stretch but I would not size down on these. I will order again!!"
4.0,"My son doesn‚Äôt like to wear shoes often,  but he will wear these. Sometimes I think it‚Äôs tight on the back of his ankle just because it has to be so they stay on.. anythinf digs in a tiny bit after a while. But they were cute and worked I like them"
4.0,Super cute and protective
4.0,"it is fine, I just would have preferred if it opens in front instead of the back."
4.0,Was some what satisfied it what of been nice if there was actually a variety of the different sizes it said it had mine came with a jumbo slice of bread and 19 others were all minis?
4.0,Cute but super hard to clasp shut
4.0,Item as pictured. Looks cute. Feels soft
4.0,"Fits well I wear it a lot, I actually bought it for a dress in the fall I needed a strapless<br />But I never wore it that way it is now an everyday bra"
4.0,"Ran a little large in my opinion, but awesome shirt!"
4.0,They are polarized and I can see without buying prescription sunglasses. It's all good.
4.0,Look great and cheap one. My wife is very happy regarding voeons women's watch. Thanks for seller who given this watch.
4.0,"Really good for flat items, but anything that has width makes it a little tight....other wise wonderful"
4.0,Muy bueno pudiera traer una argolla
4.0,I love these wedges! They're chunky lightweight and super comfortable. I wish they had other colors like beige and brown because I would definitely buy them::)))
4.0,"adorable and well made dress, but too small for my girl 4t/5T. tight across the chest."
4.0,Cute top.  Form fitting around the bust but not too tight in the arms.
4.0,Cute but runs very small. Will save for a gift.
4.0,Like the style! Thought it would be a little looser.
4.0,"I usually wear a size 6, and ordered medium. I am very happy with it. My only complaint is the beaded portion started coming away at the seam after only one day of wear. I will have to hand stitch the seams back together."
4.0,"The printing is nice. The jacket was smaller than I expected. I usually order one size up, so it works. The hood is huge and I like that."
4.0,Very cute!  Good quality and received promptly. We have a new tradition of brother and sister wearing matching Christmas pyjamas for Christmas Eve!
4.0,Great sweater. Very comfy and warm. Pockets are big which I love. Only issue I have with it is the fit on the shoulders. It falls off my shoulders quite often.
4.0,Beautiful with a unique shape not too<br /> big!
4.0,I really wanted this to work for me. I have a wedding in Key West and the frond design was so cute. I am 5'11 and have a pretty long torso. It was too tight in the pelvic region and did not work for me. The price is good enough I am going to give it to a friend with a different build then me. If you have a shorter torso this would be a great buy.
4.0,Cute leotard. Size up. The arms are short.
4.0,"Good necklace, but the J likes to flip upside down a lot. Really good necklace for the price though."
4.0,Not very high end but good for one-time use.
4.0,"The top is tight for large, but the bottoms fit perfectly. Not too long, not too short. Cute pattern in the fabric. Substantial quality."
4.0,"Cute, material is thinner then I expected"
4.0,"These made-in-China compression socks are very colorful (a bit too crazy for this household).  The socks provide moderate compression but two minor issues - the length is almost above the knee for a 5'11"", shoe size 11  person (the L/XL) version  and the heel compression is barely noticeable.  But the socks are easy to put on and take off, does relieve swelling and overall very comfortable.  Most designs seem more suitable for a slightly yonger crowd, but the quality of these socks are good."
4.0,"My workplace actually uses this brand in some of their shirts, but they tend to sell them way too expensive just for adding a logo. So I searched around for them on here as plain polos. They are a good quality, the fabric is smooth and moisture wicking and I work outside with no hint of sweat on the shirts. They do tend to shrink, and are a form fitting shirt. I am larger chested, so I order them 1-2 sizes larger to accommodate. I normally wear a large but will get these in XL. Since they shrink, the large tends to get too short for me to wear comfortably. But I would say the shirts themselves are natural to size. I have gotten 4 different colors of these shirts now and it has been pretty consistent sizing."
4.0,I read reviews before picking a size.  Reviews said this tank runs small.  I normally wear a medium so ordered a large and it fits perfectly.  The fabric is very light and have not washed yet so don't know how it will hold up yet.  Love the color and style.
4.0,"This is an elegant, beautiful watch.  The thin straps is a nice touch.  Did not receive a 5 star due to the clasp not as easy to adjust.  I can see it giving out soon. However for the price you can not go wrong."
4.0,Case has a pleasing appearance with soft leather outside a felt like lining. Closure clamp is not a squeeze to open. I must use a finger to pry open the squeeze to keep open. Likewise the clamp does keep it case closed tightly so nothing will fall out. Didn‚Äôt rate on durability as I just received them. Time will tell. Nice case for the money.
4.0,"While the Low Crown is a big improvement, the adjustable sizing when fit right still makes the cap ride a bit higher than I like, thus the reason for only 4 stars..  Still, I like the cap a lot.  I bought another with NO Crown and so far I think I like it better.  They are both the RAPDOM series and both great hats that I'm happy to recommend.  Velcro for placing patches etc. is placed just right for patches on front, both sides, back and top."
4.0,"Nice colors and quality but they run on the small size.  My husband wears men's 10.5 size shoes, and these were a bit too small on him.  He gave them to me, and I wear women's size 9 shoes.  They fit me just fine."
4.0,Got for my niece who is four years old. She is small for her age so she‚Äôs usually between a 3T-4T in clothes. I can tell you she was mostly obsessed with the unicorn horn and wears it even to eat her cereal in the morning. It‚Äôs a really cute addition and both products are well made. Vivid colors.
4.0,Beautiful....no zipper...
4.0,"It's just like the photo, but doesn't look good on me."
4.0,"This is a very nice wrap. The Velcro is incredible!! Little kids (or even frisky husbands) have a hard time tugging them open. Be careful when washing, though. The Velcro will stick to towels and can ruin them. Make sure you secure the Velcro to itself before washing. The length is very nice too. The crisscross straps do keep the back part of the elastic from stretching. So, that‚Äôs a downside of you need the elastic to stretch around your body. The color is very beautiful. One of my favs. Overall, a great product."
4.0,Love the looks but not the fit.  They went back.  I‚Äôm a standard size 8 but these were too short even with light weight socks.  Very cute.  Looked like decent construction.  But unfortunately I won‚Äôt be the fashionista on the hiking trails with these
4.0,I like this bag but it is only meant for one racket at a time.
4.0,The clasp is a hook not a loop through
4.0,Very cute. Decent quality. Lasts about 11 seconds. My daughter wears it around her neck and whenever she asks me for something she jokingly flips it over darting her eyes from it to me.
4.0,"I‚Äôm a big girl and I‚Äôve had a tumor removed from my abdomen so I can‚Äôt where pants with firms waist bands or buttons because it hurts my scar. These pants fit perfectly, they are so soft, and they look nice enough to wear in my business casual office. I ordered the size I always do with no problems. The loss of one star is because I don‚Äôt know how long these are going to hold up. The fabric in the crotch is thin and I won‚Äôt be surprised if I have to mend the area after several washes."
4.0,Great deal on sunglasses. One pair came with a part of the metal piece broken but I was able to repair them with super glue and a little cracks in a part of the tinting but unable to see them when wearing them.
4.0,This case has worked well on my tactical bag. It goes with the same style and sleek design.  It did make my bag a little bulky while it was velcroed on so I am using the clip more to use so it hangs.<br /><br />It has protected my glasses well.
4.0,Great fit. Good quality for the price.
4.0,This is a lovely watch. So affordable! I will have to have the band adjusted. It's far too big for my wrist.
4.0,"I love this.the stone is deeply colored, not fake or dyed. The charm it's self is really well made and big enough to draw attention when wearing it. The only drawback is the chain that came with it. It's very thin, cheaply made and feel like it will snap at any moment."
4.0,"I liked it while i had it. Another must have admired it, as it was stolen within a few days of delivery.<br />Service was excellent. Product was well made. The eye is as seen in picture, except with more depth of perception from the converse lense. Very pretty."
4.0,"I think the print is beautiful, but the colors aren't as intense as the pictures. I ordered one size up, but it fit me a little bit larger, so I suggest buying your usual size.<br /><br />It is a pretty swimsuit, I will adjust it and use it."
4.0,A little too tight for my liking for work.
4.0,"The cut of this top is very strange at the bottom. It is very slim, much less so than the image suggests. I'd assume it's because she doesn't have as wide a Middle as I have, so that would make sense. I'll say that it definitely runs small. I typically wear a small or medium at places like Target or Old Navy. I'd compare the sizing of the large to that of a small unisex tshirt. The generic tshirts that typically are screened with logos at a tshirt printing shop.<br />It's also probably going to be more flattering on someone who is a bit taller than my 5'3&#34;. It's pretty long.<br /><br />Aside from that, the material feels really nice. I haven't washed it yet, but it seems like it would hold up well.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it, but for that price it is a good buy."
4.0,"Love it! Light as a feather! Perfect for chilly mornings here in the desert. Glad I ordered a large, runs a tad small. I'm 5'3"" and it's just right. Pockets to carry puppy treats etc..  very happy with this item."
4.0,Very pretty. Just the right size and style for what I needed them for. I‚Äôm doing pamper baskets and will be putting slippers in them but they needed a little flair.
4.0,Perfect fit. Casual and Comfy.
4.0,Good quality but little bit tide
4.0,It's cute and handy
4.0,"Im 5' and 115 lbs. I ordered a small.<br />Love love love this dress. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little big in the waist and hips, and is more a teal than turquoise as it saysüò¢ I ordered this for my sons wedding and there was no option for an xs üòü  It is absolutely perfect for a mother of the groom dress. Im going to keep as a backup dress for wedding and will definetly will be wearing at Christmas parties‚ò∫"
4.0,"Keeps my glasses from fogging and definitely keeps outside air from getting in around edges.<br /><br />However, very snug fitting that is uncomfortable to wear for long periods."
4.0,"The color is a bit off and doesn't quite match my watch, but you have to look really close.  If you do, you are either a close friend and don't care, or you are not, in which case I don't care.  It looks really nice and it's a nice change from the silicone and nylon bands."
4.0,"Based off men's sizes, and still a very comfy t-shirt"
4.0,WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE
4.0,Really cute outfit have to find a thong or Bikini Bottom to wear up under and it runs big I usually wear a medium had to return it and get a small
4.0,Super cute And we'll made. My only problem is that the hair bow wasnt pre tied so you have to do it your self and I couldn't figure it out but that is a good thing cuz you can make it bigger as your baby grows. And the biggest problem for me in I got the smallest size for my 6 month old cuz she's a small baby and it was still way to big like she could ware it when she is way older. But other then having to wait super cute! I would definitely buy again in a different color.
4.0,"Nice size , weight & capacity. the middle of the graphic looks smudged  Seems like a dark blue shade shouldn‚Äôt be there. Since I bought it partly because I liked the graphics, I am disappointed."
4.0,"It's simple really, quality plus price equals a happy customer. Very glad I chose this product"
4.0,It was the gold one that I received first...be careful; not to bring an other gold glasses again I ordered a gold and a silver
4.0,The rose colored one runs super big. A size M fit more like an XXL. The green seemed to run more TTS.
4.0,The band is nice and soft feels good on the wrist and looks good with the watch I put it on. Only complaint is that the buckle is huge
4.0,Nice dress bur runs small
4.0,Little bigger than expected which makes the weight of the flip flop a lil awkward. Shldv ordered my actual size but other reviews Said they ran small. They're cute tho.
4.0,"Very nice classic looking watch, has some weight to it. Will be buying the others! Thanks."
4.0,This were very big. Cute product but very large for a child
4.0,I really like how breatheable this show is. I bought a size bigger since his current shoes were getting tight but those were way too big. Bought the size he currently wears and still are too big but not by much. They slip off his foot and it seems that of the back of the shoe was higher they wouldn‚Äôt pop off so easily. I bought tieless laces for them and no matter how tight I fasten them it doesn‚Äôt keep the shoe on. A thicker sock does the trick but defeats the purpose of having them breatheable. Still love them though; maybe they‚Äôll fit better when he grows a little more.
4.0,This is a great piece and I only gave it 4 out of 5 because it's thinner than I expected.
4.0,I really like the size and the weight. Plenty of zipper pockets. I really don‚Äôt like the black and white American flag easy to remove Velcro.
4.0,"I really loved the swimsuit and the print, unfortunately as I am a larger chested women (38dd) I had to return the suit because I could not get the top to fit and hold the girls in the way I wanted. I have purchased other suits with different tops styles from this company before and will be looking to buy a different style to replace this one."
4.0,The shoes run very small but you get exactly what you see. Very cute socks and shoes.
4.0,"These are really nice quality, pretty sandals. They are as pictured with the green/black stone in the middle. I do have a wider foot- these still fit but are slightly snug. Really like these and definitely recommend."
4.0,Comfortable but way too big...oh well. Every designer fits everyone differently- I‚Äôm satisfied with the sweats but doubtful I‚Äôll wear them in public.
4.0,I needed something like these to wear with some of my lower cut T shirts and sundresses where a bra would look tacky.  My husband said these look better than the nonpadded &#34;branks&#34;  (tank style bra) I used to wear because I no longer &#34;look like a hippie!&#34;  These are comfy and I took a tip from someone else's posting and stitched the pads in place so the won't fall out in wash.  I took one star off bc the fabric is not as soft as some others I've tried but I don't notice it any longer.
4.0,"Great quality exotic skin, the buckle is spring loaded ""magic buckle"", my first experience with this type of mechanism so I can't speak to it's durability..,we'll see!"
4.0,"As others have mentioned it‚Äôs not the most secure given the adjustable strap, but I have a tip to help a little. After getting it adjusted to your suitcase loosen it just a little and then tie a knot right next to the adjusting mechanism on the side the mechanism must slide for it to loosen. Now the only way to loosen it is to unlock it.<br /><br />It has held up well so far to international travel and probably the best thing about it is how much easier it is to recognize my black suite case amongst all the other black suite cases."
4.0,"Kids loved them, they all seemed to work (at least at the time). We bagged them in sets of 4 and gave out as carnival prizes. The rubberbands were a little flimsy."
4.0,"Mine did come as shown, the bow (possibly belt) is missing. The dress is comfort and fits well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 145lbs, 36DD. It come below my knees, but I don‚Äôt mind. It feels good. I‚Äôm super disappointed it didn‚Äôt have the bow."
4.0,"love it, fits well"
4.0,"Buttons too low, must be moved to be able to place the mask loops on them"
4.0,"It's a very pretty stone, but I was expecting the loop part to be centered over the top of the stone, but it isn't, it is slightly off and ruins the aesthetics‚Äã. Otherwise, it is a pretty necklace with vibrant energy."
4.0,"Rough, and good color"
4.0,A bit thinner then i expected. But nice fit and i get tons of compliments on it.
4.0,Little big in size.
4.0,"The shipping was fast! I got it three days after ordering! The material feels nice and smooth, and doesn‚Äôt dig into my skin. Very colorful print. My only worry is the clip doesn‚Äôt feel sturdy. Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,I'm really large up top so I ordered a little bigger but definitely didn't need to... theres plenty of room.
4.0,Love this dress but it fits funny around the shoulders and arms!
4.0,Not comfortable. Higher quality gloves that aren‚Äôt these fit better. But for the price it‚Äôs good.
4.0,The teapot charms are very cute.  Please note that they are small charms.  Be sure to check your shipping charges and the price of the charms.
4.0,"These pajamas are very comfortable. They fit very well. What I don‚Äôt like about them is the material inside the avocado cracks. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think they will last long. In the past, material like this will peel. No I would not purchase them again for this reason. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth the money."
4.0,Chemical smell last a while but eventually goes away
4.0,I absolutely LOVE Red Pandas. I only have this 4 stars because it was lacking in red color. It was more brown than red. But could tell that it wasn't a raccoon!
4.0,Strong and durable. Came in an assortment of colors!!
4.0,"It keeps my hat looking good.  The only drawback it has is in removing pet hair.  It works on the pet hair, but a fair amount of effort has to be put into it. (My hair is not a problem as I have none.)"
4.0,"These could be a little better quality for the money. Mine came with a missing paw pad, but overall still pleased with something I wore for halloween."
4.0,I have tried several different types & brands previously but none of them gripped my spectacle frames like these ones! I love walking in the morning and used to worry about losing my eyeglasses during a walk. That worry is gone now.
4.0,"They fit a little snug they are not for people with wide feet and ankles.. they still fit, the color is popping! I love my first pair of Rain boots!"
4.0,Very pretty and light weight. perfect for my use.  I would prefer it not have the big eagle on the back though
4.0,like the robe but need to return as it is too small
4.0,"I carry around a lot in my wallet and was looking for something that could handle the capacity, maybe even leave a little extra. Things were a little tight in the end I and I did need to lose a card, but capacity is more than most. Of equal importance, it seems to be very well constructed (and looks great too)."
4.0,I like the design of these mittens.I also like I could buy size small..
4.0,Clean looking just could have been in a nicer box
4.0,Need to order one size bigger
4.0,Very cute for earrings or necklace.
4.0,"The pattern on this dress looks better in person than the photo. It is simple and fits my wife well, and has no visible issues with the way it's put together. Simple and comfortable, a very good deal for what it is."
4.0,"It fit perfectly. I was slightly disappointed in the qtuality of the fabric, but considering the price, I think it's a great purchase."
4.0,Thought it was gonna be bigger...but still a very nice bag.
4.0,Came just as described. I just wish they were a little sturdier. The color is beautiful and the design is lovely too.
4.0,I would like to mention if you have a butt this definitely could feel like you're wearing a huge diaper just because of the ruffles at the bottom. But this is super comfortable I wear the shirt a ton even during the day with leggings or jeans.
4.0,"With its little unicorn design and rainbow colors, the shoe is fun and catchy. It seems to be durable and it got good traction in water. It is comfortable to wear and dries quickly. This shoe has a standard water shoe design and with adjustable straps.<br />Despite being breathable and comfortable to wear for a long time, my toddler wears it everywhere. The product is as described in the product description. Buying is a good idea."
4.0,"These are nice socks and seem to be good quality.  They have a nice rubbery strip on the heel to keep them in place which is a good addition.  I did however have a hole on the arch of one sock where the 3 colors met.  Could just be one of those rare occurrences, but I will update my review if I find the stitching/quality is sub-par."
4.0,I bought it for my granddaughter's birthday.  It was a little big but it was fine because she gets really cold after swimming.  The terrycloth  on the inside made it extra warm.
4.0,"Everything about the band is like described. Leather, color like pictured, easy to install (if you find Youtube instructions, otherwise you will have no idea where to start). The reason for only 4 stars:<br />#1 - I bought THIS item because it had sizes to choose from - I have very small wrists. The so called S/M here is regular size, not smaller, so that's a disappointment.<br />#2 Instructions on how to replace the old band with this should be included  in the package."
4.0,I love how tight fitting it is!
4.0,Super cute dress! Fits great and is very comfortable. Get lots of compliments every time I wear it!
4.0,I order the dress XXL and it's fits like a XL. I happy I went a size up. Feels nice and the hoodie is nice and big.
4.0,Other reviews weren't kidding when they said order a size down. Well I am normally a large or a 10-12. Based on the reviews I decided to order two sizes smaller so I ordered a small. Good decision. The small fits perfectly and  doesn't feel tight or suffocating. It really smooths out the rolls and accentuates the curves. My only disappointment is that as you walk there is an annoying swish swish sound that is very loud and has the potential to be very embarrassing in public. My advice if your legs tend to rub you probably shouldn't buy this product.
4.0,Just received item so not sure about durability yet. Item is heavy and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. It is really pretty. Gold color is a nice bright yellow gold. The tool that was sent to me was not the one in pics. It is thinner and cheaper and it was a little hard to hold the band in place to remove links but it was do-able but the tool will not hold up like the thicker version pictured by seller.
4.0,The chain is short but Its beautiful and I love it
4.0,"Nice quality necklace.  Looks like gold, but cost a lot less.  A little too large for my taste."
4.0,A bit expensive but very well-made and designed all around. A heavier hoodie for sure. I gave 4 stars only because it was overpriced.
4.0,"This is really cute. I was expecting a thick, heavy sweater, but this is not real thick and heavy, which is great! It is soft and comfortable to wear. It is some what thin so I wear a shirt underneath it. It also has a slight shine to the material. Much cuter than the pictures show.<br /><br />The length is to short.  I bought a size large and the length from under the arm to the hem is 23 inches. The arm length from the shoulder to the wrist is 24 inches, but I wear it with leggings and boots like a long sweater as I do not wear short dresses, which is why I bought it anyway, and it looks really cute that way.<br /><br />The material is pretty stretchy so there is a lot of room for it to fit comfortable and with the type of material it is i think it will keep its stretch, not like a regular knitted sweater that if it gets stretched is no longer wearable. Although I think it might snag.<br /><br />I receievd this in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,"I‚Äôve purchased many of the Coofandy Line clothing, This particular shirt fits a little bit more snug than the others.  If you‚Äôre going for that tight muscular fit it‚Äôs perfect if you think it‚Äôs gonna be a little loose buy the size up."
4.0,"I dislike the fact they stretched out really quickly and now it's too loose to wear for practice, but they still work as good indoor shoes."
4.0,Very cute and comfy but size or two up. I ordered a Medium but feels more like a Small. I'm 5 4&#34; and 145 lbs size 8.
4.0,Loved my purse! It was a bit smaller than i thought but still enjoyed it. Wore it for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Wish the strap was longer!
4.0,I like these pants. They are comfortable and do stay in place. No muffin top. The material is nice and opaque but will show cellulite if you get them too tight. These are yoga pants and do not look or fit like slacks at all however...definitely should have gotten one size bigger. Im a solid 14(5'7) and the XL 32in is skin tight (as yoga pants should)....but I needed an inexpensive pant for my work uniform.... I will bump up to the xxl on my next purchase....
4.0,"Love the look of this bag but due to the metal on the strap, it hurts to wear it for any long period of time"
4.0,Jacket seemed a bit smaller than we expected but it is still really cute!
4.0,"These glasses are so comfy!! Not too heavy on my nose, and they look so nice. My only complaint is I thought they would be bigger. I‚Äôm a fan of oversized glasses and maybe it‚Äôs just my face but, they are not oversized."
4.0,"I wanted some real baltic amber after buying a fake necklace from somebody else. These might be small, but at least they are real. They came in a cute red pouch. one of these days I'll get a real necklace. All in all I like them."
4.0,Well I thought the gucci colors was right beside the lens as in the picture but they are still very nice glasses love them.......
4.0,"The fabric in this turban headband is a bit surprising - being a very lightweight knit.  But the second surprise is how comfortable it is when you‚Äôre wearing it! It‚Äôs perfect to hold your hair back during cleansing or giving yourself a facial.  I haven‚Äôt gone to the store in it yet - I‚Äôm using it so much for facial cleaning and moisturizing, that it is taking a permanent place in the bathroom!  Very pleased with this headband!"
4.0,"At first I thought they were a bit big but I adjusted to them quickly. They're light weight. I love them so much I wear them almost all the time. After about 1 yr, they started to turn. I just ordered another pair."
4.0,The colors are exactly as shown. Cute top for most people if they like poleyster and I wish I did. The feeling of it has always been a problem for me. We all have quirks and this one of mine. I love casual tops especially when you are freaking dressed up to work. So I said let's give it a try.  I'm not sorry I did because it's adorable and recommend it. My niece who's in her later twenties loves it so I gave it to her. Talk about fussy I couldn't believe she really likes it! It was a win win situation. Definitely recommend it.
4.0,"The print on this dress is great. That‚Äôs why I bought it. Quality is not the highest - the straps are thin string-like ties, and I did have it get a small rip in the seam the first time I wore it. I stitched it and am good to go though. This runs small like all the dresses I have from this brand. I‚Äôm a S but got a M as that was all they had. It‚Äôs a tiny bit snug around bust since you have that weird tie thing, but it still works. Plenty of space in the rest of the dress, just keep in mind if you‚Äôre busty or does run a tad tight there!"
4.0,"This pair was a whimsical purchase that met my expectations int Hat they were red and fit well on my head.  I'll admit these are not my go to glasses, but do the job when I'm feeling in the Bradly Cooper kinda of mood I sometimes find myself in.  I have lately been on the lookout for more of a Brad Pitt mood or late, but seem to be looking like more of a Cookie Monster type of demeanor."
4.0,"Got these for a photoshoot, just as the picture. They were a bit smaller than expected but not enough to be uncomfortable.  Definitely happy with this purchase."
4.0,These are really pretty. Smaller than I expected but really pretty. Loved the jewelry care email I got.
4.0,This ran a little small-  it is wicked cute so I'll be exchanging it!
4.0,"well made, but very short waisted.  I mean, VERY.  This would fit a petite."
4.0,These just came and I love them!! They came with a different bag/case then the picture but still really good sunglasses for so cheap. I would recommend these.
4.0,"Really cute, I am 5' 7&#34; and it is at least as long if not longer on me than the model in the pic"
4.0,"Not very heavy, but nice looking"
4.0,"This crew neck cutout is a perfect piece for fall and spring, as it allows you to go casual wearing a sweatshirt like material without looking like you're wearing sweats. The green sage color is really nice and uncommon color to have in a wardrobe so I appreciated that color as an option to add variety. The cutouts are done in a simple an elegant fashion and you can wear a bra with a normal size strap without it showing. The shirt is a bit looser than I had hoped and has an a-line cut that you can't notice from the picture. I would recommend this shirt for casual lounge wear.  Perfect for a lazy Sunday and running errands."
4.0,Material is nice smells a bit weird love the print. &#60;3
4.0,"I love the jacket. It is super cute. Exactly what I wanted. But unfortunately, I had to return it. I wear a 12-14 size or US large. I have smaller arms and chest, and ordered a XXL to be on the safe side for size, but it was still way to small in the mid section. I don't think even the 3x would fit me. I am so bummed."
4.0,"Omg it was sooo cute it was a little small around my breasts, but I was going to wear it at night. The material is very stretchy and the print is so cute. I might order another one for this year :)"
4.0,It's baggy and very comfortable.
4.0,"I ordered the smallest belt offered after asking other users if it would work for me as I am smaller (I wear a size 2 pant and small tops) but wanted to cinch my waist and lower back area to assist with the loss of an inch or two. I was told the belt would fit me, and it does... sort of. It is very long. I have to wrap it around more than one and a half times and it is hard to keep it pulled tight when it overlaps itself so much. However, once I get it on as snug as I can, it stays in place and does remain tight. I would recommend this product but I do think it would work better for someone who is a bit larger in size."
4.0,Was a gift for my granddaughter.<br />She wanted something simple for her cards for a keyring. Was very satisfied. Nice looking wallet.
4.0,Nice quality but too warm in Ca...thought it would be lighter material.
4.0,Purchase these and they were good quality for the price. Super comfy and cute. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and currently weigh 136lbs and purchased in medium.
4.0,"Ordered this a week and a half ago and received it yesterday, so it did come before its expected arrival, which is nice. However it did run small and from the picture I thought it was black or navy blue squares with a yellow background, but it turns out all the squares are purple. The skirt was made well, I guess. It felt like expensive Halloween costume material. The yellow is SO bright, and I'm sure it would look amazing on others, but it doesn't suit my skintone at all. The colors, while not for me, are extremely vibrant, so I can't fault them for that. The skirt is also very voluminous, but creases easily. I am only 5'2 and it was a bit short on me, so I can only imagine how short it would be on others taller than me.<br /> I am going to return it and get a full refund though, they got back to me within a day. So it's good customer service, which is why I gave it four stars instead of my initial 3."
4.0,"The lenses are enormous, just about comical, but they are so cute. Great for the beach."
4.0,Good sound quality and overall pretty comfortable. Easy to connect and comes in handy in the winter months. Would recommend!
4.0,There is only one thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars. The sweat block pad fell off within 48 hours.
4.0,Good made bag.
4.0,Looks very nice. Does not lose shape. Feels great. I will be getting another one in a different color. I have ovarian cancer and often stay in my pjs all day. I love this gown.
4.0,"I probably should have gotten a smaller size. I also purchased one that just comes up to the bra and I had to go up a size in that one. This I recommend going down since it's adjustable. This is probably the .ost comfortable pair I own.....my only complaint is that the hole in the crouch is so big that my thighs still run if I dont pull them up far enough, but that when it feels a little uncomfortable."
4.0,See through..still cute though. Wish the material was a little better quality.
4.0,I actually bought this dress from their website. Overall I live the dress. It was perfect for the black tie wedding I went too and I got tons of compliments. I felt like a million bucks. The biggest draw back was lacing it up and having the ties stick out the bottom. You basically have the option of leaving them out or tucking them it. Elimnating a butt bulge takes some times but you can get them flat.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with my purchase and would wear it again and buy again.
4.0,"Two of the three of these ended up having small defects. I wish they didn't. They were comfortable and flattering,  though a little see through. I ended up sending them back."
4.0,"Cute hat, the black glitter front one has a little logo on the side but this one is plain, it has black in the stitching on the brim. Not sure what it is."
4.0,"It looked awesome. Very sturdy. I had to return it, only because it didn‚Äôt properly fit my wrist. It was either too tight, or too loose. But an awesome band nonetheless"
4.0,"This is made out of a good quality material. However all the comments said it runs small, I usually wear a L or XL, so I got an XL and it was way too big and loose in the waist. Also, it made me look like a librarian.  Boo."
4.0,Just bought this handbag at Dillard's for $80.  Very well made but the dark brown is a little drab.
4.0,"This is quite pretty, fits nicely. Inexpensive for daily wear. Would recommend to anyone who wants a turquoise look without the high price."
4.0,Fits a little baggy like I wanted. Very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"overall good shoes, sizing runs big"
4.0,"They are snug on my 6 year old, but of mice quality. I recommend for kids around 40-50 lbs - my guy Just bumped up to size 7-8 and I‚Äôm worried these will not fit well all winter"
4.0,I ordered a 2XL fits great. Having longs arms its hard to find lo g sleeves that go AND stay at uour wrists. The collar is like a mini turtle neck which I like. As far as length goes a little past my belly button. Just wish there was more colors. :)
4.0,"This shirt fits well and the fabric is a good thin (not a see-through thin). My only complaint is about the button-able fabric straps used to keep the sleeves rolled up. To properly use them, I would have to roll the sleeves up way higher than I would like (a good 2-3 rolls above my elbow instead of just below, at, or just above it). And there's no way to keep the straps tucked up if you don't button them."
4.0,Best Bargain Bras for Bigger Breasted Buyers w/strap chap!
4.0,Fit nicely. Ties don‚Äôt stay tied very well.
4.0,This seemed to look different on me than it does in the picture. The slits seemed different and so did the off the shoulder part. It is good for the price and the seller is friendly.
4.0,"I work in an office that's dressy casual, and this shirt works very well for that. It's loose, but comfortable. Only issue is that it's quite sheer. For a looser fit, I think all you would need is a nude bra. For a tighter fit, I might wear a camisole underneath."
4.0,these are a Great Size !!
4.0,"Great glasses for the price. Deducting one star for not having more colors e.g. silver or gunmetal, but great product."
4.0,"The gold is a very yellow/orange gold and looks fake, but the earrings are simple and cute."
4.0,"This is just what I needed to travel.  Perfect for those places with pick pocketers.  Keep your currency safe, convienent, and is a stylish<br />wristlet!  Nice leather.  I bought the tan color. If you compare what others cost this genuine leather wallet is the right choice! Holds passports, boarding passes and I may put my slim cannon pocket camera in center fold since it is zip around wallet."
4.0,I always wear size 2 and 4 . This 4 is smaller than my other size 2's. Otherwise it is a nice product.
4.0,Little snug fitting but overall a great product
4.0,The fabric is not quality but not bad for the price
4.0,Love the fit and look of the sweater. Will probably wear it all if the time. However the initial smell is horrible like a barn. Took it to the dry cleaners. Hopefully that will help.
4.0,"Really comfortable, has stood up to lots of wear and tear with grace. Been washed a bunch and the shorts have maintained their color and the logo is in perfect condition. However, there is like a mesh underwear type thing sewn into the shorts which I was not expecting when I ordered. I havent had any problems with it and you could probably cut it out if you really wanted to."
4.0,"It actually holds boobs and the material is not uncomfortable. Size up though. I‚Äôm usually 32 DD Victoria Secret sizing or 34C regular size. I got a medium, but felt they were snug. I placed an order for a Large to see if that‚Äôs sizing is better."
4.0,"Great sunglasses, love the shape and build. Only issue is the material is a magnet for fingerprints and any oil you have on your face. Requires regular wipe downs but for the price it's well worth it."
4.0,"Very cute flowy top, love the layered look. Great price. Perfect for leggings and boots."
4.0,Fits great did not realize they had a draw string to make them tighter and a pocket for the excess string. Very convenient
4.0,Was a gift for my daughter and she loves it
4.0,"This shirt came exactly as described, I feel like the sizing was a bit off but not too terrible. I altered it myself to give it some flair so it wasn't just a tee with words. If you love The Craft this shirt is a must have it helps find other weirdos who have something in common with you."
4.0,I love the style of these. They are very comfortable. I was a little disappointed with the color. The frames are like a clear white and lenses aren‚Äôt really pink but can give of a pink tint.
4.0,"I really like this dress. I have the COVID 15 (gained 15lbs during COVID) and do not look great in most of my clothing. This dress covers up all my lumps nicely. It is longer and hits just above the knees. It has a great pattern on the top and bottom. It is also super comfortable. I ordered an XL, which is a bit big. I am 5'9"" and 175lbs. I could go down to a L. Overall, I think I will buy another dress in a different color, I like this dress so much."
4.0,"If you‚Äôre expecting these to be stretchy like I was....you‚Äôll be disappointed. It fits snuggly around my wrist which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but if you have unchildlike wrists unlike me, these will be tight. I‚Äôm used to using mine to fidget with and you can‚Äôt with these."
4.0,"small, but I love it on my wife!!!!!"
4.0,The fabric is thin but soft and flattering. I love this shirt. Only complaint is a little bit of the stiching popped open on my first wear. Can't even tell though.
4.0,Really well made bag just to small for my needs.
4.0,Very comfortable and warm. Not too big.
4.0,I purchased this vest as part of a Halloween costume for the white rabbit. For us this was perfect. It fit well and was a comfy fabric although it was only worn once it seemed sturdy and well made. It did remind me off a usher vest. It is not something I was consider for a dresser occasion or with a suit.
4.0,These fit my small face really well. They are a bit awkward around my ears but it's something I can put up with. I wear them daily.
4.0,"Fits great, XL's may be a little wide for the guys who need that size for their height but overall for the price my boyfriend loves it and wears it every other day.. He calls it his &#34;camo&#34; shirt!"
4.0,"I wore this in my engagement photos and loved it! It‚Äôs my new favorite skirt! Good fit and good price, especially if you are looking for a tulle skirt that is less ‚Äúpoufy‚Äù!"
4.0,It was what I expected but just a little smaller than I desired.
4.0,The bottoms were too big for my thin 4 year old. I had to order a plain pair in black in a small size so she could wear this.
4.0,Wear it for work and i love it
4.0,The bag design is nice<br />A little thin and doesn‚Äôt seem sturdy
4.0,Just Ok
4.0,It‚Äôs was great the only thing was that the cut of the lenses were not the same as the original but other than that pretty good for the price.
4.0,"(ordered the black live free or die trying I usually wear large but I ordered XL and was still small) I like this shirt but its very itchy and runs really small, it is super cute though."
4.0,I love the material used. It was easy to wear while being active
4.0,Received compliments!  Not the greatest material but very comfy and good for the price.
4.0,"The earrings are pretty, and I recommend them.  However, I have seen nicer looking crystal earrings.  I would give this a 4.5 if Amazon would let me give half-star ratings."
4.0,"The box I received the product in was a little beat up meaning that if you are giving this to someone who really takes in the whole experience it may distract them from the actual product itself.<br /><br />The necklace is nice, a good size without being too big and obvious. My only problem is with the design itself that the heart shape is actually convex and bends away from the person wearing it. It's slightly noticeable in the second product photo but otherwise is personal taste on whether or not this will also bother you or the wearer.<br /><br />Looks good, doesn't break the bank, and something special for that special beekeeping someone in your life. 4 Stars."
4.0,"It‚Äôs honestly a super cute set. The issue I had is that even the XS was too big on my waist and the booty line to accentuate came down too far because of my height lol. I love jetjoy and have many sets from them, this one just didn‚Äôt work out :("
4.0,I like the material and quality was ok. after one wear the clasp to the button to keep it closed at the top of the garnet broke! Now I have to spend money at the cleaners to have it fix.
4.0,I like them. Warm and waterproof
4.0,"In the right size this dress could be a showstopper. The build quality is pretty decent and the look of the dress is lovely. I bought this to have in my studio for clients and it photographs incredibly well. Just make sure you fit in it. So I suggest buying one size up and I don't know if this dress is really for you of you are over 5'3"" lol I really do love this dress just recommend you buy it one size up!"
4.0,This is a beautiful ring I absolutely love it.  It did come a little mis-shaped on the backside of the band.  But o took it to a jewelry to straighten it.  They did it free of charge.  Great rings overall
4.0,They are shimmery nails glued to a glove but it‚Äôs not sloppy. Cool for Halloween!
4.0,Very comfortable.<br />Effective.  Quickly become your favorites.
4.0,Could have been a bit bigger but decent overall ~
4.0,When I received this I was not sure how it would fit me. I am only 5'2 and most dresses hit me way below my knees - and so did this one. I really like the dress. The sizing was spot on and fit well. There is a slight stretch to it which is great. The only issue I have is the fact that I am short and unfortunately unable to grow anymore. I will be taking this dress to get shortened so that it will fit a little better. I definitely recommend this dress if you are looking for a more formal cocktail dress.
4.0,"I really like these.  Mine did come with one tie that was a little shorter than the other, but other than that, I love them.  =)"
4.0,"Pros:<br />-They stick like no other. The C4 rubber really puts my Evolvs to shame and lets me smear up slabs I couldn't before.<br />-The velcro makes it easy to slip on and off<br />-The stiff toes make for great edging<br /><br />The only con I can think of is perhaps inconsistent sizing. I tried these on in a store (at night when my feet were nice and bloated) and my street size was a good fit. When I bought the same size online, they were too tight (the width is perfect, but my toes start crying for freedom after 15 minutes). I've worn them 15+ times now and can't say they've stretched."
4.0,"I am a 32DDD long waisted 130 lbs build. I bought a Large. It fits pretty well. I can wear a bra or not. I like the lines but it's cheaply made. When I got it there were stitching strings hanging off of it. Oh well it was cheap. For reference, I bought the long sleeve -- one in black, one in white."
4.0,"I ordered two of these, in the same size. I ordered the army green and mustard yellow both in an XXL because I wanted them to be loose and wearable with leggings and skinny jeans. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 180‚Äôs right now and 36C. Let me start by saying the colors are great and spot on. No worries there. Next, they are soft and lightweight with the larger waffle weave as pictured which was refreshing because in the past I have been burned and ordered large waffle weave tops pictured and received a tight knit weird looking tops that was nowhere close to the photo from another seller. So the photo is accurate! This seller is great. Now... where this fell short for us was sizing. The army green was sized correctly but the yellow was at least 2 sizes too small. Super frustrating because they should both fit the same. I ended up giving the mustard to one of my teenage daughters who wears a M women's top and is around 155lbs. Despite being happy to give this to my daughter, I feel really disappointed sizing was inconsistent between colors because I want this in mustard myself. Keep that in mind when purchasing. Otherwise, they are great tops! Super cute, soft, can be dressed up or down, easy to wear and washing is a breeze. Wash on cold delicate and hang over a chair to dry! Dries FAST!"
4.0,I'm 5'7 and 156 lbs . I choose a large size and it fit really good . :-)
4.0,make shure you order the correct size
4.0,"unfortunately I found out too late that I needed to order a larger size if the product comes from Asian countries. However the jacket is constructed well, and looks just like the image. IF I lost a few pounds it would be perfect."
4.0,Cute dress but it way to big I order a large and had to return I were 8
4.0,This dress looked absolutely amazing and totally flatters your body but it is way too small in the chest. If you don't have an A or B cup then don't bother because if it fits your chest the rest will be way too baggy. The fabric is a little cheap too. I am a double D and almost ripped it..
4.0,"The gloves were beautiful, soft, and accurately depicted.<br />My only complaint and reason for returning them, is that they smelled awful. I couldn‚Äôt wash my hands enough to get that smell off of them after wearing them.<br />Not sure if the smell was from the leather or cashmere. At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt care what the cause is. That smell was horrible."
4.0,"I really like my grid-it for organizing things, and it's definitely really good quality - but it's also heavy for it's size - it'd be even better if it were more light-weight"
4.0,"love it, looks great on."
4.0,"Cute and my daughter can't wait to snuggle her feet into them!  I bought these to use as her classroom slippers this fall/winter (her school requires that outdoor shoes be left in the hallway and classroom slippers be used).  I wanted to get her shoes that were sturdy feeling and comfortable.<br /><br />These are great and I am hoping they hold up well this school year.  I did deduct one star because I got a size 12 (she's about a 12-13 in size depending on the brand and type of shoe) and these are loose in the heel area (they flop off the back of her foot as she walks).  I am hoping that as long as we wait to use these later in the fall and when she has socks on, the fit will be OK.  I know if I had purchased an 11, they would have been too small for her."
4.0,"It's pretty but it's not what I expected so I'm sending it back.  The fit was good and the dress itself is pretty. It would be great for a Cruise or an outdoor social on a hot summer day.  I am a 34c and it's very revealing.  The tail is quite long if you are 5'3"" especially if you wear a flat sandal.  If you get it, I would plan on wearing with a wedge or a casual open-toed heel.<br />My dress also arrived with some of the stitching coming loose at the waist on both sides.  I snapped a picture of that as well. If I kept the dress, i would have just stitched that back up."
4.0,Super soft. Sadly I am returning due to it didn't suck my tummy in enough which is why I needed it for. Maybe in a few months I can exercise some fat off then I might be back.
4.0,Great sandals. Fit nicely and love the support and comfort. They seem to be made well. The only reason I didn't give these a 5 star is because they were packaged in a draw string plastic bag. Because of the that.....the foot straps on the left sandal were wrinkled. But when I wear them it straightens out and looks fine. I would have preferred then to be packaged in a box. I love the brown color as well. Look forward to wearing them all day to the county fair.
4.0,I got this dress for my daughters senior prom. The dress was beautiful! If came within the expected ship date which was a plus. The material was nice and the dress fit great everywhere else except for the chest area. It was a little tight. It was like it didnt have enough material to cover her enough. Considering it was a plunging neckline. We really had to tape her in. All in all it was a good choice. Money well spent.
4.0,Corte perfecto
4.0,They will definitely keep your hands warm but thats all they're good for.  Can't hardly touch anything and they attract dust bad. I didn't care about the touch stuff i only bought em to keep my hands warm and they do that perfectly. Worth every penny
4.0,"Cute dress, very light material. Made for the taller ladies. Overall good buy"
4.0,"Made me look like an aging elf, but it‚Äôs darling on my daughter. Guess I‚Äôm just too old to do hipster."
4.0,"I have one complaint.  They are strung with white thread instead of black which makes them look like I strung them myself.  The pearls themselves are  beautifully high lustre, very lightly scarred, a lovely hint of green, and I love the clasp.  Pretty to look at on, I can't wait to wear them."
4.0,Beautiful pendant. The Sapphire was darker than what is pictured. Still a nice pendant.
4.0,"It was slightly larger than expected, but that is better than the other way around."
4.0,Thank you I finally received my watch it is better than I expected. It's a long wait but it worthy.
4.0,A little bigger than expected but very nice to wear on my uniform in honor of my father who passed.
4.0,"Very compact wallet, can barely feel it in my pocket. Haven't had it long enough to commwnt on durability. I like the minimalist style"
4.0,"The leather piece is surprisingly cushy and comfortable to wear; I usually forget it's on my wrist when I'm wearing it.<br /><br />A very pretty little piece. Easy to adjust.<br /><br />It's not real turquoise, of course, but it is still nice."
4.0,Great buy! But I bought the wrong size :(
4.0,"They look exactly as pictured and feel durable.  The only problem I had with them is that they are hard to clean and aren't for people who recently got their ears pierced since they tend to trap bacteria, are a little heavy and unbalanced, and are hard to clean."
4.0,Very nice jewelry.  Very happy with purchase.
4.0,I really like the idea of these rings but they unfortunately run very small so they are going back. I wore them for a day on my pinky finger to get an idea of how they feel and would order them in a larger size. I have arthritis in my fingers so regular metal rings which go over my knuckles slide around on my finger. They have just enough give to go over the knuckles but the silicone is slightly clingy so they don't roll around or move once in place. I like the band thickness and the overall comfort. The colors are as pictured but it would be nice to have design options to make them look less utilitarian. I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.
4.0,A little bit stiffer than other bands I've had but still nice!
4.0,I LUCK THAT
4.0,It was cute. My daughter put it on her birthday registry and she loved it.
4.0,"Looks very dapper against a solid shirt and jacket, but the paisley is pretty prominent. Not a subtle pattern in my opinion. Looks very nice on my husband!"
4.0,"These were great, but to small. I bought the other style of neoprene goggle  straps before and they were ok fit, these are cut very small I thik. I bought 3 size large junior for age 3-8.  My grand kids are normal size and weight for ages  3, 6, and 7 but all of the mask/ goggles were to small. I had hoped there would be a way to enlarge but received no response ce from seller that that might be possible. They were well made, very fun and good quality. I hope seller comes up with larger sizes next year and notes circumference in description."
4.0,I have only just tried it on and have yet to actually seriously wear it but as a first corset purchase I like it.
4.0,"Great comfortable shoe, after wearing a few times the front started coming apart and dis coloring, but for the price very worth only being able to wear for a few months"
4.0,"These goggles get the job done. They have not leaked a drop so far and are comfortable around my eyes. They are very easy to adjust and very easy to put on. They also provide great UV protection. I only have 2 issues with these goggles: I would rather them have a double strap to make it more comfortable around my head (I have a big head) and once I go underwater, it goes blurry. Not terrible blurry, but noticeable. I'm not sure if you can tell, but the outside of the lenses have a mirror finish to them. It's not an issue at all, just thought I would mention it."
4.0,I was skeptical about these fitting when I first got them. I probably should have ordered one size bigger just because I prefer them a little looser. Overall I do like them & would buy more.
4.0,"Tail worked good, but the ears even with clips wouldnt stand up. The ears kept falling down."
4.0,"1/8/2022 - Upgraded to 4 stars<br />My replacement pack arrived earlier than expected. Bumping up to four stars. I don‚Äôt have to work as hard to get the 3 black connectors to slide into the watch but they still require some effort, which is why I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars. I would recommend these considering the price is right, the connectors can be worked with, the colors are good and the loop feels just as comfortable as the genuine apple band when wearing. Hope this helps.<br /><br />12/29/2021 - Upgraded to 3 stars<br />I have re-ordered the same pack and will not receive the new pack until February. In the meantime I was desperate and tried to make these work for three reasons. 1.) The size is right. It‚Äôs hard to find third party solo loops that are small enough for my wrist. 2.) The price is right. 3.) I like the colors. Here is what I‚Äôve learned in trying to make them work. The three black connectors aren‚Äôt near as smooth as the connectors on the apple bands. Some were raised in a way that wouldn‚Äôt even allow the band to slide in. I started pressing on them and they will actually go farther into the band so they don‚Äôt stick out as high and you can slide them into the watch. It takes some trial and error. One actually fell out completely and I was able to put it back in. I wish they were more solid and didn‚Äôt require extra work to fit, but for 5 at $15 I‚Äôm willing to do a little work. Moving from 1 star to 3 stars since you can actually get them to work, but you have to put effort into it. If the pack I re-ordered works flawlessly I will update my review to reflect so.<br /><br />12/22/2021 - 1 Star<br />I was very excited to receive these based on the reviews I read. Unfortunately, the three connectors were sticking up too high to the point that they didn‚Äôt easily slide into the watch or they didn‚Äôt slide in at all. Then one of them fell out completely. I love solo loops and it‚Äôs been hard to find good non-apple ones. I may order another set of the same to see if I get luckier. As of right now I can‚Äôt recommend. If I order another set and they are different I will update this review."
4.0,Good for the winter can shrink when wash
4.0,"Love the item, however my soon to be 5 year old typically wears a 4T/5T and this item is WAY to big for her, we have to saftey pin the back. Other that the large size the product looks great and made decent. She loves it and that's what matters!"
4.0,"Nice soft strap, pops on watch.. Only problem -1 star was the pins are too small.. I wasn't able to use included pins with watch, had to use my own spring bars.. Put them next to my own 18`s and they were just a tad shorter.. If i didn't always change straps and didn't have extra bars, this would been 1 star review..."
4.0,Cute warm hat. I never thought I looked very good in a beanie but this style looks better I think. Some commented that it was too large on top or cone head. I have an average size head and just tucked the very little bit of looseness in behind the large ribbed band.
4.0,"I really love this dress! It fits me well and it has a very unique collar, cuff, and hem line.  I got the burgundy color and it is beautiful. Comfortable and drapes my body nicely. It will be great for church services in winter. :) The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because it DEFINITELY bleeds in the wash! But that's to be expected from a red/purple garment! I washed it alone in cold water with a color catcher and it left the garment bag all pink! Ha! I'll continue washing it alone so that's a little annoying but not a big deal for such a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Yeah, they are probably stronger than the plastic ones, but they are also heavier, and bend, and seem weird when you put them on.<br /><br />On the other hand, the clips are metal with rubber-like boots at the end of the clips, and they don't look that bad actually.<br /><br />As clip-ons go, these work, and I will buy more.<br /><br />Seeing as how I lost/ bent / scratched up three in a year."
4.0,"Thread was a little shredded, wish it was longer but okay overall."
4.0,A little tall
4.0,Quality is excellent. However I ordered a 4XL for my dad and it‚Äôs way too small.
4.0,I really like this and helps to be able to wear the essential oils especially when im out and have a headache ect. I would have given 5 stars but i personally would like more of a shiny finish.
4.0,"I'm not a big review writer, but I couldn't find too much information on this, so I figured I'd contribute. I was looking for a very small backpack that didn't look like a technical camera bag. I have backpacks, but I wanted basically a camera messenger bag, with space for a few small non photography items, that carries like a backpack.  More like a rucksack I guess. I also didn't want black.  There are very few options out there like this. This was the best I could find and thankfully it's well made, functions pretty well and it looks really good too. And the price wasn't outrageous.<br /><br />First off,  I was planning on getting the blue, but glad I went with orange as a last minute change of mind. If I were buying the larger Dalston, I would go with a more subdued color so I don't look like a beacon. The color is exactly as pictured and is very chic and modern, but not particularly wild looking.<br /><br />The nylon feels very durable and weather resistant. It has a very slight rubberized coating that improves the feel and look of the fabric. The padding in the back and shoulder strap is perfectly sufficient for this type of bag. It's not a hiking pack. It's quite comfortable and helps maintain the urban casual look of the bag. The zippers all feel high quality, but the main weather sealed zipper is a little hard to use one handed. It's smooth and tracks fine, just kind of stiff.<br /><br />The Camera compartment is fairly stiff (in a good way) and padded so it feels very protective. I was a little worried that it wouldn't have the capacity that I was looking for, but it's actually nearly perfect for what I need. A Canon R with RF 24-105L attached fits like a glove with maybe an inch of depth to spare. I also can fit a 17-40L with adaptor attached and 1-2 small primes or a full sized flash. All in the camera section. I wish it had a flap to divide one of the three compartments in half, but that's a pretty small complaint. Two of the three compartments are about 3.5""x7.75"" deep with the top one being closer to 2.75x7.75"" as I have it configured.  The interior of the bag is probably closer to 9"" deep from the side, so  A bigger telephoto would fit, but might be a stretch.  If you wanted, you could certainly put such a lens in the top compartment. Because the camera access is a straight zipper instead of the usual ] shape, it can be slightly tight getting the camera in and out. Not too bad at all really, but I do worry that the zipper could eventually scratch the finish on the camera or lens.<br /><br />One big surprise for me is that there is a laptop sleeve inside behind the camera section. I saw that in the description, but I thought it was a mistake as I thought only the Dalston had this. I was hoping that an ipad mini would fit in the passport compartment ( it won't, it's only 5"" deep), but it actually already had what I wanted. A 13"" Macbook pro fits, but it's a little tight getting it in and out because of the zipper design. A tablet is a better use for this compartment imo. The flat front compartment is useful and fairly roomy, but I wish that it had two mesh pockets like the dalston instead on the single one here. There certainly appears to be room for two. Overall, I could wish for a few more organizing pockets. I love bags in general and a lot of that has to do with all the nooks and crannies they have. This is a little lacking in that department, but it doesn't really change my feelings about the bag.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it is a sling. I knew up front that it was a sling so I'm not holding that against it, but I'm not a huge fan of this arrangement. Unfortunately, there were so few options like this that I had to compromise a little. I'm sure I'll get used to it and it does work well and is really easy to swing around to the front. On the positive side, the little cross strap and the piece that it connects to on the shoulder strap are removable so you don't have nylon straps hanging everywhere if you aren't using them.<br /><br />My background is in design- not fashion or apparel, but if I were designing this bag, I would have made it a backpack with the ability to snap or velcro down flat one or the other of the shoulder straps. That way it is a backpack or sling as desired. The main strap is the perfect thickness for doing this, ie. not too thick. And the location of the cross strap and it's connection point on the shoulder strap are perfect for adding a second set on the other side and making them dual use as a waist belt and chest strap or remove half of them, secure one shoulder strap and use it as a sling with a cross strap. F-Stop if you're listening...."
4.0,The colors are great.  I ordered med/large and they seem okay maybe a bit large but I was afraid the small/med may be too tight. Good quality material.  I would order again but maybe get the sm/med.  I guess it depends on how tight you want your leggings to fit.
4.0,Comfortable and well worth the price.
4.0,"I bought the black/gray/maroon capri leggings.  I am 5'10"" and 165lbs and normally wear a size 12 or large in leggings, so based on other reviews, I sized up to xl.  I'm glad I did, because all 3 leggings fit differently!  The gray pair is loose, the black pair is perfect, and the red pair (which I thought would be a little darker and not blood red) was okay around the waist, but loose around the bottom.  Like other reviewers noted, it does have a rather obnoxious waistband which is just a thick piece of elastic that hits above my belly button.  This is another reason I'm glad I sized up!  I just fold it down.  I gave these four stars because I do like the big pocket which will hold my keys and my Samsung Galaxy, and I like the length....even though they ride up at the bottom.  Would I buy these again?  The black pair definitely yes, but the way the other two pairs fit...probably not.  They are decent for the money.  Oh and btw, they are NOT compression leggings.  They're super stretchy and a little on the thin side.  They'll hide your undies, but not much else."
4.0,Lovely light dress! You‚Äôll need a undergarment as the fabric is not totally transparent but somewhat so for sure. Easy to wear and travel. üòé
4.0,I wear small and I buyed the small size. Fit exactly.
4.0,I really like these nice and comfy just what I was looking for item arrived on time and looked just like the product shown.
4.0,"Arrived quick. Strap locks are decent. Quality is good but the strap ends are cheap material and will probably crack, split and break over time. Also the strap is a bit short for my liking. Design pattern is cool though. It will serve it's purpose for a while"
4.0,Cool idea not the best quality
4.0,"Fits as expected. I'm 5'6 and 160lbs and bought a large. It fits well but if you like loose fitted dreeses, you may want to go a size up. The material is a little stretchy but may shrink and is also see through so I rated 4 stars due to that. Will look cute over a swimsuit for sure."
4.0,Just got this purse in the blue.  Love it.  It is light weight.  Lots of pockets.  Only problem is that I am not sure about the zippers.  Sometimes they don't go very smoothly.
4.0,"Love this blouse! Fits loose, but still has shape. It is not clingy, so looks great for those of us that have a few extra pounds around the middle."
4.0,Great shirt. Purchased for my Grandson.  Shirt runs large. Excellent price.
4.0,iconic watch
4.0,Looks professional material is nice so comfortable and actually really flattering did run a little big but the fact that you have to be careful not to have to tight either
4.0,"Item as described. A little difficult to adjust with one hand but once you get it stable, it is very pretty on the wrist."
4.0,"Got an XL, it fit snug but I'm built wide so it was everything I expected."
4.0,"after reading reviews I ordered two sizes larger, would not have worked at regular size"
4.0,This was very blingy which is what I was looking for but I thought it was too thick.  I was looking for something with a thinner material.
4.0,"This is classic the right size fits perfect. Looking fly on this one, good material."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d231142fa337b06db75647705b3ff59a]] It's a nice little tennis bracelet. I'm not a jeweler or anything. I don't know what makes a good piece, costume or not. This bracelet comes in a regular jewelry box (pictured) and looks nice right out of the box (video). There is an extra clasp with a small section of bracelet between the two clasps which can be removed for thinner wrists. I thought THAT was an interesting feature.<br />Even I can tell that gold is not real gold. It is far too ""orangey."" I docked the single star for that color. I've set a date in my calendar to update this review three months from now. Costume jewelry is tricky. Sure, like I said, it looks great out of the box; but, how does it look three months down the road? Does it turn one's wrist green? Does the gold chip away or turn black? We will see when my calendar alerts me."
4.0,"I usually buy Extra Large when ordering on line because a lot of clothes run small and I have broad shoulders.  However, this one is a true extra large and I could have worn a large in this top.  However, it's not so large I want to send it back."
4.0,These came fast. And best is they are adjustable to fit kids and adults
4.0,Queda muy bien pero es transparente y no se aprecia asi en las fotos.
4.0,I bought this primarily for the top - it was appealing to have a loose fitting tankini.  I LOVE the top...I did order a size or two larger than usual & the cups are a bit big but it fits just fine/stays in place & the loose tankini is just like in the photo.  The bottom however is not big enough for me at all.  I ended up buying another bottom to go with the top.
4.0,Like em a lot only thing is they are a little itchy but definitely worth it :)
4.0,"This is a great bag. It is spacious but actually not too big. The removable center is unique. The real is lovely. I have received compliments. It looks like an expensive bag. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is the main body of the purse is not lined. Other than that the bag is great and I really like it. I am really pleased with my purchase."
4.0,Shirt could be longer
4.0,Love them all!! I was a bit worried it might be too small but turns out it was the perfect size.
4.0,This dress is very comfy and casually cute.
4.0,Beautiful. Will recommend<br />Was buy for gift
4.0,Fit well and is quality materials.  Would be a 5 star except the price was on the high side of normal.
4.0,Sleeves would be cuter is they didn‚Äôt have a bell /flared like appearance.
4.0,Comfy but fit's small.  Order one size up.
4.0,"I am usually a small, but after reading the other reviews I ordered a medium. Made the right choice, it fits perfect.<br />I bought this in black and you can see through if against the light."
4.0,This is a great case for iPhone 7. I am a fan of Japanese art so this case is perfect for me. The case fits as expected. No real issues with the case. Will recommend it!!
4.0,"Nicely finished, clean. Band is average nevertheless leather. I found that accuracy is not that great and seems to vary widely with the position of the watch. Overall good value for the money"
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, fits perfectly! Love the color too doesn‚Äôt like fake!"
4.0,"Very nice dress for a summer or for evenings. My wife loves this dress and is a perfect fit for her. Very well designed and material quality is very soft. The dress length is perfect, not a see through and pockets are very helpful. Elastic wait is very helpful to hold the dress correctly. I would definitely recommend this dress, its beautiful."
4.0,This stone is beautiful. Making a wire wrapped pendant.  Will buy more soon. Amazon have a nice selection to choose from.
4.0,"these are as expected.. I will tell you more after I have gone to the eye doctor's to see if my prescription can actually be put into this frame.  Update:  Yes, prescription was put into this frame... problem is it is very difficult to adjust the frame to set straight on my face.... other wise they are great!"
4.0,"Bought this as a gift to my wife for our 10th anniversary.  She absolutely loved it!  Unfortunately, the included chain isn't of the highest quality and the clasp failed after wearing just a few times.  Bought another chain to replace.  Oh, and since it isn't pictured/mentioned - the back of the medallion is textured, so if you are thinking of getting it engraved that isn't really an option."
4.0,"These bracelets are great for the price, and the packaging is fabulous! My sole issue is that the elastic is tied off right next to the single different colored gem, so on the black bracelet there is a black elastic knot right by the white gem, and on the white bracelet there is a clear/white knot right by the black gem. It probably doesn't show to anyone else, but looking down at it, it bugs me lol (see pics). If they had tied it off between two coordinating gems it wouldn't have shown nearly as much, if at all, but this is a minor point of dissatisfaction. :) I'm overall very happy with the purchase!"
4.0,"They are comfortable, but are a little larger than expected. The pads move around after being washed, but it is easy to adjust them. Good quality product!"
4.0,"I wore this wig to a comic con as Leia in her senatorial gown. It fits my head perfectly, but I don't have a lot of hair to stuff in it. That may make a difference. At a passing glance, many people thought it was my real hair. Of course when you look closely, you can tell it's a wig. After wearing it a few times, some strands are coming loose from the buns, but there's still a few cons and Halloweens left in it!"
4.0,The one thing I don't like is that the pins are loose and easy to lose.  Otherwise its good.
4.0,This swim suit is super cute. I have a curvy body type. Im 5‚Äô3 160 and an XL fits perfect. I normally wear a medium or large. So I suggest going a size up.
4.0,This hat is adorable - it came quickly.
4.0,"This is a nice blouse that will be very trendy for spring 2019, it fits nicely on the shoulders but the fabric could've been of better quality. Love me some polka dots im glad they are back in style."
4.0,Love the idea but sits low and pushes my ears out
4.0,"This material is incredibly soft and is good at retaining warmth. The main problem that I see is that the material is thin and you would need to wear a nude underwear with this material if you‚Äôre wearing one of the lighter colors. It is high waisted and a tux in your belly pretty nice, if the material was a bit thicker and not as hot I would probably give it another go."
4.0,Sent it to my dad for Father's Day. Got to him with great timing and fit great!
4.0,"Great bag! My 3 year old daughter uses it to house her fake makeup and hair products! The actual bag iw good quality, but like others said, the straps are fairly cheap. I knew that going into it though and so that doesnt bother me!"
4.0,It was too small for my wife to wear
4.0,Fit my 90 lb 4‚Äô5‚Äù daughter just fine.
4.0,These earrings are the perfect size and are very comfortable with the silicone back and good quality. I would buy again. I'm happy with this purchase. Very pretty earrings.
4.0,"I ordered the mocha but, received the stone.  I would have sent it back but, I do like the lightweight, comfort for spring and summer.  I plan to order again, in the mocha and hopefully, they will send the correct item as, ordered."
4.0,"Nice purse, does what it needed to do."
4.0,Very comfortable. Love the elastic waistband. Memories sweet memories!
4.0,"Bought it for my brother. It was installed very easily & has held up for several weeks now. It's more like a thin aluminum material, but still sturdy once stuck to the watch. He works construction & hasn't had it fall of this far. The only thing is he knocked it against a wall & scuff off some of the painted numbers. . One can still read it ok. The linked band that came with it is nice as well. Very manly. Definitely recommend."
4.0,"I love this top so much, except that it puckers a little at the bottom button‚Äînot enough to bother me a whole lot. Wanted to repeat the great fit and fabric, though, and went to order another like it in the navy blue with green. They are not alike! The material isn't soft and flowy like the red one; it's stiff and not as beautifully fitting. Returning that one."
4.0,Awesome price a bit smaller than I thought I would give it a 5 but I had to chip off a lot of polishing wax.
4.0,The face of the watch is a lot bigger than I expected.
4.0,"Good short , runs big ."
4.0,I like the shoe but they fit larger than expected. Should have ordered small size.
4.0,As advertised and arrived on time. No issues with the fit and they are for winter riding.
4.0,This fits more like a body con dress than I expected. I was hoping it would have a little bit of room but it fits pretty snug. I would size up to get the extra room if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.
4.0,great quality as in all russell products
4.0,I believe I should‚Äôve gotten a smaller size but I loveeeeeee this shirt!
4.0,Sleeves are really big but overall a good fit.
4.0,"They run a little big, but with thick socks it's not too bad."
4.0,Very cute dress! I am 5‚Äô5 and 240lbs and I ordered 1X and it‚Äôs a touch big because it‚Äôs so stretchy. But it‚Äôs super cute and not too big that I won‚Äôt wear it. Recommend!
4.0,pretty but i'm not quite sure their worth the price i paid for them.  For some reason expected them to be a little larger.
4.0,"I little bigger than I expected in the front but the back is super cute! The padding moves around so that's pretty annoying but it's a supportive workout bra overall. I'm 125lbs, 5'6' a 34C."
4.0,"This suit is pretty good.  I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 34D, 39-29-40, and it‚Äôs moderately flattering.  I think I got a 12<br /><br />The chest has real cups, and the waist cinches well.  The only thing I‚Äôd chance is adding more ruching toward the lower belly.  I have an older Jena from miraclesuit which I adore, and this one is only slightly less flattering."
4.0,I bought this dress for a vacation to Cabo San Lucas and I am 5 foot 11 and 175 lb and absolutely love this dress! It's not only sexy but totally flattering and super comfortable and I'm trying to figure out if I can buy more of them with different stripe options or similar style? Not sure how I can do that but I give it a total thumbs up!!
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Says it is comfortable and is easy to put on. Can be easily thrown on to keep warm or to lounge in around the house.
4.0,Liked the different modes and fits well on small children. Like the other features on the face.<br />We did not like that the date was hard to set.
4.0,Very nice<br />Run a little small wear size 8 got size 9 perfect fit.
4.0,Better compare to expensive brands.
4.0,nice {J's
4.0,"Great product!  as described, great shipping speed.  I will shop from this seller again for sure!"
4.0,"This was beautiful, but I‚Äôm a little disappointed on how small it fit on my kiddos‚Äô heads. My six-year-old fit into it but my eight-year-old already had it fitting too small.<br /><br />The light comes out easily from the beanie, so you could charge it using a USB-C cord, and you could plug-in the cord into a socket that goes into the music buttons.<br /><br />The light switches from light, extra bright, and then red and blue, alternating lights.<br /><br />I‚Äôm only docking this is star because of how much smaller it ended up being for a kid hat."
4.0,"The earrings are beautiful, lightweight, and appear to be well-made, especially for the price; however, when they arrived, the posts were bent sideways in the flat envelope (probably from being mishandled during shipping). I heated them with a blow dryer and straightened them back out, but now the posts have an unsightly &#34;twist.&#34; I have to take off a star for them arriving in less-than-pristine condition, but the size, color, etc. of the earrings is great. I just hope no one else who orders these has the same issue; I'd hate to think that someone might accidentally break off one of the posts trying to straighten them back out..."
4.0,They are really nice well made belts BUT they aren't sized for women who are average to large size. Anyone above 32 waist CANNOT use this belt even though it says it will fit up to a 33 waist.
4.0,They looked very classic and cute with my son's smocked Easter attire.
4.0,The dress is too short.. it was a nice fit.
4.0,My wife try them on and she‚Äôll like them so we‚Äôre satisfied for the purchase
4.0,"I got the snowman pattern to wear on Christmas morning. Very cute and comfy. Material is thin, don‚Äôt wear them if you want to stay warm. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 173lbs. I followed the size chart and ordered the XXL. They fit nicely, although a little snug in the waist and butt area. They are also long on me, but I‚Äôm shorter with short legs. They are cute and fun to wear on Christmas."
4.0,Casual t-shirt dress I really like it just above the knee
4.0,"I am not a professional cleaner -- just an older woman with a large house. I like that this apron is lightweight since I live in a hot, humid climate. A canvas apron would be too hot to wear, much less work in. I don't load my apron down since I don't use that many cleaners in my home. I'm not sure what the two metal rings are, but they do not work for me. After putting the apron on, they both wind up in the middle of my back. Whatever I put there would not be convenient. This is only an issue because I am not very big around the waist area. Other than that, I have been happy with this apron and recommend for someone who needs a lighter weight cleaning apron."
4.0,A gift to my wife over a year ago - she love its to this day nothing has come loose.
4.0,Very light  good for summer
4.0,"Awesome brushed metal finish. A great weight, but just a bit bigger thanI expected. Still a great product."
4.0,"This is a very nice stylish watch that you can wear on certain occasions, the watch is very light, removing the link's was easy, although I did use my own tools, the tool that came with the watch wasn't getting the job done, I had to take off 3 link's to get the perfect fit, to keep the band locking peace centered be sure to remove links on both sides. The watch is a nice size for casual wear, it's not really a big face watch like any Invicta style watches it's more like a average style Timex watch, it's just your basic analog watch with the time and date, the crystal's on the inside and around the face is what makes it stand out because of any light reflection it will shine, truthfully, the crystal's should've only been on the inside because the outside one's makes it look like almost costume jewelry, that's why I will only wear it on certain occasions just because of it's luxury look, it's not a sports watch or a everyday go to watch, it's just a nice shiny bling out fashion statement that's meant to enhance your appearance when you get all dressed up, this particular watch is all about coordinating and fashion, that's it, that's all, don't treat it like it's anything other than what it is, everything seems to be good and sturdy and it do keep accurate time, the only thing you will have to change is the battery whenever it runs out, that's it. If you're the type that has plenty of watches, this should be a very nice addition to your collection."
4.0,I own a pair of Phillip lug harness boots made by frye I had to order a size 10 Because a 10.5 was too big. I think frye boots run about a half size bigger.
4.0,Runs a little small even for a 5 year old. He says they are tight.
4.0,Loved the design and colors.  Fit as expected.
4.0,I like the product but 2X was still too small for me. They fit somewhat tight around the waist but they do stretch pretty well. I suppose I am going to have to go to another brand with 3X or 4X. The material is comfortable. I just didn't know how big I have actually become.
4.0,Very festive and worth the money. Well made. They are a tiny bit too heavy but will be fine as long as I‚Äôm not making real quick movements. For the every day where they are just fine for the holidays and really cute.
4.0,"The quality of this wig is AMAZING!  We received many compliments.  I bought it for my 3 year old daughter and the texture and everything is great.  It is a little hard to get on, but is great once secured.  Would buy again,"
4.0,"These are pretty earrings at a good price, but the clasp is hard to close. The post that goes thru the ear is short which doesn't leave a lot of fastening room. Although they were not listed as being for children, I thing they we do better with a tinier ear lobe."
4.0,This blouse has a nice design but the material is thin. The quality is not what I desired but it was worth keeping so I did.
4.0,"Great shirt...slightly tighter than expected, but that could be because I am a woman.  It still looks good, and my students love when I wear it!"
4.0,I got this for my grand baby but the size is for older kids not  toddlers
4.0,I had already bought the shorts. I just wanted a different color. They fit just right. They are very comfortable.
4.0,"Cute. Probably won‚Äôt last long but for the price definitely worth it for a few wears. Was a little big but that‚Äôs my fault, I never know what size to order in rings."
4.0,"Fit as expected, it is adjustaable after all. My wife loves it so much she always borrows it from time to time"
4.0,This is a beautiful piece
4.0,Was just what I was looking for.! Looks amazing.! I am very satisfied with this product.! Thank you.! Would buy again.!
4.0,Came with a tool but can't figure out how to make band smaller but absolutely love the band..
4.0,"My best friend bought the blue one for my birthday. I love this robe so much. It‚Äôs extremely soft and comfortable to wear. However, my only issue is that the pockets tear very easily. So hopefully they will fix that issue. Other than that it‚Äôs an excellent robe."
4.0,"For the price I paid, this dress is a good value. It's very form fitting, so may not be suitable for all situations."
4.0,"Cute little black dress. Can wear to work or out. I'm 5'2&#34; and 120-125lbs and I sized up to a size M. Fits perfectly, not too short or tight. Fabric isn't the best but what you can expect for the price. Would buy again!"
4.0,My husband loved these. They scratch kind of easy though.
4.0,"I'm FTM and this is WAY easier to use than a traditional strap-on. My gal agrees! You can even wear boxers or briefs over them while packing or &#34;playing.&#34; For chubbier or bigger people, I would suggest the boxer brief version because these may be a little shorter cut."
4.0,Great glasses for driving at night or bright sunny day
4.0,Perfect post surgery
4.0,Colour not as vivid as I expected for a cobalt blue.
4.0,I love it ! It‚Äôs comfortable and something different. Only thing is is slides a little bit and it can be painful so I adjust it often. That‚Äôs just me though everyone is different !
4.0,"Beautiful!  Taking out links was difficult, and the tool sent with it broke.  Took to watch repair and they helped for a few bucks.  I love the look."
4.0,They were actually too big
4.0,"I usually wear a size 6 or 8 in dresses and the large was very loose on me. It was a cute style, felt nice on, and the blue is as pictured. I eneded finding a dress for my event elsewhere so I didn't re-order in smaller size."
4.0,"This is a comfortable bra that I‚Äôve been wearing a lot through pregnancy. It‚Äôs affordable and looks a little nicer under clothes than some other nursing bras I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôm unsure about the durability of the product though, as it‚Äôs started to pull after a few months of use. And an odd thing happens with washes- the bra pads will either come out all the way, or both pads will end up in one of the cups through mysterious forces. Maybe it has something to do with the centrifugal force of the wash? Either way, these are good bras for the price, but do have a few issues with wear that prevent me from giving 5 stars."
4.0,I would say for thye price very nice.
4.0,Dress looks like advertised except length. Much shorter than shown in picture.
4.0,I took a chance and I didn't regreted it... Look so expensive on my foot
4.0,Soft and smooth
4.0,"Cute suit, the halter style hurt my neck so I returned it."
4.0,Adorable dress love it.
4.0,"I like the shirt overall but the slit in the arms to not spread like in the picture and 1 sleeve slit already ripped, so i had to choose to sew it back or separate both sides"
4.0,Sexy suit! I'm 5'5&#34; 132lbs 32D and got a medium. Fits well. Lots of side boob and bottoms are cheeky when you move around but the fabric is thick and everything stayed covered even after I danced around a bit. Excited to wear the suit on vacation! Arrived 5 days after purchasing
4.0,The poofy skirt is so cute but a bit different color than the bodice (we have the pink one). But other than that it's a nice material and my daughter loves it.
4.0,Great dress for the price. Short folks beware the dress is very long. I'm 5'4&#34; and I ordered a small and I can't wear it with flats or it drags on the ground. It's very flattering and a great dress for the price but it's very long in the back which i didn't expect.
4.0,"This sweater fit well, but the material is thicker than i usually prefer.  It‚Äôs good for colder days and the shape is nice though!<br /><br />Generous sizing."
4.0,I think it is very cute but I don‚Äôt care for how it cling to my bottom. It really shows off how the bathin suit slightly cuts into my bottom.  I haven‚Äôt actually worn it yet as a cover up. The fabric does feel nice.
4.0,Dry quick!  Stay up nice.  Not real comfortable against the skin.
4.0,Super cute dress for a great price!!
4.0,36C 160lbs. Ordered XL. Really like the look of this swim suit.  It says crochet but really its nylon with a pattern cut in it.  Still fine. A little saggy in the bottom for me.  Top fits fine. Not overly snug anywhere.  The ties are a detachable.  Overall very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"wrinkles pretty easily, but it's perfect for covering my butt when I'm wearing leggings and a sweater.  it does not go high low, it's a straight line around."
4.0,Great quality for casual use but don‚Äôt try to workout in it you‚Äôll suffocate lol
4.0,Swim suit is look good but top one was little tight not really but is ok
4.0,So cute little lace edge showing keeps shoes from rubbing
4.0,Very pretty but not what I need for my event. Sorry the picture is sideways.
4.0,Cute love it just wish the skirt was a little more puffy
4.0,No complaints from who I bought them for.
4.0,I would definitely recommend sizing up And if you are tall be prepared for very short sleeved robe In the high water pants.  I absolutely love the material is so soft and very beautiful it looks even better and person but  Wish the sizes weremore inclusive
4.0,"Honestly the most perfect bag I‚Äôve ever seen, looks just like the photos. It said in the description that it comes with a matching card wallet but mine didn‚Äôt come with that, I don‚Äôt mind too much tho because the bag is soooo cute!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a little smaller but still fits ok. I was hoping it would be a darker navy green as it looks in the pic. But it‚Äôs comfortable! And I can wear it to work!
4.0,It is a little bigger than the original but it  still works perfectly fine
4.0,"It's always in a pocked of my purses as I hate putting my bag on the floor or bunching it up beside me. I had a more expensive on that was given to me as a gift, but it broke in about two weeks this one has been working beautifully for a couple months now without issue. It's lovely and works great!"
4.0,"This is by no means a cheaply made hoodie. It's comfortable yet heavy and well made giving a nice heft and warmth which was a great surprise. It does run a bit too big though, so do order in your regular size or slightly smaller if possible. As a 6'2"" man at around 220lbs, I went with the XL, and I found it to be far too baggy overall. That being said, it is great quality and is very well made, so I have no regrets as it is a perfect solution for a chilly winter day where I don't mind being swallowed up a bit more by the extra material!"
4.0,Great sweater! Was a terrific deal for the quality of sweater
4.0,A bit see through and longer than expected
4.0,This is the cutest little sun hat. It‚Äôs perfect at keeping the sun out of your baby‚Äôs face and making them look super duper cute at the same time. After two uses the top stem part eventually broke off which sucks but it‚Äôs still really cute and I will still be using it!
4.0,"Skirt runs a little small, granddaughter didn't like it because it rides up when walking"
4.0,Fits great and true to size and looks fantastic while driving or riding my bike.
4.0,I went up a size like the other reviewers suggested and it was good. The cut of this Tunic is so cute and flattering. Just because mindful of the sizing issue.
4.0,These are perfect when you‚Äôre in a hurry. Just slip your shoes on and go!
4.0,Almost like the real thing! Real stones- not plastic.
4.0,Thus far this wallet is cool. It hold your cards together pretty tight although I still carry an additional wallet for the extra cards that I have. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.
4.0,Very nice and pretty.
4.0,Little tight in waist.
4.0,"Pieces not to small , nice variety and quantity."
4.0,perfect for the beach. Very sexy. Wash with hand and air dry
4.0,I want to give them 5 stars because the quality is very nice. But they do run small around the waist.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Customer Service was great. Handled my issue very quickly
4.0,"The shirt fit perfect, the design was nice, but it looked like the print wasn‚Äôt completely dry before it got folded up and the clover was smudged."
4.0,"This leather bracelet is beautifully designed and is made with quality material. I really like the stainless steel locking clasp that doesn't take away from the beauty of the bracelet. My husband and I have been fighting over this bracelet because we both love it, although of I wear it, I'll need to trim some of the leather to fit my small wrist, but it still looks great. The reason that I gave it four stars is because one of the orange strings came loose around the clasp yesterday and the other side is barely holding on. I am going to try and take the clasp off and fix it myself-I will post an update on how this works out.<br />Other than that, I think that the bracelet is very beautiful and stylish for both men and women. I have already gotten many compliments from many different people. It looks as though it costs alot more than it does.<br />I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,These fit perfectly and I love them! Only 1 downfall is how see through they are...
4.0,This bag is very small and thin. I purchased as part of a birthday gift and my daughter says she likes it. I honestly can see this item being returned before the 30 day mark. It's so small and a little impractical. You can carry a phone and thin walllaeg comfortably. Anything else would really bee too much.
4.0,"fits well over glasses, good on sun, snow glare"
4.0,Very nice just be aware that it only comes with 1 earring. Either way this product is good quality. Will be purchasing another to complete the pair.
4.0,Perfect for office and easy on and off. Obviously cheap and great to use but get a heel protestant since there is zero padding.
4.0,"These slippers are very attractive. They keep your feet warm. They are soft and plush. It's like walking on a soft pillow. These slippers do run small, so I would definitely order a size up as they are not available in 1/2 sizes. These slippers did seem narrow at first but they stretched out just enough. I would definitely get another pair just larger."
4.0,I really like the charm that hangs at the end of the necklace I wish it would have been a little bit larger and a little bit heavier construction and the swimmer had stood out a little more but for the price it was a very nice necklace. I would have been willing to pay more for something that was a little heavier and the swimmer was more prominent
4.0,Serves purpose‚ÄîGlad to have it when in close contact with others. Wear with mask for double layer of protection!
4.0,"Nicer enough, but smaller than described"
4.0,My friend received a lot of compliments even from males. Great quality and price
4.0,I ordered a medium and should have ordered a small.
4.0,I loved the dress! Though I suggest you wear a slip underneath as it is a bit see through.
4.0,I was concerned that they only came in full sizes and I usually wear 7 1/2 but I have another pair of Dingo boots in size 7 which wear well.
4.0,the look is great has a great feel in material the case not in love with but i see the use behind it the frame has hinge to flex outward to fit any size of face the one knock i would have of this system is that if makes your ears stick out a little or for me at least but other then that great product give a thumb up to this
4.0,Great quality. Came with earrings too. Only complaint I have is that the ivory isn‚Äôt the color pictures. It‚Äôs more of like a clear color with a white tint.
4.0,Very fast shipping. Love the color!
4.0,I love the colors and the fabic is lightweight .I am looking forward to Summer wearing it alot .
4.0,"Good quality sandel, just what my husband wanted, the size wasnt correct for him so I ordered a larger size and gave these to our nephew.  He loves them too."
4.0,Beautiful fit perfect.
4.0,Fit fine. Wore well at beach
4.0,great looking well built watch.nice heavy feel .it's a steal  for the price. I would tell my friends to buy this handsome time piece.
4.0,"I already have the boots, I don‚Äôt know why action is required."
4.0,My wife loved it butterfly necklace.Butterfly smaller than it looks. But great quality
4.0,"Wear with high heels or get it tailored because it runs super long (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and the Large drags 2‚Äù on the floor). Also slightly see through, so be careful! It‚Äôs definitely cheaply made, BUT it‚Äôs soft, stretchy and a flattering cut.<br />Plus, I LOVE the ruched sides, perfect for curvy hips. And the ombr√© coloring is super cool."
4.0,When washed snaps did not lie flat. Left puckering on snap seam.
4.0,She hasn't had to use it yet but it will cover her almost entirely from the rain pretty excited to see the outcome it's super cute.but would most likely RIP if it got caught on anything.
4.0,I thought it was odd that my earrings didn't come with any backs but other than that I really like this product.
4.0,Very nice but the magnets squeeze your ear lobes a little bit.
4.0,I couldn‚Äôt give it 5 stars because the bow fell off on day 2. I had hell trying to glue it back on. But they are very flashy and cute
4.0,Probably my favorite carry belt
4.0,"I almost paid twice as much for this bag on another site. I love this cute, roomy bag. It holds everything I need, wallet, phone, tablet, book, etc.<br />The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the zipper. It does not zip end to end. it is centered between the handles and only zips up the center of the bag. I strong centered snap would be much better. The bag is deep enough, so nothing falls out."
4.0,"There was no case with it, but the I like the Sun Reader a lot.  I will order another for backup."
4.0,Very cute shirt. I had several compliments on the flamingos
4.0,The pearl is stunning. I am forced to return it as the chain is twisted in knots. I‚Äôm unable to wear it.
4.0,"Beautiful colors!  Material is cool and comfortable. 2x fit is as expected, I am 5'4&#34;, 240lbs."
4.0,"The best way to describe this shirt is very comfortable, but not form fitting.  I have an athletic build and this fits me nicely in the arms and shoulders, but hangs off my sides and chest.  I still like it though and gave it 4 stars because even though it doesn't fit great, it is very comfortable to wear. Recommendation, but error on a smaller size if you are athletic."
4.0,"Its a good protector, I've tried many screen protectors so I know what's good and bad."
4.0,"Love this dress. Got it in black for work. I am 5'8 and 160lbs, and it fit perfectly! It's slightly stretchy, which is great as it makes it more comfortable and easy to move in. It hits just below the knee and is very modest. It came with a little black belt with an ugly gold clasp - I'll ditch the clasp and wear it with the belt knotted, or wear other belts to brighten it up for summer. The sleeves are more like t-shirts sleeves than in the photo. All in all I'm very happy - it was a great deal, too!"
4.0,"Runs small, ladies!"
4.0,"The slippers fit fine, i wear 9.5 and i ordered 10. They are very light. Perfect for indoor on wooden (cold) floor. If your feet is sweaty (like mine), it is ideal indoor slipper. But i think it is too pricey."
4.0,"This is one our first s-zone item that we have purchased. This is the 3rd item we have from s-zone and can not recommend it enough. We received this from the seller as a replacement for a different product that was no longer offered. The original bag had a defect where the strap stream was not fully sewn. The seller responded within just a few days with a replacement.<br /><br />I honestly can not recommend them enough. With superior products, even defects happen sometimes and they are resolved quickly and efficiently. The leather is incredible quality‚Äîdurable and wears incredibly well (known from previous products). It is not excessively expensive and holds well. I love the style-with secure buckles & laptop compartment as well as secured places for pens. I don‚Äôt see an downsides to an incredible product.<br /><br />Update: after a few uses, I‚Äôve noticed that the buckles are a bit loose and sometimes fall off. Since they are nonfunctional decor for the snap closures, I hope they can improve this in the future!"
4.0,Love the fit and the little finger holes. My toddler feels like he can put his big boy underwear on by himself. These are super comfy material and so cute.
4.0,The band looks great! The only issue I have with it is that at times I had difficulty fitting it to the Fitbit frame multiple times. But overall it looks great.
4.0,"Would give it a five, I tried to find made in the USA but these were made in China and you should hand wash them.  I just used a laundry bag."
4.0,Good quality.  Zippers are very tight
4.0,These are super cute. I ordered the 10/12 but they were too small so i ordered but to 14/16. Might be too short for a taller girl...
4.0,This wristband was just right for my wrist it seems like it‚Äôs going to last a long time.
4.0,"I normally do not like traditional turtlenecks - they are either too bulky in the neck, too tight around the neck or emphasize my large chest too much but I took a gamble on this turtleneck and glad I did.  It's larger across the chest and the zipper detail seems to draw your eye upward.  It's very warm and color is as expected."
4.0,Nice comfortable compression wife beater. Has tendency to ride up while working out.  Gets soaked and dries slower than advertised. But great after wash and superior quality.
4.0,"Actually better than I expected.  The only complaint is the emblem on the legs of the glasses:  they are not glued down properly and snag my hair whenever I put them on or take them off.  The lenses are clear and the mirror reflects major glare.  All in all, an acceptable 'cheap' sunglasses for someone who is always losing or breaking them.  Will order more in variety of colors."
4.0,Gorgeous watch.. very slick
4.0,This is a great bag.  The only downside is that it isn't quite large enough for my husband.  He is using it for his business trips and he still has to take a small bag to take his shoes.
4.0,"I usually wear an 8 and ordered 10 which fits pretty well so I'd say it fits a little small.<br /><br />Seems like high quality material though I have not worn it swimming.<br /><br />I'm a UK 32G (40-30-40)  and it does not give any support but does give decent shaping to the girls. I do not think there is tummy control but the ruching camouflages a little. I found it dug in along the butt but this style always does that on me.<br /><br />If you're a more standard bra band size, and most any cup size I'd really recommend this suit. It's really pretty and had nice shaping features."
4.0,"Super cute house flip flops. I ordered size  9-10 and they're a little small, but not enough to be annoying."
4.0,"I got this on a whim experiment, not knowing quite what I would end up with.  It's pretty nice -- the material feels like a polyester and it's not thick, so it feels &#34;stable&#34; (as I imagine sweaters like this can get unruly pretty fast!).  I like how it fits over my body.  The neckline is slightly bigger that how I imagined it would, which can be fun because you can have it be a little showy either in the front or if you wanted to show a little shoulder -- or just gather the extra material to fall a little more over the back if you don't want that.  You have a lot of flexibility on how far down on your hips or legs you want this to go and still fit well, which I really like.  I've only worn it once and haven't washed it yet, but so far I really like that it's cozy but nice looking."
4.0,It's pretty small and doesn't have a lot of support. But I guess it's cute with tops with open backs and such?
4.0,"Fits well, comfortable. Rugged material, yet not harsh on the skin"
4.0,"Great medium sized bag. I have tons of tiny bags and huge bags so this is perfect. I attached a big gray pom onto it and it looks even better.<br /><br />Only thing is that the ends of the zipper, where the long shoulder strap clips in, doesn't stay down. It's locked by a push button but if you carry the bag with the shoulder strap then the buttons will snap open."
4.0,"Well made garment.  I am round shouldered now, and the back darts caused it to puff over my back.  It would look very nice on a straight back."
4.0,"Decent quality, affordably priced Chiffon crepe shirts.<br />You can wear these at work or in casual settings. I liked it so much I bought more in different colors.<br />Just be wary of perfume/deo/sanitizer stains on these shirts."
4.0,"Very nice dress, made very well, but the bust area runs large."
4.0,Good band . Better than most
4.0,My friend and I both love these earrings. They were just what we were looking for. I would recommend them. Thanks
4.0,"The waist area is smaller than I expected, however, I am an &#34;apple&#34; shape. The material is excellent, it's stretchy and great quality. I got the black, which is black but not a jet black, more of a dusty black. You could wear it on either side, seams exposed as shown, or the other side. I really love it, I only gave it 4 stars because the waist area is smaller than most maxi dresses, however, it does say &#34;slim&#34; in the description. If you have the &#34;pear&#34; shape, and are 5'5 or taller this is your signature dress, get it in every color!! Straight will love this dress to, the smaller waist will give you curves you may not have. Apples, we only really need one in our collection, pair it with a blazer to off set the tighter waist. I am sized 22 and the 3x works fine, the waist may be tighter than normal, but again I am a true apple shape.<br /><br />Update: I loved it so much, even with the smaller waist, I was going to get another one in a different color, I was sad to see the price increased, so I won't get a second one."
4.0,"The length is OK & the fit was OK, but The rise is very low compared to, like, Vision taekwondo pants."
4.0,Nice summer earrings!
4.0,Love this bag!  It is larger than I expected  which actually works for me because I love bigger bags. The strap is adjustable and can be made pretty long which is another plus if you want to wear it as a cross body bag it also has one inside zippered pocket . Would have given.it 5 stars if it had an addition zipper pocket in the back side of purse other than that I  am pleased with this purchase.
4.0,"These look good, are wider to collect the sweat well, and I have spares if they stretch out like most do after enough use."
4.0,"I bought this set for my husband,and he was very happy with it!The case they come in is cute,i just wish there was a little more of something there to protect the discs.It makes a nice gift,of a great collection of movies."
4.0,Fit fine. Just adjusted length.
4.0,"Sassy, unique dress, especially for the money. The material and stitching appear to be quality. The length is perfect. The sleeves are a bit cumbersome, but for a night on the town, I can make due. The top is stretchy and accommodates my 32k chest; however, the empire cut and &#34;one size&#34; design does make for a bit of a frumpy look. Because the dress is dark and pattern is bold, I think it works. Below is size 6 might swim in this dress, though."
4.0,fun colors.  not as great compression as other socks I have purchased.
4.0,"For those looking for a protective face covering during the pandemic, this gaiter offers a single layer of protection and fits snugly around the face, and it is just not suited for that purpose. The main quality to consider with this gaiter is that is as long as a man's forearm and hand together, so it has plenty of length to take on the various configurations one puts a gaiter through. It suits my primary use, to avoid dust and pollen while I do yard work. It is cool and comfortable. It comes with a small, reusable ziplock bag for storage. Recommended."
4.0,"Read reviews that it runs small and it does. Got large and fitted the way my medium sweaters fit me. So definitely order 1size up (or 2 sizes bigger if want to be comfortable). Is a heavy material, heavier then I wanted. So beware of that. Length runs shorter then I like."
4.0,Nice quality. Would like less survivor bands as we bought them to support one survivor so we had to flip some around.
4.0,"This is cute.  The chain is short but not choker short and has a crab claw style clasp.  I didn't get tarnish marks from wearing.  The pendent portion is good size and very eye catching.  Overall, its cute and for me a fun/whimsical nod to the holiday's / winter."
4.0,"These took forever to arrive, but I‚Äôm really looking forward to wearing them with the right top. The color is quite rich, and the material is soft but thick. I think they‚Äôll be good for fall and winter. They fit true to size for me. I‚Äôm tall (5‚Äô8.5‚Äù) and slim, and I find them fairly flattering. I can wrap the belt all the way around the front and back and tie in a little knot, which I think looks better than a bigger bow with exposed elastic at the back. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend for a fashion forward jogger sweatpant you could wear to work."
4.0,The chess board is great but there are no pieces that come with it. (My fault for not double checking)
4.0,Perfect fit gloves. The website shows accurate dimension sizes. They do smell a bit but as expected for items packed for long time. Leave them out for a while and it is all good.
4.0,"My husband had this item on his wish list and I purchased it as a Christmas gift knowing it would arrive near the end of January.  It was as described and perfect for his cell phone.  However he thought it was a full size man's handbag, not just for the cell phone, he had not read the measurements correctly and so was disappointed.  But otherwise, the product was as described and did arrive before January 31 and was packaged well."
4.0,"Great for a cocktail party. Stretchy material lends itself to comfort and fit but just misses on the $$ looks expensive factor. The best part though, I felt pretty wearing it. 5'4 165 lbs the XL was perfect. I will likely order another. It will catch on sharp edges and pull the material. I ruined it with a bracelet."
4.0,"Product does not have much stretch but still fit, is thick quality material, and super cute!!!"
4.0,as expected but also came with case and cleaning cloth was nice..
4.0,"Top was cute, just like the picture provided. I normally wear  Medium and ordered a Small. The sixe in terms of the overall shirt were perfect. With the larger sizes the material looks more like a parachute than a shirt. My only issue was that the arm holes were too small and cut into my armpits. I returned it since the Medium is too big in the overall shirt."
4.0,"4 stars because the product arrived to my address 18 days later than expected (maybe due to new year holidays idk) anyway it fits, it is breathable and you can see good through the mask depending on outside light condition."
4.0,"Great, quality. Almost fits too much stuff, but I'll carry it everywhere."
4.0,"This top is super pretty, nice material for the price too but it was kinda big... I normally wear a small but i could have used an extra small in this."
4.0,I should‚Äôve got a size smaller.
4.0,"Great stone quality, good shipping. Only problem I had was the size! I ordered 00 and received 0, easy thing to correct. Just not completely reliable."
4.0,nice scarf ring.
4.0,"I love the dress but it's somewhat big, about 2 inches big, but the sleeves are perfect for me. The fabric is really thick too, it's very nice."
4.0,"I don‚Äôt remember reading that this had stretch to it in the description when I bought it, but it does. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about that when it arrived, but when I put it to the test on a 5 day trek in Peru, I was satisfied with the performance. I‚Äôm in the fence about the buckle, looks a little classier than the standard belt buckle like this, but i was a little concerned that it could detach from belt a little more easily than the standard. It did not fail me on this trip and in the end, I decided I liked the bit of stretch in the belt"
4.0,I have not traveled with this luggage yet so can only say it is as described. It is light weight and the rollers seem to spin well .  It would be an easy size for overhead compartment on airplane. I like the hard case.
4.0,"Super cute dress, but didn‚Äôt fit me quite right. Definitely size down one. Love that it has pockets."
4.0,I just got this today so I can't really speak of how well it holds up but I love it. It seems well put together and does have a lot of space. I'm guessing if you use it like a purse it won't last. I think this is more meant for light travel. Also it was $20 if you want something that's going to last forever buy a purse
4.0,The dress is very cute. The colors are nice. The dress was really big on my daughter.  I ordered her current size but maybe should have sized down.
4.0,Good quality overall. Nice fit.
4.0,"This blouse was way too small. I'm usually a medium in shirts and I ordered a xxl because I saw other people saying it runs really small. With three sizes up I thought I'd be safe for sure, but it wouldn't button. I'm only giving it a 4/5 because the seller was so helpful."
4.0,I wear this frequently and receive many compliments.  It really accentuates my tiny waist.  It is perfect with a corset.
4.0,The color of the mask plastic was much brighter green then advertised but it isn't an issue.  The mask works just fine and lights up very nicely
4.0,Very nice it did the job
4.0,They were the right size and right color.
4.0,The slip flops fit good its the strap between my toes that hurts my foot because the leather is too thick between the toes.This is my third purchase of coach flip flops. I hope this helps other customer.
4.0,"I bought this tankini/bikini because I had purchased one prior similar in its style and I loved it. Unfortunately this swimsuit is not for me. The material is real thin and silky,I bought an extra large to insure it was not too tight because I have a larger bottom and large top. The bottoms are tighter then I like. With the kind of material it's made with I feel you could see through it after getting wet. It comes with padding on the top which is fine for most , for me I have to cut it out. The entire suit isn't made too well with miss stitches, and crooked seams. The idea behind this suit is really cute and fun. You can wear it without the tank top . Then it's a bikini top with a shorts bottom. I like the fact it has three straps on each side of the bikini top. I Honestly feel the material and lack of care sewing is the miss with this suit .<br />I received this item at a discount or free for my honest and unbiased opinion and review."
4.0,Unless you are tall you will have to get them hemmed. But they are great!
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little short, but really cute. The material is more tee shirt than sweat shirt. The red plaid on the sleeves is so cute."
4.0,Jacket is fit as expected but inside of the  right hand the stitch was open or not stitched
4.0,a little too tight in the beginning but just what I needed
4.0,"It was for my boyfriend originally, but I found out it find my oval shaped face better than his heart shaped face. I still love it regardless. My boyfriend looks good with it on still even though the fit is a little bit awkward, with a little eyemake up to fit the theme of the mask it is pulled off quite well."
4.0,Nice everyday bag.
4.0,"The reason I bought this coat on here was that it was sold out on the GUESS web site. It is small across the back but I am losing weight  -- the reason that I am returning it, Listed in the Women's section of the GUESS web site ....not the child's section to my knowledge."
4.0,Nice quality suit but ran a little big.
4.0,"Reinforced heel and toe, ribbing for arch support.  The material is durable with a tight stretch.  The socks are very shaped and don't fit well on a smaller foot or a very narrow foot.  I'd say these won't work well for most women, and ideally men's feet should be size 9 and up to fit well in boots without bulk in the toes."
4.0,ü•≤üëç
4.0,"great watch band I would definitely buy again.  However, after I ordered it the price went down! that's the only downside..Other than than I highly recommend this if you need a new band for your watch."
4.0,"Excellent as loungewear in warm climate or for someone who overheats. It‚Äôs a bit lightweight for me,  But its winter and in summer probably will be great. I bought in a few colors and loved them all and I am pleased.<br /><br />They DO coordinate with other Leiv items well.<br /><br />Looks packable, easy to pair with many outfits, roomy and comfortable, nice silky feel.<br /><br />It IS a bit thin and a bit long on me, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù. So that‚Äôs why 4* not 5*. Inexpensive material, but that‚Äôs what I expected.<br /><br />Nice for the price.<br /><br />A bargain for the price though (around $9.99 atm)."
4.0,"Very cute French bulldog print.  The scarf was soft, too.  A great gift for and Frenchie lover."
4.0,Cute top. Material is a little on the cheaper side. I ordered a large since I am pregnant but would normally fit a medium.
4.0,Band is shorter than I expected very tight fit was already at Max micro adjustments looks nice though
4.0,Can't wait to pair this with a outfit. These are a lot larger then I normally wear but I am up for the challenge. There's nothing like building a outfit around a item. Lots of fun. Priced just right.
4.0,This product runs small. I am a true medium and the large is a tad snug. Still an overall good jacket. If you want a snug fit - 1 size up. Want a &#34;comfortable&#34; fit - 2 sizes up.
4.0,This dress is almost perfect - just a bit too long.  I bought a small and am 5 foot 6 inches and I have to wear heels in order for it not to drag on the ground. Very soft and the rest fits beautifully though.
4.0,"I love the tank but I ordered a LG, should have gotten and XL.  I'm working on fitting into though!"
4.0,"The size was spot on, so it fit well. It‚Äôs thicker and heavier  than my other rings, which takes some getting use to."
4.0,"I am attending a local ""nerd night"" event in a few weeks and wanted a new cosplay for my rotation. Jessica Rabbit costumes are usually hideous, poorly made, and expensive. I chose this dress because it had good reviews. I initially was going to order an extra large but decided to go down a size after reading how stretchy it is. I was VERY nervous about this as I am a 34DDD, 30"" waist, and 48"" hips. When I took it out of the box my immediate reaction was ""there is no way this is going to fit!"" But the gamble paid off! It is VERY stretchy and hugged me in all the right places without becoming transparent. I love it. It does have a long train, which I knew going into ordering and don't mind. I feel like it gives it an extra touch of old Hollywood glamour. It has a small bit of boning to keep the V shape at the chest as well, which is a nice touch. My only complaint is that the lining on the bottom of the dress is not attached to the actual dress. it makes the lower half lay a little odd, but it's nothing I can't fix with a few quick stitches. Overall, very pleased with this gown."
4.0,"I've ordered this shirt two times. The first time I order it in gray in my size. It was perfect. I am wearing multiple days a week. The fabric of the shirt is not too thick hit also not thin and too stretchy. Regarding length, it was great. The &#34;low&#34; part of this high low shirt sits a little above the hips and covered my big belly. On the other side it covers the tush. The sleeve were neither loose or tight. It was a great comfortable everyday t shirt. I've even slept in it and it did not pill or stretch out. HOWEVER when I ordered it the second time in black, I received something that looked like it was hastily put together. The fabric felt like a second thought: it is so thin, stretchy and cheap feeling. It clings to the body and not in a good way. Be careful. Fifty fifty chance. And it can either be a great shirt for you or a waste of time and money."
4.0,Exactly what I wanted in a Hat. The quality of the speakers are excellent and they get loud enough for outdoor listening. They only reason I knocked off a star was that my hat arrived and the adhesive for the right speaker was not applied properly and the speaker was dislodged from the velcro unit. I used Gorilla Glue and fixed the problem easily but that is not something the customer should have to do.
4.0,They are a great price for three belts. They will not last for a long time
4.0,"I like these, but I wish they looked more like they do in the picture. Or I was sent the wrong color. Mine had a metal strip across the top and have a tortoise look to them, but not at all like the picture."
4.0,pretty suit.  top was too small
4.0,"I got the wrong color shirt (expected blue, but received grey), but I still like it. The material is really soft and the fit flatters my shape well."
4.0,"I liked it. I just wish it didnt come out wrinkled. I have to get it dry cleaned. I put it in the dryer, but that didn't take out the wrinkles."
4.0,To small from the legs
4.0,"Size was true to the chart. Great fit! I was skeptical in ordering my proper size based on the reviews, but I figured returns would be simple if it didn't fit well. The material is thick, but not denim thick, and there are no pinch points. I'm very pleased with the quality and fit, and I love the wine color!"
4.0,Based on other reviews I ordered a size up (M) than what I usually do. Im 5'3 and weigh 130 lbs. Love the tops but since I ordered a size up its a little loose at the top. Since it's for the gym doesn't matter much but prob won't wear it out like I initially intended.
4.0,"I only wanted the scraf, but it's too hot to keep on over nite. The bag is of good fabric, the brush and tape measure were a bonus."
4.0,Hat works fine except the internal sweatband is not up to the task.  I use the hat with my regular sweatbands so it is not a problem.
4.0,Cute and flattering. This is the only color that worked out. Dark/Light grey. The others are UGLY!<br />I wear a M and ordered a M.
4.0,The chain is plastic feeling and cheap looking.. not what I expected from this brand.
4.0,Fits perfectly with a lot of sparkles.
4.0,"Protected the face of the watch, but scratches very easily. Not the best for touch screen, hard to use some apps through the thicker plastic."
4.0,"The only disappointment is that the lining is not attached to the bottom or sides so it slides around making putting things in and taking them out difficult at times.  Other wise I love this bag!  If it's not real leather it sure looks and feels like real leather!  It is heavy.  I was shocked at how heavy it was when it was empty out of the box.  It has lots of room and that's why I bought it.  I use it for my clinical for my master's program and don't have to bring more than one bag with it.  Most of what I need to take with me fits in there along with my other items.  One suggestion if you buy this bag is to use some sort of organizer with it.  It has pockets but I find it much easier to find things by using small pouch bags inside the purse.  I have one bag for things like pills, another for pens, work badges, and other small items, doing this keeps me from searching through the bag for small things.  It's a huge bag inside but doesn't look enormous when you're carrying it, but you can &#34;lose&#34; small items in it because of the slippery lining.  Have had lots of compliments on this bag.  My daughter wants it!  She can't have it!"
4.0,"I like the tight fit (bought a small). It has hooks along the bottom 2-3"" to get you started. Once those are hooked, it is easy to pull up the zipper. I find the arms uncomfortable so far, but am getting used to them. It is not so tight that you are forced into an straight posture, but it is pretty tight. I don't feel like eating as much when I wear it!<br />(If you wear anything under it, that undergarment will be pressed very tightly into your skin. Bra's become uncomfortable by the end of the day.)"
4.0,"I really like this dress, it makes me look younger but it makes me look fun too! I am 5'5 and 145 lbs and it fits right.<br />The only problem I have with it is that one of the sleeves is weirdly sewn at the shoulder, but for the price, it is not that big of a deal"
4.0,"Looks original enough. I don't know if it truly is but it's pretty good quality. Looks legit. I guess, that's good enough for the price even if it's fake."
4.0,Fit as expected but very thin material. Love the pockets. Wish they had a little more compression and a drawstring waist band.
4.0,Need to try very hard to take cards out
4.0,"I really like this dress. It looks like the picture, no false advertising. My only issue is it's a bit small. I followed the sizing chart, but the dress is fairly tight(as it should be) and leaves nothing to the imagination. White bra/panties are a must with this dress. However then you get panty lines. Also, it rides up a bit. I honestly think my issues were only due to the sizing."
4.0,"Everything I wanted. Only taking off a star because it is slightly shorter than anticipated. When I raise my arms, it comes to just below my boobs. Very cute and lightweight."
4.0,"I would have given these 3 stars, but the lenses are very small! Great style, I just wish they were a bit larger for a guy's face."
4.0,"I have received tons of compliments on these! Very striking-looking shoe and totally fun for summer! The fit, though, is a bit tricky; I have small feet and ordered my normal size. The way the shoe appears to be designed, it looked as though my feet should have slipped right in. Not so! Had to work back and forth, several times on both shoes, before feet finally hit bottom of foot bed. Once in, the fit was fine except that foot bed is rock hard. No support and not padded. I added some cushioning and they also go on a bit easier after several wears."
4.0,Light weight top. Very nice. Cut small. Size 14 38D needs XL to fit and a 2x to glow.
4.0,Cute but not as long as I would like.  I'm 5'7&#34; but long legs - I ordered a size medium of the same brand in a different style and those were perfect.  Cute pants though!
4.0,provided good traction on floor.
4.0,"very cute, well made shoe. runs very big. am returning."
4.0,blocks out sun great but 'MIB' comments are daily so sometimes they are in my bag or pocket until the glare is really oppressive and making me feel 'blinded by the excessive sun-light=
4.0,too small for me but great product for wife and kids. draw string helps a bunch  I wish they would make a larger size
4.0,Believe the show will stretch and fit perfect with a little time.  Like the look and color of the shoe.
4.0,Too small even at xxl I‚Äôm a size 16
4.0,Ordered a large. It runs big.
4.0,Not the best of the best not the worst of the worst. I've had one of these since I was 18 years old I am 52 now there is a difference in all of them
4.0,"Material is quite thin...so make sure to wear your spanx!  Otherwise, it's a great skirt for the price!"
4.0,"The glasses were really lightweight, but has a yellow tint when using due to blue light protection"
4.0,It is see thru.. So beware.
4.0,"I loved my hat. I gave it a 4 out of 5 bc it was a little tight on my head, however I do have a large head."
4.0,Para hacer deportes
4.0,This didn‚Äôt fit my daughter right.<br />However it‚Äôs great quality !
4.0,"Really cute, seems to be good quality."
4.0,Slightly too small for my average sized 3 year old.
4.0,But would have like leather to be a bit softer and more flexible
4.0,"These earrings are really cute, just didn‚Äôt meet what I was looking for. I was trying to match them to my yellow gold leaf earrings that are also pictured but these earrings are a different shade of yellow. They were really easy to take on and off and they fit my cartilage piercing perfectly."
4.0,Super cute light weight thought it would be thicker thank god it wasn‚Äôt!
4.0,"Super comfy! I will definitely be wearing this on long plane rides! The pants were a little shorter than I expected. I am 5'7 and bought a small since I always buy a small in their clothes, but I think that's the way they are supposed to fit? I will be buying the other colors as well!"
4.0,Size is perfect. Felt small initially but it expands to fit your foot. Happy with the product.
4.0,Jackets amazing but the zipper is kinda cheap and gets stuck alot.
4.0,Made it through one trip without a problem.
4.0,Gave as a gift to lifer Marine and he said it keeps him nice and warm. 98 years old and he can still wear his dress uniform!
4.0,"I don't usually wear earmuffs but these are warm and cute. I like the way they fit and they look. They are soft and warm. Other reviewers have pointed out that the earmuff doesn't flex, but I still find the fit comfortable."
4.0,"Great pair to match the pumpkin costume I bought for my daugther.  Don't know what else she would wear them with, but served their  purpose."
4.0,"Purchased as I work in the Operating Room all day on my feet.<br />They dont have as much support as others I've purchased from Nurse Mates website , but still cute."
4.0,"I gets lots of comments on these. My only issue is the clip itself is a bit bulky. Vintage clips I own sit much flatter. Theee are obviously made in bulk. Overall, totally worth the price."
4.0,"Would have given higher. Dress is beautiful, and as described. Material is nice with a hard to find a lining these days for a smooth look. Color is a true but the size runs large, and  I will have  to exchange. I recommend this dress just be cautious about sizing."
4.0,Fabric is thin. Wears nice though.
4.0,Not the most amazing sweatpants.. but they are cheap and they work. Comfy enough and keep you warm without being too hot. Second time buying these because you can‚Äôt beat the value.
4.0,"I asked for this dress for an important event, it's like looking at the image let me guide by some opinions and ask for a bigger size, so it was a real mistake that I could not use it that day, I had to adjust it. I definitely recommend it, just ask for it in the size you really are"
4.0,It's pretty but the color isn't as bright when you get it.  The day I got it I put it on and haven't taken it off.  I really love it!
4.0,"Nice piece of jewelry,  but it barley fits my ankle."
4.0,"Nice frames but a little specific in fit. The glasses don't actually rest on the nose bridge unless you have a very prominent upper nose, they just sort of float."
4.0,I think the necklace is beautiful but the clasp doesn't allow you to shorten the necklace thus I used the pendant and bought another necklace at my desired length
4.0,"Is looks good, I'm happy with my."
4.0,"I love my travel billfold with two exceptions.  One is my fault---I ordered the periwinkle and I'm too sloppy!  Should have ordered black!  The only other ""down side"" is that there is no coin-purse type pocket on the outside.  (There is one on the inside, but you have to unzip to get to it.)Other than that---I love it and I've owned several."
4.0,The hat was perfect the only problem was the ship time
4.0,"I am 5'9&#34; and 140 lbs. I usually wear M, so I ordered a L (because of all the comments about it fitting small. It is too big! I should have just ordered the M. The product looks just like expected, but it was too big for me. I am going to try altering it to fit. On a better note, the delivery was very fast (less than one week), and when I talked to the seller about the product being too big, they replied very quickly and courteously. If you are NOT ordering an XXL or XL, you might do better to buy the actual size you need, not a size larger."
4.0,"It's not exactly 'soft cotton' as advertised - feels more like thin canvas since it's cotton and linen but it's very well made, comfortable and durable. The colors are drab and could be better"
4.0,It‚Äôs super comfy and cute.. just runs too big and is really thick so it makes you look thicker rather than slimmer. I‚Äôd buy it a size smaller maybe even two sizes smaller. I‚Äôm usually a large or medium depending on the fit. I got a medium but for most jackets I get a large because I have bigger shoulders and I‚Äôm longer so I need the length but I feel the small would fit just right.
4.0,Looks so advertised a little bit  loose
4.0,"Great fitting suspenders that I use for work, strong as the fireman style.<br />One pair came with two clips reversed buy that really didn't bother me.<br />Overall the quality is very good, much better than I had anticipated.<br />Worst part was waiting many weeks for them to arrive from China. I guess they are made to order then shipped out by cargo ship so if you need them fast, you might need to get them from someone else."
4.0,First things this ships from China so expect to wait about 2 week for it to arive if you live in the states. Second these reviews made me very nervous about what size to get. I'm 5&#34;5 160 lbs I ordered the large and it fit amazing. Not skin tight at all. The shorts sort of give a camel toe. And the collor  does not fit as shown in the images. Other wise super soft and cute. I ordered in to colors green and purple.
4.0,Nice dress but runs very big.
4.0,They would be really cute for normal ear piercings but they‚Äôre kind of bulky for fake nose piercings or for cartilage piercings and they really hurt the typical helix area. Cute though if you don‚Äôt have your ears pierced!
4.0,Really happy with this. It is very well made and fits great. I like that it matches my tan shoes. The shade is just right. It is a synthetic material made to look like leather but it looks nice. No smell whatsoever. Hubby calls it my Zena belt lol!
4.0,"A little too large, but keeps my head warm."
4.0,Very nice thick (not too thick) hoodie zipup!!  Very pleased on the size and feel of it...!!
4.0,Live the color and all the compartments for all my cards and things.
4.0,Absolutely loved the necklace. Was nice that it came with the option of two chains.<br />Really loved the black corded one though. If there would have been two of those with the one being quite longer in length.<br />I would have given this a five. It's no doubt a beautiful piece.
4.0,My wife liked it. It was a lot smaller than I expected and the chain is not great but overall nice for the price.
4.0,Its a comfortable fit and cool design. Overall nice quality.
4.0,It is beautiful I love it. It is a bit thinner then I thought it would be but still a great shirt.
4.0,"The pajamas were cute for my son to wear on our recent Disney Cruise in which they have pirate night!  The material is a little thin, so if you live in a cold climate they may not keep your little one very warm.  It's fine for us because we live in a warm climate.  The fit was as expected, my son is on the small side so the bottoms were a little loose, but they appear to fit just like other clothing of the same size.  The pattern is only on the front of the shirt, the back is plain white.  The bottoms have the pattern all over."
4.0,"Very nice fitting dress.  There were a lot of threads left hanging that had to be trimmed, but didn‚Äôt affect the fit."
4.0,I ordered this actually for a party. I hate dresses but needed one so gambled on this one. Was pleased with the fit as I don't do clingy nor above the knee dresses. I did size up for that reason. It arrived and I can't say I am a dress convert but this one is very nice especially for the price.
4.0,"I purchased the white one in XXL and it was surprisingly comfortable and soft, and just the right length! However for bigger women it may not be the most flattering. That's my issue though not the makers and it is very see through but that's not a big deal when it's just to sleep in. I do plan on buying more though!!"
4.0,"Context: I'm 6'4"" tall at about 225lb. I have been unable to find shirts that fit for years. Either too-wide (X-Large) or too tight/short (Large). Years ago I had success with certain colors of Russel Athletic NuBlend shirts but they are no longer made.<br /><br />Purchased: Short-sleeve, Classic Fit, Long, Crew, and Medium-weight cotton fabric<br /><br />Fit: I think they nailed it. The length is great and the fit around the body is spot on too.<br /><br />Style: Not a huge fan of the overall style but I think this comes down to personal preference. I prefer heavier cotton shirts and a traditional crew neck line (usually 1""?). This shirt is lighter than I prefer, the neckline is really thin and unlike the crew-style I'm familiar with, and the sleeves are a tad bit shorter than I prefer. Overall, I'm going to wear it a bit to see if it grows on me. Happy with the quality though. It's also extremely soft!<br /><br />Give it a shot! The photo-taking for the 3d body double is easy. I was hoping to buy several more but will hold off until more options are available. I'm considering trying the long-sleeve shirt and will update this review if/when I do."
4.0,"I normally wear a size 10, Large shirt, have a large bust, and am 5'8&#34; - got size L for this dress and it was very snug on my chest, didn't blouse much, and fell right to my ankle. The vintage floral pattern was very pretty and the material was not see-through, but I did return it because it was too snug and not as flowy as I would have hoped. The pictures didn't show the elastic band in the back where a tie (attached to the dress) would cover if tied in the back, but it did seem a bit out of place."
4.0,"These did the job, but were a little smaller than I expected. If I had to get some again, I would want them to have a little more slack for when I want to wear my glasses around my neck."
4.0,"The shirt fits good, I just assumed it was a men‚Äôs type fit. More of a women‚Äôs cut."
4.0,"Size is true to shirt sizes. Since this is a jacket should be sized accordingly 1 size down Medium is Small, Large is Medium, Xl is Large and XXl is large and so on If applicable. One should order one size up"
4.0,"I love this boot, but it was tight. I wear a 9 1/2 M,<br />But these are cut smaller. A 10 M would be great.<br />That size was not available."
4.0,Fits great and is sexy. True to size<br /> I purchased 1x
4.0,"This item is literally what you get it for. It‚Äôs good for the look but, is also hard to breathe in and if your doing activities while wearing it, beware the imminent sweat that is going to be dripping down your face and you take it off. For the money it‚Äôs just alright. If you want a nice mask just get a full hard shell mask."
4.0,One size two small will order another one size larger
4.0,Muy lindos aunque peque√±os para adultos..
4.0,It fits as expected. My only complaint is that the collar of white seems more pronounced than the pictures - it‚Äôs wider than the white stripes.
4.0,"They are pretty, but they are clearly cheap. There is also an ugly smell to them. It smells like a lot of chemicals. Also, the strap heel lock comes off. I think it was intended for that. Overall beautiful. They also fit well. Got a lot of compliments"
4.0,if they have high cut style would be perfect for my need
4.0,Beautiful but a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Good for girls not for women
4.0,"Seems to be good quality and after a short break-in it‚Äôs very comfortable. The label is embroidered, which as an ant-tag person I do not prefer, but it sort of disappears in the patterns. A little rigid for breaking in. But the patterns are rad!"
4.0,"There have been a lot of mixed reviews on this so I thought I would share a photo of what I received and give a more in-depth review for those considering.<br />The Fabric:  In my opinion, the  dress is very close to the pic on Amazon.  The color looks the same to me. The pattern is a little different from the one the model is wearing, but it‚Äôs tie-dye and in my experience there is always going to be variation with tie-dye so you be the judge.<br />  The fabric is 95% polyester but dress has a cotton-y kind of feel and is flowy/not stiff  (the other 5% is spandex, I assume that represents the elastic at the back as there is no stretch to the dress).<br />The fit:  I have a larger chest, so it doesn‚Äôt hang exactly as it does on model as she appears to be very thin.  The top has adjustable strings so you can adjust how high or low you wear it.  There is also a small keyhole with drawstring at waist that you can also open or close.  The back is open so if you have a little back fat on the sides (like I do you) may want to adjust accordingly! As I mentioned, I have a larger chest so if I wear it lower I do get a little side boob action,  but again, the top has drawstrings so you can adjust to your body.  Of course, there is absolutely no structure or support to this style of dress and you cannot wear a bra -  so you either have to feel comfortable without  or need to get a sticky bra.  The sides of the skirt have slits.  I am 5‚Äô2 and have longer legs for my height and the slits go above my knees. The skirt does have the same shape as seen on the model (it sort of flares at the top and narrows as it goes down/it‚Äôs not cut straight up and down).<br /><br />The sizing: I am 5‚Äô2, 34 DD and generally a 6.  Ordered the 4/6 (the tag says Medium) and it fits as expected. The dress touches the floor when I am barefoot."
4.0,"Does the job. You might want to warn your customers that the packaging sports logos and/or writing that have to do with the police.<br />I had the item sent to my little sister who was an au pair in Pelham, New York. The family she was staying at found themselves the recipient of an unexpected delivery marked with police logos and freaked out thinking they'd been targeted by some drug related scam.<br />Other than that, great item"
4.0,It was comfy.
4.0,"This came in handy for the LSAT's, the downside is that it is useful only for the LSAT's.  I will be listing this one soon."
4.0,Ordered a small I LOVE IT
4.0,"The watch is a perfect for it's arthentacy, there's nothing wrong with this watch, I have plenty of watches and this particular watch fits well in my collection, there's not a lot to explain about the watch other than it's solid, don't ever get caught up on the watch has to be higher price to be good, this particular watch is good and I would recommend it for any one who appreciates good stylish watches."
4.0,"I was very happy to see the overall size and quality of this scarf.  Can be used as a wrap, coverup or long scarf."
4.0,Product fits as expected. It provided covering over my ears and the look I wanted.
4.0,"This Orchid Row Kimono Printed Chiffon Open Front cover-up is made of mid to lightweight chiffon fabric that moves effortlessly and drapes beautifully. The vibrantly colored pattern is very feminine and pretty.<br />The sizing is generous and would accommodate up to 3X plus sizes with ease. It feels oversized on my petite stature but I can make this work if I leave it untied. I've thought of trying it belted, but the sleeves are too wide for that. If they made this in a wrap style top I would be over the moon!<br /><br />I truly love this fabulous Kimono and will be getting a lot of enjoyment wearing it. It's a wonderful wardrobe piece that adds fun and flair to jeans and dressier attire."
4.0,Very comfortable and warm. I have not tested how waterproof they are but the boots look stylish. I wish they had more colors to choose from though.
4.0,Dress for nicely. I was impressed for the proce I paid how good it looked. I got a size small and I am 5'2 126lbs. I am wider on the hips so it was a little snug on that area but still think a small was the best option for me. Love the way it hugs at the waist and shapes it. Did not have to worry about wearing a shapernor anything.  Really good buy!
4.0,Love this. Its super comfy prefect for chilly weather. And I got it fast would recommend getting a size up
4.0,Beautiful suit!!  It does fit me somewhat small but over all will keep it because I like the suit.
4.0,"Gloves are thick, warm and comfortable. Only problem is they are not very touch screen sensitive. They work fine quickly checking apps but don‚Äôt work well for long term app use, like games or texting."
4.0,"Very cute shirt but is quite a bit shorter than pictured. Also more snug and thin than I expected. I'd recommend ordering a size up, though it's not necessary."
4.0,"card slots are a little tight and your larger cells just barely fit in here, but overall good product."
4.0,"These glasses were very nice, but much too big for my face.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
4.0,"Love this item, but unfortunately both the medium and large runs too little.üòûWill return and hope it come in xl or xxl. I normally wear med or size 8. Great look for evening out with jeans or cute skirt."
4.0,"I love the look of this dress, it‚Äôs really cute. I don‚Äôt like the bloomers on the bottom because my daughter has to take the whole dress off and untie it to go potty. I also wish it had sides because it seems to be more skin than fabric."
4.0,"The pants are very comfy and cute, but they are pretty sheer so I couldn‚Äôt wear them out of the house. They‚Äôre pjs only, but I do love them and would order more for pjs. I got them in the mint color and I‚Äôm not sure if other colors are as sheer as these are but you could see every pattern on my underwear."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù this covers my bum, which is what I wanted! It does require ironing. It came out of the package wrinkled. I washed it and hung it to dry and still had to iron it. Especially the lapels. They didn‚Äôt want to lay down. After ironing though it was exactly what I was looking for! Gave it four stars because it does require some extra care; but I don‚Äôt mind and I feel like for the price the extra effort is worth it."
4.0,They look nice. Good value.
4.0,"I bought this for my son, and he's a very active 11 year old, he loved them and he used them for school constantly! I would buy again cause he wrecks shoes like crazy"
4.0,"The bag can hold well, it's just that the zipper is a little fragile. Otherwise, holds up to like 10 lbs."
4.0,Thanks for the gift box included and these earrings are a gift to give this Christmas 2019!
4.0,"Nice build, works as I anticipated."
4.0,"This shirt is actually very flattering on me. I am about 5‚Äò5‚Äú, 180 pounds. I have size 38 double D boobs. A lot of things make me look fatter because my boobs are bigger and I have wide shoulders. This actually hugs me in all the right places and gives me shape. It‚Äôs not too tight on my shoulders. I‚Äôm knocking off a star because it is a ribbed type design and I don‚Äôt like that.  However, my friend at brunch was complementing the shirt, and said that she liked it because it was ribbed. I found that it picked up lint and dog hair very easily."
4.0,good little purse lots of pockets
4.0,They were cute and seem to be good quality for the price.
4.0,Great shirt! Was a little baggy but I love it
4.0,Was nice material and fit to size
4.0,"I like the shorter leg length, not as long as most capris.  I ordered a size up because I don't like to show every bulge I have and plan to wear them with tunics.  Fabric is not too sheer.  These will work well for me."
4.0,"Hoodie.... yes. Sweatshirt.... not even close.  Basically a long sleeve shirt with a hood. Material feels kinda weird,  so it's just an added layer."
4.0,"it fits really snug but it has stretch to it, I still like it"
4.0,"Since I purchased my Apple Watch I've been using the black stock rubber watch band that came with it almost exclusively. I did try the Apple Watch Band, Penom Fully Magnetic Closure Clasp Mesh Loop Milanese Stainless Steel Bracelet Strap for Apple iWatch Sport &amp; Edition 42mm - Black for about a week but ended up returning it because the magnet was not strong enough to hold the position on the strap, causing me to constantly have to readjust it. I loved the way that watch band looked but couldn't deal with adjusting it all day long.<br /><br />Since then I've continued to use the boring yet reliable stock rubber watch band until I came across this leather replacement. I've been using it now for almost 2 weeks and am very happy with it.<br /><br />Some users have reported that it feels uncomfortable and frays quickly. I have not experienced either of these problems, so I'm not sure if they received a defective item or are doing something different. My watch band still looks and feel perfect!<br /><br />I am very pleased with the magnetic strap on this watch band - it has multiple magnets placed along the end of it that do a great job securing the position you close it at. As I noted with the previous band I tried this was the major issue I had with that band.<br /><br />I do think this band looks very nice with my Apple Sport Watch as well. I've always liked leather watch bands over the rubber ones and feel it classes it up a notch!<br /><br />Installation was super easy thanks to Apple's great replacement design. The watch band slid in and snapped into place very easily.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars since I'm writing such a glowing review? The one and only reason I docked a star is because one end of the watch band is too short. Although this doesn't affect anything when wearing it, whenever I remove the watch I have to completely pull the bottom part out of the short top piece in order to get it off of my wrist. I they had made it even an inch longer that would have solved this problem. It's a minor inconvenience and nothing more than that, however it's enough for me to dock it a bit.<br /><br />This watch band will continue to stay on my Apple Watch every day until it breaks or I find something more amazing which will be hard to do.

4.0,Not as long as I'd like but sturdy and thick. Totally worth it. Strong bold colors. They are awesome for the price.
4.0,Lens are small glasses were cute
4.0,had to use stretcher on them. Will be OK for a night out.
4.0,The color isn‚Äôt quite what I expected. It‚Äôs darker than I pictured oatmeal. It‚Äôs a nice weight and serves me well!
4.0,I felt these leggings run small. I ordered a medium (I'm a size 4) and they were too tight. I couldn't keep them as I would never wear them. Other leggings have been more flattering. Order a size up!
4.0,I am basically in love with this dress.  It's very comfortable with the top being made if stretchy cotton and the print bottom being of a stretch type nylon material. My only drawback is that the top should be blue and not black.  Also the bottom material is a tad bit see through if there is a light shining through. I have it and will wear it again!
4.0,A little dark for tennis but they fit well and look good. I keep them as my backup!
4.0,They look and feel okay
4.0,I really like this dress! I wanted the ‚ÄúAbigail‚Äù dress from Baltic Born but it was sold out and this one looks just like it but half the price! Only thing is that I it does run a bit large (ordered XL) and is a little short on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 size 14/16 and could have worn a large. I plan on wearing it for holiday photos. Overall happy with it.
4.0,Received a lot of compliments on this shirt! My only complaint would be the look of the neck line. It looks &#34;unfinished&#34; and I'm worried it will start to fray when washed
4.0,"It's a beautiful product, easy to install. But the problem is the quality. The color is fading so fast, like 2 weeks (no taking shower) and the color start fading. Look at my picture: I used the blue and black with red stripes."
4.0,"Great lighter weight (but not too light weight) sweater. I ordered the red. It is NOT red but rose. Love the color so will keep it, but it is NOT RED - that's why I only gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"Needed to replace bottom on a swim suit, comfortably and dry fast."
4.0,"It was more sheer than I thought, nonetheless it is a nice beach cover up."
4.0,"Cute style, nice weight fabric. It does run a bit short. I'm 5' 3&#34; Straps are adjustable so the hold is pretty good on top. It does have some thick padding which help shapes your top.  Very cute for the price. I deducted one star for how short it runs."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter to wear as studs since she doesn‚Äôt want actual piercings, they were more gaudy than expected and like costume jewelry. I wasn‚Äôt expecting high quality, but thought they‚Äôd be a little more dainty."
4.0,"Loose in the bust. I am a size large and am a C cup. Was too tight when pulling it over my head, but the fabric sagged in my bust area. Not happy with the fit."
4.0,Very nice shirt pretty simple
4.0,Awesome watch case except that sometimes the crown button falls off and you have to wind it back on.. (luckily I haven‚Äôt lost it yet)
4.0,"This is nicer than I anticipated, very soft, love the length, looking forward to cooler temps to wear. I think it's going to be a favorite with jeans or tights."
4.0,Gems have great color.
4.0,This is really well made and I do love it! My only issue is that it‚Äôs a little bigger than I‚Äôd like. So this is not a product issue.. just my wrists are small:)
4.0,Cute summer dress. I've gotten a lot of compliments.  Only downside is it is a little clinging to my body.
4.0,Buena calidad un poco grande y muy coqueto
4.0,Telling time
4.0,Love the dress but it runs on the small side. I would order a size up in the future.
4.0,The main stone is too big.
4.0,Easy to set up and easy on the eyes.
4.0,"The top needed adjusting as it was a bit big for me, but the dress is otherwise beautiful."
4.0,"good pair of jeans, fits good and booty looks great! Gave it 4 stars because the label says jeans may bleed during washing which I didn't realize until it delivered but so far it survived one run through washer!"
4.0,Serves it‚Äôs purpose & fairly easy to operate.  Needs to be weighted down.  Not for use on windy or even slightly windy days!
4.0,"Very solid ring, as it's hard to bend. I love the way it feels on my toe...it doesn't get in the way of wearing shoes or swim fins. My only complaint is that one of the CZs fell out after about 3 weeks continuous wear."
4.0,"Fit very well in all areas but arms. It was a little tight, but I have big arms I think. The sleeves did have some stretch and loosened up."
4.0,"Love it!<br />Definitely go 2 sizes up, I normally wear a medium and but an XL and it fits as pictured."
4.0,Well constructed and good quality
4.0,The Good: Outstanding packaging. Each shade has its own firm plastic protector with lens cloth.  Clip on is easy and flip function is a breeze.  6 shades to reflect your daily color preference.<br /><br />The Bad: I wasn't paying attention as these shades are designed for a more narrow/non-round frame; which is my fault and not being penalized for my mistake.  So if you have large round frames you may wish to find the round shades.  The clip frame is on the lens and in normal view sight.  It is possible to ignore it and look past it but it does draw the eye in.<br /><br />Overall: I'm happy with them.  Even though I have larger frames these clip on easy and though they do not cover the complete lens (my fault) the still work like the sun visor on a car.  Recommend.
4.0,"I just received this dress, it is very pretty and flattering. Unfortunately, the top area is too small and I can't get the zipper up (I am rather busty (DD)). If it would have fit, I would have given it 5-stars."
4.0,Just a little to small kinda high waters
4.0,"I usually wear an xl, but got a 3x here because of the sizing chart. Fits pretty well, a little loose in the bust/shoulder, but not bad!<br /><br />Seems like it'll need careful care and regular ironing."
4.0,"I only gave it 4‚≠ê's because the top grill is a little to BG for everyday wear.Definitely need to watch how long its in the water(it was like a split sec for mine cuz the water was boiling) Also becareful with your pressed down,  the mold oozed a lil out of the grill. I was able to pick the excess off, and it fit like a retainerüòÇ Nah 4real tho it does the jobüëç"
4.0,"Happy so far, but they are thin, I don't expect them to last long"
4.0,"Beautiful hat and fits well.  BIG problem is that neither I, nor my husband, could snap the fur pompom onto the hat.  This was very disappointing; and, because I wanted to avoid the time to return the product, I sewed it on which turned out to be quite difficult.  To wash it and remove the pom pom should be an issue.  Maybe, you can send me another with the fur top snapped in!"
4.0,"It really is a beautiful dress. Very comfortable and I loved the pockets. My only problem was that it was a little see-through, so I returned it. But that was the only issue for me."
4.0,Lasts long
4.0,The ring is very pretty and the stones sparkle.  The ring can stretch out a bit if you need a little wiggle room.  Overall a great find for the price.
4.0,"These boots were very cute and would have been nice to wear.  I am normally a 6-6 1/2 in most sandals and dress shoes.  I prefer to wear a 7 in tennis shoes, so I went with a 7 in these boots.  Unfortunately, these boots run very small and a 7 fit like a small size 6. My sister, who has smaller feet, tried them and they were too small for her too. I hate I have to return them because they were a good deal."
4.0,Got what i expected.  Simple scarf.  Shipping cost too much for this light weight item.  Will work will with evening dress i purchased elsewhere.
4.0,Fun. Just want we wanted for a fun accessory
4.0,"Very flexible, perfect to wear at my exercise time. It is very good material, and price is super cheap compare to different items. Color is as described, and I was able to move flexibly and comfortably<br />while working out and doing a streching move. It is durable.nothing really. Very satisfied.all nice!"
4.0,"Fabric is very nice and soft, but the sizing is off. I typically wear size M, so to be on the safe side I ordered size L.<br />It fits like size S!"
4.0,Lovely color and very light weight. Just right for an easily packed wrap for cool tropical nights!
4.0,"Fit well the only problem, it‚Äôs a bit too long"
4.0,These are very nice earrings for the price. Size is just big enough to make a statement without being gaudy.
4.0,"I love how these look! They are also incredibly easy to use and comfortable!<br /><br />However, I have had issues with keeping them in. Some are better than others. I, unfortunately, lost the mate to my favorite pair."
4.0,"Never own a padded bike shorts so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to.  However the fabric is soft and of a light weight material. I‚Äôm a medium (unfortunately they sent me an XXL). So the padded tights fits on me loosely, and not snug like it should. Might be the reason why it feels a bit weird because it was sagging in the baddest area.<br /><br />There is a good amount of cushioning, so for bike riding I think it should do the job. The outer short does have a back zipper  pocket (about 2‚Äù deep) and a draw string. By using the drawstring It does fit me loosely. I‚Äôm a size medium 32‚Äù waist. And even though this is XXL, it definitely feels more like a large than an XXL.<br /><br />Over all i‚Äôll Probably end up just wearing the outer shorts for basketball etc, because the inner part is just too lose to feel comfortable."
4.0,"I usually wear a large. I bought a large and it fits just like a large should fit. But now that I have it. I wish I had ordered at least an extra large so it will fit over a down jacket more easily.  I haven't gotten to wear it in the rain yet. I don't know how durable it is yet. It looks very waterproof,  The zipper is decent, light weight, but not too cheap. Not as durable as you might find in a more expensive jacket. For the price it is a great deal so far."
4.0,Fits my glasses perfect.  The inside is a weird coral/salmon type of a color though...ha!
4.0,"Wonderful, comfortable, perfect for summer, the true beige color is a little darker than the image so it is more beautiful than the picture. Just wish if there were another button down so the knee does not appear while walking. Highly recommend."
4.0,They were cute but small. I ordered XL and it was not big enough. Size up.
4.0,"I bought this so I can ware it while driving to avoid UV ray hitting my face. It works very well and I love it. My husband hates it, though because he says I look like a character in Star Wars. LOL! He also said I won't get ticket if I get pictured at the intersection because my face won't be in the photo. Enough joking around. I personally like this as long as I'm in the car driving with this"
4.0,Cool glasses! And arrived on time
4.0,Cute items. The girls enjoyed them.
4.0,Nice dress runs small.Nicely made and good material.
4.0,"I like the watch. Actually a lot. The only problem is that the rotating bezel doesn't line up perfectly with the 12 o'clock posit. Also, it feels a bit loose. Just a minor gripe. The watch looks like an expensive timepiece and the seconds hand hits every minute marker. I may have a watch repair person look at the bezel, or I might just learn to fix it on my own."
4.0,"Daughter is a Hufflepuff fan so she loves the vibrant design! However, shipping took over a month despite having a US return address. Material was not as described."
4.0,A decent fit.. Unique looking shirt. Comfortable when working out.
4.0,The fit is perfect. Not to big and not to small. The only issue is that it is too long. I'm 5'2 and I need about 2 inches hemmed. In my highest heels the legs barely brush the ground.
4.0,Really cute dress. Very comfy and overall I am happy with my purchase. I gave 4 stars because it is a little longer than I thought (I ordered a small--I am 5'7&#34; 115 pounds) but that's ok because I got it to wear to work.
4.0,"I‚Äôm a fan of oversized sunglasses. And these are very oversized. I can‚Äôt even take myself seriously when I‚Äôm wearing them, but that means they‚Äôre perfect! I also like when sunglasses are opaque and only the all black pair is. I also feel like sunglasses usually have some slight curve to them to make the fit better and these do not. They are weirdly straight. Not sure how they do blocking sunlight as we don‚Äôt get much sun here in January. Maybe I will come back and edit when we get some much needed sun"
4.0,"I wear an 8 and these run a bit big on me. The heel goes above where the heel is supposed to be, but they still do the job (being no shoe socks). They're not uncomfortable with the messed up heel, it just looks funny and that is about it. I've worn different ones for a few days and they feel great."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ef60ce516dbc6559b74de2dd7ab12ea5]] Buy it
4.0,Easy fit.  Comfortable.<br />Arrived neatly packaged.<br />First time I ordered clothing on line and was satisfied.
4.0,I gave 4 stars to Amazon for such prompt return. The fabric feels like microfiber bed sheets
4.0,"Sturdy fabric considering that it's a slinky knit.  I have this in black too, and I really like them.  They're easy to dress up or down, and just the right length to wear to work.  Plus, the price is hard to beat."
4.0,"The leather portion of this briefcase is awesome. The briefcase holds my 14 inch laptop well, and I can have extra place for other items such as tablet and charger and mouse. My concern is with the black areas - they are visibly cheap - I just wish the entire briefcase was leather, or some other less obviously cheap material would have been used. The briefcase looks and feels durable and so far I did not have any issues."
4.0,"Comfy, as well as good looking, for either lounging or going out to dinner; nice wider wasteband, perfect length, not too loose or too tight, and best- deep pockets that hold my iPhone 14 ProMax without it falling out when I bend over or kneel."
4.0,This watch was more than I expected.  Good quality with a metal case.
4.0,Cute shirt just wish it was longer like it looks on the model. Great material.
4.0,Fit seems to run a bit large. The lace doesn't like to lay flat which is why I rated it 4 stars as I would have expected for it be be sown down more.
4.0,"Order at least one size up. By way of comparison, we got a size M for a lass who is a petite size 2/4 in women's clothes. Belt may be too big but she can maybe tie it in back to shorten the length.<br />I would have given it four stars except the sleeves are rather short -- probably not the coat for a tall  or long limbed girl."
4.0,"if you really want feel the cooling effect, submerse the helmet in water for a few minutes. Then let drip for a few more. I believe the British troops used to do this. The evaporative cooling will give you brain freeze."
4.0,"At first I thought the socks were too small but they were perfect on a 4 year old, as stated. However, they were a bit thin so it might be hard to place shin guards under them...hence the 4 stars.  But my granddaughter loved them!"
4.0,ok value but does have lifetime warranty!
4.0,Just the right size and configuration for a man's earring.
4.0,The pink is kind of a weird color but the shells are nice and the string holding them together is good. The back of the shells (which will rest on your wrist) are pretty smooth and it sits comfortably on your wrist. This would make a cute accessory when your at the beach but probably not something you're going to wear to a fancy dinner.
4.0,"These were a gift for my 88 year old grandmother who doesn't have her ears pierced.  She's very particular about the clasps on non-pierced earrings because they can sometimes pinch too hard and leave a mark.  The clasps on the backs of these earrings are semi-adjustable, so she was able to make them fit the way she likes them.  Beautiful earrings for the price.  Great value!"
4.0,Cumple con la limpieza pero nada del otro mundo
4.0,"This dress is good for the summer. It runs a bit large. I am 5'6"", 135 lbs, but small chested. I ordered a Medium, and I think I need a small. When you iron  it, the material stretches.  I am not a fun of the material, but it is difficult to  find good fabrics nowadays. I love the prints."
4.0,"This little bag is great!  I use it for my everyday purse because I don't need anything that could carry a small child in.  This is perfect for my wallet, keys, and phone but also has a lot more compartments that I use occasionally.  The canvas and leather are sure to stand the test of time.  Unlike many other purses and bags on the market today, it shouldn't need replacing for a LONG time!  The only criticism I have is that the zippered compartment on the front flap has too small of an opening and goes down to deep to really be useful; I have small hands and it's a tight fit for me.  I'm worried if I put something there, I might not get it out again!"
4.0,the bust part of the bra fit wonderfully. however the straps are too large and I will be making them smaller. everything else about them is nice
4.0,"These are very similar to ones I bought at Costco for three times the price. If you have a small face, these will fit nicely. The lenses are very dark.  The shape gives a nice uplift to my face. They are very lightweight. If they hold up, I'll add a star."
4.0,It is good product with reasonable price ...
4.0,*update*  after using them for some time I really enjoy the size!. Hooked more than I originally thought and they fit nicely into my purse.  I would order more.<br /><br />Original- Smaller than I expected. Was hoping to be able to use them for a shopping trip they don‚Äôt hold much
4.0,They are cute for wearing around the house but not meant to wear outside!!
4.0,Granddaughter was happy so I'm happy
4.0,Its perfect. I haven‚Äôt taken it off since I received it
4.0,Didn't care for the fabric seem all your dresses blouses are fron the same type of fabric
4.0,"Worked well for my halloween costume, I popped the lenses out because they smudged too much!"
4.0,"I like this dress. It‚Äôs well made and the material is nice. I gave it four stars because it runs small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 130lbs, 34D, waist 28. I bought large. It fits right in the chest area but perfect around the waist. The length is pass the knee."
4.0,"I ordered these laces with my three children in mind. They like to put their own shoes on and not have to worry about laces that keep coming undone. I thought these would be especially good for my twin five year old boys. When they came I was very excited to try them. I put them in my shoe first to see how they would be. They were long enough for my sneakers and would have plenty for theirs. They are easy to lace with small plastic sleeves over then ends like traditional laces. The colors are bright and fun with reflective threads running through. When I got to the end of lacing I placed the spring collar on that holds the laces in place. It is easy to adjust and get your sneakers comfortable. They then recommend you cut the laces 2-3 inches from the collar and place a plastic knob like holder to hold the ends together. I did not want to cut mine and just tucked the extra in the tongue. I thought it would be nice if the kids could use the laces again or in a different sneaker and if I cut it, I wouldn't be able to lace them again without the plastic sleeve on the ends. All in all I was pleased at the fit and comfort that these laces provided.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. All opinions are mine."
4.0,Better than grey hat purchased last year...smaller sized.. i wear a LG baseball hat.<br />has good coverage all around the perimeter lite and compact ......it has NO draw string to reduce size.
4.0,Ordered large for my husband and son. They fit them  perfectly. Both are 6 feet. Husband (pictured)  is 200 pounds. Son is 170 pounds.
4.0,The color was more turquoise than royal blue.  Still very pretty.
4.0,It helps with posture and backache .Great for gym for workout and it will make your belly sweat .
4.0,Nice although the strings that hang down are a bit long when adjusted for my small wrists.
4.0,"compact well constructed,fits the most of pocket comfortbly,holds my 4 credit cards,some cash and some membership cards wihout feeling bulky,reasonably priced,i would recommend this wallet,if someone ask``"
4.0,"Super cute, a little on the short side."
4.0,I just received the dress that I‚Äôm planning on wearing in April. It looks just like the picture and it fits very well. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it.
4.0,I bought this bra as a backup for the one I currently have. It fits me snugly (which I like) and gives me a great figure. I also love the color and the softness of the material. The one downside to this bra is it's definitely made cheaply. I've had the first bra I mentioned for less than a year and unfortunately the padding is already starting to fray. I'm expecting the same to happen with this one. But for now I am satisfied with the quality of the product and will definitely be wearing it a lot.
4.0,Love them for winter. I know my kids are making wager who gets it. Lol lol they are mine!!!!
4.0,"Love this outfit!. It‚Äôs a little scratchy because of the glitter material but overall, it‚Äôs what I expected it to be. Im really small in the chest area and I‚Äôm 135 pounds so a small was perfect for my frame and shape."
4.0,This product makes me feel safe and its comfortable
4.0,"This hat fits fine, well made , soft aqua color, not green in my opinion, but very pretty color.  Nice adjustable chin strap and tie inside the hat.  Does the job for sun protection.  I am not a hat wearer, but like the shade it provides.  Nice and lightweight."
4.0,they‚Äôre super cute n cool but mine was missing the silver one ://
4.0,"I gave these to a family member, and he's pretty pleased with them. They're soft and comfortable, and the legs don't ride up (as they have a tendency to do with some other brands). They seem to be well-made in that there aren't any loose threads. They also seem to fit pretty much true to size, but they don't offer anything in the way of support (which I know can be important for some). All in all, these are pretty good quality boxer briefs."
4.0,"I really love the bottoms, but the top is waaaaay too big for my flat chest. I'm 5'4&#34;, 145lbs and a 36B and I got the suit in a Large. The bottoms fit a little tight at first but with a little stretching they were fine. The leg holes were kind of tight but not so tight that they looked weird. Overall a flattering fit, and full bum coverage. I expected the top to be useless because I only really bought this for the bottoms. I just want to share because this suit was surprisingly really well made! I just don't recommend it for any ladies who are smaller on top."
4.0,"I was hoping the dress would have copperish or rose gold details, but they are very unmistakably gold. The seems have extra fabric hidden and coming off, and the applique isn't super well attached. I'm keeping it because I can fix it on my own, but if you are unable to do or hire someone to do the spot-sewing, ironing, steaming, and thread correction, it may not be a worthwhile purchase. Beautiful design, but the making and storing/shipping could have been a slightly higher quality and made a huge difference."
4.0,Had to but next size up
4.0,It's just a tad loose around the mid section but fits well otherwise. Wish it were a thong instead of full coverage as it looks really cute with jeans.
4.0,I work in a retail warehouse and if we want to use a bag in the main area we have to use a clear bag.<br /><br />I found this bag and it came with 4 in the purchase.<br /><br />Very good plastic nice and thick and won‚Äôt tear easy. Can hold many little things and prolly 2-3 sweatshirts or one big jacket.<br /><br />Only fault in this bag and this could be to my daily use of it. Is the area at top where the drawstrings go through. It has slowly started to tear. Not to worry since I have 3 others to use. Just curious how long til this first one I can‚Äôt use anymore. So far I have used it for 2 months.<br /><br />If you plan on using this for once I. Sheik then it‚Äôs a perfect solution. For daily there may be more durable for the strong part but then again 4 of these bags could last a year a think. Then buy 4 more for the next!
4.0,Beautiful and white and extra stretchy. Wish they offered a longer version to get a more secure wrap. But still so lovely.
4.0,The size and material was good but It came stained.
4.0,the holes are really big I was expecting them to be smaller but its still cute.
4.0,"I love this top, but it only comes down to the top of my pants. It‚Äôs kinda like a crop top. I‚Äôm 54 and it‚Äôs not appropriate for me, but would look very cute on someone younger."
4.0,"The band was easy to put on (after watching a YouTube video), but I didn't know that the fit bit band had a GPS chip in it.  So, needless to say....it's a little more complicated when you have to take the GPS out and put it in the bed band."
4.0,Fits well and I love the pockets.
4.0,"Seems to be good quality, it's just real stiff!"
4.0,"Bought XL. Fit like a MEDIUM.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 200 lbs. Does looks perfect on my daughter, she is 5‚Äô6 and 130 lbs.  Size is off. But the fabric and quality of sewing is beautiful."
4.0,Bought them for my daughter and she loves them!
4.0,"I love these. They work extremely well for the crafts I use them for. They are light for being glass, which makes them great to use as magnets. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I often get a couple in the batch that are chipped and unusable. It's usually only 1 or 2 though."
4.0,"Great for Gifts! I ordered (4) of these to give to the young kiddos for their swimming activities. For adults, I think there are some other googles out there (expensive ones), but if you are on a tight budget this is for you."
4.0,"Very nice, think and warm but wayyyyy too long. Other than that, great buy!"
4.0,"I ordered these KAOYOO Leggings for my daughter-in-law.  I had ordered a pair (different color and print) for my daughter and my DIL also wanted a pair.  I received a different fabric with the camo print.  The camo print fabric seemed to be rougher and the fit of the leggings was not quite as good.  When the fabric is stretched (as all leggings are) - the camo fabric looks a bit weird!  The fit was all right, although the waistband seems a bit loose.  All in all, these leggings are ok, my DIL will wear them, but they really are nothing special.  I'm a bit disappointed."
4.0,Very cute.  It's hard to tell sizes on line so they were smaller than expected but just the right bling
4.0,Four stars
4.0,Was great as a cover up for the beach. A bit see through otherwise but great fit and POCKETS
4.0,Made well a little tight on wish it were about an inch longer
4.0,Soft material.  Elastic on wrists could be tighter. Overall satisfied.
4.0,Neck is large.  Shirt is true to the size.
4.0,"It's a wonderful watch! I got it for my friend and she absolutely loved it! The instructions on the set up are a bit hard to follow, but we figured it out. Overall, a wonderful gift for any Death Note fan!"
4.0,"Overall a good quality material. If ordering, go down a size. Is very high waisted, over the belly button so it covers your entire stomach. Buttons were sewn a bit loose. One popped off the 1st time I wore it but that's a minor issue. Overall I  was pleased with the purchase."
4.0,We bought the 9-12 month size. Fit perfectly on my 6 month old (15lbs/25 inches).
4.0,These are great for my husband to wear around the heavy machinery at work. Only issue is they thin out too quickly.
4.0,It fits great in most areas but the cutouts on the sides pop out which ends up looking odd. My mother and I are going to stitch them back so they fit properly. My sister bought one in a larger size with the same problem.
4.0,Cute .. good quality!
4.0,great gave as a gift
4.0,Really pretty! A little bigger than I thought they'd be but they are still lightweight
4.0,This shirt is super cute but gets pilly after a few washes. You definitely need a lint brush of some sort if you want this shirt
4.0,Love the rings. The silver one is not good though. My husband wore it 1 day and all the silver started coming off and left black spots.
4.0,Really nice wallet and fast shipment.  Highly recommend.
4.0,Very close to the US Army issue web belt.
4.0,"Very nice, but is more color yellow than color gold."
4.0,"Was a little thinner than expected, but okay."
4.0,"5'3&#34;, 195. Looks great in front. Nice colors and glad I bought it."
4.0,"Nice, but fall a part in 1<br />Day. My husband glued things together and now its ok."
4.0,It was a cute costume but slightly too large for me.
4.0,Way too long.  Why is it that out of country manufactures think because you buy an extra large you must be 6 foot four I had to shorten the pants myself about 5 inches on each leg.  The product washed up nicely it‚Äôs very soft to wear and comfortable and it has pockets.
4.0,These look really nice and were sent in a nice box which they didn‚Äôt fit in. So to give as a gift it look tacky! They come in a little plastic bag and when I took them out to place in the box so they looked nice they didn‚Äôt fit. A little disappointed in the presentation but for the price they will work.
4.0,Love the material .. soft and falls on body nicely.  Dislike that the collar doesn't sit right.  Doesn't lay flat.
4.0,Beautiful design. Super tight on the arms.
4.0,"sometimes I feel like I see a purple-ish hue to these, but otherwise they are real durable, simple and extremely light to wear!"
4.0,They do their intended job but rather large for my face. They slip of my face easily.
4.0,A comfy bra for around the house. I pulled out the pads as they looked odd under a tee shirt.
4.0,It looks great and is comfortable but is super large. I was nervous the whole night that it would fall off.
4.0,Nice material has not wore it yet.
4.0,The bracelet is beautiful and it‚Äôs small enough so that it won‚Äôt fall off my wrist. It is not adjustable to make it bigger so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend someone with a big wrist to get.It looks just like picture and the colors and nice and vibrant.
4.0,Simple and very flattering long sleeves shirts. The sleeves are perfectly at my wrists but for some people they might be a little short. Overall I love the material and the comfort of the shirts!
4.0,This dress is pretty. I'm a 38c and ordered an XL. I found it a little tight through the top but the body fit well. I will wear this dress.
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous ring! Very good quality too. Very happy with it! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered it a size up because it was not available in my size(5). Sometimes, it falls off my finger but I liked it so much I had to order it! Thanks"
4.0,Overall cute dress and nice fit.  The material is thin. The heaviness of the skirt portion pulls down the top portion.
4.0,"I hate face masks that go over the ears, but didnt want to put it over my hair either. Two hearing aids with over the ear  face masks are a pain  with these i can juat pull.my chin back and the mask falls down to my neck, hands free.  Helps a tons with a kictchen job!"
4.0,If I were still employed is be very comfortable wearing this to work in an office. Pierced with a suit or just slacks this would be a nice fit.<br />I'll wear it with slacks to church and with jeans to picnics that I'm not playing directly with small kids.<br />It's breathable and stretchy. I just didn't expect the shine.
4.0,"This swimsuit is very flattering because the mid section is not tight and it is more fitted on the sides! The cups in the bra part are padded with underwire but not over the top. The straps do adjust but it didn't tighten the chest area enough, therefore the support could be a little bit better. Overall happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"The printing is a little less crisp than I‚Äôd like to see, but my kid likes them. He says they‚Äôre comfortable and more fun that a regular mask. The ear loops give it a good fit and keep them up on his face!"
4.0,I like the fabric and pocket. Not too fond of the Velcro fly.
4.0,"Very cute slippers, easy on easy off and warm"
4.0,Bought this ring as a duplicate to my wedding ring.  It is very similar to my actual ring and I wear it when I go camping and do outdoorsie stuff.
4.0,very well made and my daughter loves it but it does run a size big and she has to wait to wear it so i have no info on use i can only say how it looks and is made. the sewing on it is of what i consider good quality and the colors are beautiful just like the picture.
4.0,"very soft, and fits nicely perfect for lounging around the house, wife loves it,  dont really see a use for the hood, but everything else is really great"
4.0,I love ever thing about the dress!!!!
4.0,"The dress is beautiful- great fabric, perfect fit everywhere but the length. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and it was way too short for me. I might keep it to wear with tights, because I really like it. I just wish it was longer!"
4.0,I like this money clip.  It is certainly better looking than the large paper clip that I was using.  Kind of disappointed that it is not a little heavier tho it is very stiff and I don't think it would bend in any way.  Good enough for this old Army retiree. If it was a little heavier I WOULD have given it 5 stars.
4.0,"Bought them for my wife, who loves them. They are sized small. Otherwise the material is great - soft and pliable."
4.0,"Looks good but any amount of wind and watch out.<br /><br />Updated:  April 12, 2021<br /><br />wikiwiki reached out to me directly after the mishap with the umbrella and promptly sent out a replacement which has met my needs.  I would rate the company customer service as excellent and very interested in making you a satisfied customer.  Would buy again if the need ever arose."
4.0,"This dress came quickly, well packaged and looks just like the picture.  I purchased this dress in a size 24.  It fits like a 24.  It actually looks nice on a plus sized person.  I did add a sheer shrug to it because I don't like my arms completely exposed, but that is a personal preference. The length is very long.I'm 5'5&#34; and I needed about 5&#34; taken off.  If you need it hemmed it could get expensive due to the type and amount of fabric that needs to be taken off. I got it on sale for under $100 so paying for hemming was not a big issue to me."
4.0,Neat little watch
4.0,GREAT color and the shape is perfect!
4.0,"I note that a number of other reviewers bomb these masks. However, in my opinion they are good. They are identical to other KF94's acquired from another (Amazon) source. And they are definitely much more comfortable and wearable than N95's or KN95's, which I cannot tolerate for extended periods of time. They are judged by the US FDA as only a little less effective than N95's, and much more effective than simple cloth masks. In short, I am pleased with these. In crowded situations I will wear the KF94 and a cloth mask on top; in normal circumstances I would be fine with a single KF94."
4.0,"I tried all colors, tested polarization. Overall, really good. The were to tall to fit my glasses, though the width was perfect. Had to send the back, but if they had them on my size, I'd keep them.<br />Great communication with seller as well."
4.0,un calzado vers√°til c√≥modo
4.0,A bit smaller than expected but my wife still loves it.
4.0,Beautiful suit. But bummer you can‚Äôt buy top in different size from bottom. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 135 lbs and very small cup size. 34-36aa<br />I order up a size as everyone said it runs small. Well the large bottoms fit wonderfully. The top gapped around the pit area ( see pictures) it‚Äôs almost as if it was stretched out already. It fit everywhere else on the top. Like the bottom portion of the top around my back. That fit snug. Would be better if it was a tie back I guess. Returning.
4.0,they fall a lot when you are walking but they are good otherwise
4.0,Bought these for my daughter - she is skinny (size 0) and these gloves fit her perfectly.  I am a plus sized mama and these would not fit me.
4.0,Arrived quickly. Fits nicely.
4.0,"I bought the blue bag and I really like the color. I wanted a bag for work that would hold a laptop, a water bottle, keys, phone, lunch and other items, yet look nice. This fits the bill! It looks classy like leather but at a good price. The zippers look ok but I find them a little s ratchet. I like how many pockets it has. It is very roomy so much so that I put a smaller purse inside with my wallet when I don‚Äôt want to lug the whole bag around. My biggest complaint is that the small wrist bag that is supposed included was NOT INCLUDED. I looked inside and out and no bag!it‚Äôs a good bag for the price BUT they should not advertise it as coming with both if they aren‚Äôt going to include both."
4.0,"These laces are as thin as normal laces, not wide at all, but they really are good quality, a nice deep color, and well made, I will still use them I'm sure."
4.0,We bought this for our son because we lost the one he got in the Black Hills. The one we got from the Black Hills was cheaper and better quality.
4.0,I like the shirt and it looks like the picture. I ordered the white and i do have to wear a tank top underneath. However that was expected. I would order from this company again however  I do wish it were the fit were a little looser and longer so I would probably size up next time.
4.0,"Super soft and comfortable, but a little too big for my liking. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll shrink afterward the first wash."
4.0,"I love the concept of the zipper. However it doesn't zip all the way across. This then defeats the purpose of the zipper when you have to remove the outfit for a change. My little one fell asleep in this outfit and it was the hardest diaper change in her lifetime. I tried to change her diaper without taking the outfit off and doing with the zipper open. Trying to get her feet out from outfit is a dead end as well. All in all, still a super cute outfit"
4.0,"These socks offer a nice compression, however they are very long. They fit above my knees which can be uncomfortable.<br />Fabric is nice, no issues after washing them. Combination of colors and design looks amazing."
4.0,"This camisole is long, a  non see through, and perfect for a dress lining.  I only wish they would make more colors available."
4.0,Fits a little small. I typically wear a large because I prefer my shirts to be a little loose (not baggy and not snug) The shirt does not fit like pictured. It is a bit more snug and the sleeves are a little short. The sleeves come about one inch above my wrists. I would definitely order one size up. The shirt is also good quality material. It‚Äôs soft and not see through which is always a plus!
4.0,"It took 8 weeks to arrive. Ugh.  Also, I read the reviews and based on what people said i ordered a size up. And its too big.  I am 5'7 size 10 pants and a DD chest, a large would have been perfect.  I ordered an XL based on reviews and its way too big,  but I am going to try to shrink it in the wash rather than wait another 8 weeks for a smaller size.  Otherwise, this dress is adorbs. Love the red."
4.0,Nice and shiny ordered for brides maids
4.0,[[VIDEOID:9abf1e02fdf4dd89abab09923164f644]] It will fit in any pocket that a cell could.
4.0,"I ordered this dress despite misgivings about the raw hems in the ruffled sleeves.I'll try to live with it and see how the unraveling goes. It's a bit long on me since I am only 5 ft. Tall. The other measurements are fine on my fluffy body. The fabric feels like t-shirt fabric but there's no give, and it is a nice weight and quite warm. It is not see-through. I purchased the gray for a variety in my dress wardrobe but I am tempted to buy the wine color since that was my first choice."
4.0,Bought the purple purse and have been stopped several times with compliments on it. Would definitely buy again.
4.0,Love this dress! Very comfortable and flowy!
4.0,Sleek design and a great hard case for my reading glasses. Comes with a cleaning clothes in each case.
4.0,I love the color choice but it's hard to remove
4.0,My bride spends hours in our gym at home each week and needs plenty of shorts/tee's.<br /><br />These shorts are not expected to make a designer statement but they seem well put together and should hold up fine for what my wife uses them for.
4.0,The material is terrible.
4.0,High waisted and a little baggy in the knees but good.
4.0,The product overall was good. Little flimsy & not much variety. You may get 10 of the same item.
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, lace a lot more stiff than the picture shows."
4.0,"Perfect size, I love the style but the bag is a beige not white :) that‚Äôs my only qualm!"
4.0,"I just love these blazers!  They are so comfortable!  Only reason I didn't give them five stars is they use a navy blue to outline their color, which is hard to color match.  Black would have been a much better choice."
4.0,"over time the leather has worn down significantly and the wear does not look like good worn leather - for the first year though, this looked nice."
4.0,Love the hat and whistle
4.0,Bought this for a friend who had been looking for this very 90's neckless. Item was exactly what I ordered and my friend is happy and looks good wearing it. It cost more than the $.25 i used to pay in the vending machines now but made for a good cheap gift so its good.
4.0,They are nice looking glasses but are very wide. I constantly worry about them slipping off my head and they do slide down my nose. I'm keeping them as a back up to a different pair I bought.
4.0,I'm almost completely happy with this purchase however I recieved one that wasnt the same color as described.  The one I recieved is almost entirely red and green with some light blue.  Theres no turquoise or purple woven in so that was a little disappointing.  It looks to be more Christmas appropriate.  It is soft and very big so I still gave four stars.  Also it came on time and was such a great price.  I was really excited about all the pretty colors it was supposed to have though.
4.0,"I liked the looks of the sterling silver and the pearls.  However, the hooks to attach the earrings are small and difficult to put on."
4.0,"cute, great  fit. love"
4.0,"Very pretty, they look beautiful on. A bit heavy for my ears so I take them off as soon as I get home and rub my earlobes for a few seconds. Other than that, very nice earrings."
4.0,"I love this bralette, but it's a little too small.  I am a 38DD and the extra large was a little small.  I still like it and will be able to wear it under shirts, but it barely covers for being a Xlarge."
4.0,pretty but tight fitting.
4.0,"I like the shape and color and feel of the glasses however there's one major design flaw and that it it has no indentation for it to sit on your nose. I am aware that if there were such an indentation, the nose would stick out from within the shield and would definitely look funny. However, with some time, you'll figure out a comfortable way to wear them."
4.0,"It's really nice dress. My only complaint is the sizing. I ordered a large (12) based on the chart, but it's too big for me."
4.0,this was a nice purse and I would have liked to have kept it but it was not big enough for me. if it came in a bigger size then I would see if it would work for me and be roomy enough to hold all of my things.<br />I love the color and you should have a whole lot more items that come in this color as well  for those who love purple like I do the wine color just does not do the same .
4.0,This is gorgeous! It's for a person with a small neck; it fits perfectly on my junior bridesmaid!
4.0,"My granddaughter loves this. The top is too big for her as is the panties, but the tail skirt fits. Overall it is wonderful. I bought one size up from her age."
4.0,"SUPER  soft material and nicely made. The coat looks of high quality with BRILLIANT color. I ordered the Berry size 7/8. My child is 7 and a bit shorter than an average 7 yr old. Fits perfectly with room to grow! This coat isn‚Äôt as thick as I expected, but it‚Äôs warm enough for TEXAS on most cold days, but wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be warm enough for snow environments though. We Texans are a bit wimpy in really cold weather! Lol! It is not water resistant as stated in details. Great for average cold/dry days."
4.0,"Great no-show socks! A bit thin, but I'm not exactly running marathons in them. Comfortable no-slip grip on the heel and above the arch of the foot minimizes chafing. Out of site and out of mind with chucks or boat shoes!"
4.0,Nice light rain jacket
4.0,Like wearing a piece of artwork. Very substatial and highly crafted. I<br /><br />would recommend it for males beacause it is big and fairly heavy.<br /><br />I have a piece I bought for $38 and this design is similar. Great for silver chain and for casual dress up. Tough to beat for the price!It definitely stands out.
4.0,"I really like these, they are very comfortable, and look great"
4.0,The top requires ironing and the bottom is as expected w/o.  Nice feel overall and snug fit!
4.0,Loved the dress & style but I‚Äôm short waited & it didn‚Äôt look good on me & will be returning the dress
4.0,"Very nice sound, and two rings for one push of lever. Well made and well designed. Get two, they're fun!"
4.0,I am long wasted; the size 2 hit me in the ribs
4.0,"Perfect touch to give your bridesmaids.  Decent quality for the price, well packaged, very cute and fun idea.  My Bridesmaids loved them!"
4.0,"The fabric is solid, holds you in tightly and looks great."
4.0,"Muy bonitas. Muy buen acabado. Y el lente bueno.<br />Lo √∫nico malo, la caja. Es demasiado grande para llevarla contigo. Bonita s√≠, poco √∫til."
4.0,Very Expedient!
4.0,I gave 4 stars because I love the shirt but its a tight fit
4.0,"I have a health condition that requires me to use compression socks and I've purchased Copper Fit several times before. Delivery was quick and everything was good, I washed the two pairs and wore them each once. No problems, but when I was trying to wear one of the pairs the second time, one of them tore halfway across the calf! This is the first pair of compression socks that I've ever had to tear?"
4.0,"This dress is ideal for everyday wear. The fabric is a lightweight knit with stretch. You can put it on over your head or use the side zipper. The neckline has enough fabric to cover your girls for modesty even if you're a larger cup size. The defined waistline is very flattering on many shapes and sizes. The sleeve length makes this good for transitional weather. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The fit is true to size. My normal size medium would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Nice packaging. Surprised this product is so inexpensive. Haven't got a chance to use outside yet.
4.0,"The quality is good, it appears to be durable and beautiful. This is a great gift.<br />Do not settle for the cheaper versions."
4.0,Zipper gets stuck every now n then but other than that fits great. a good buy!
4.0,Like the way it fits and was a reasonable priced.
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Quality isn't great, but for the price, that's expected. It's sexy, fits as expected, and is pretty versatile."
4.0,"It‚Äôs not AS VIBRANT as advertised but it‚Äôs okay. It has a drawstring in the back to adjust to your liking. I got this to wear ON TOP of my mask and it works fine. It also helps to keep my hands off my face (since my other mask suffocates me). When I adjust my mask now, I‚Äôm touching this covering instead of my face. I haven‚Äôt washed it yet. Only Lysol‚Äôd it when I received it and let it dry. But when I wear it out tomorrow I will wash it and give an update if it fades or gets damaged in the wash."
4.0,"These socks are thinner than I was expecting. ""Cozy"" isn't the word I'd use to describe these. Their thickness reminds me of men's dress socks. They are basic wool/spandex/acrylic blend socks. They do fit me well and seem well made. These socks would be great for mild fall and spring weather. They went through the wash and came out good as new!"
4.0,"These are nice bracelets, the sequins flip well. My only complaint is that the slap band metal cut through the end of it‚Äôs sequin sleeve and was useless after that. I couldn‚Äôt stitch it together because it‚Äôs a tight fit and I‚Äôm not that motivated to try hard to fix it. I think she would have preferred a t-shirt with these sequin things but this was a good stocking stuffer and they would curl up in to plastic eggs too for Easter Egg Hunt treats."
4.0,Definitely slim fit. It‚Äôs cute. (Saying something since I never dress down casually) Pills a lot so be sure to get a garment shaver.
4.0,"I love the style and removable pads idea.  It is a bit snug for me especially with the pads that came with it, so I don't wear it more than my work out routines go. I also switched out the pads with thinner ones that I already had."
4.0,"it fit as expected and looks like what i expected it look, so just fine. not great but i didn't expect great."
4.0,Very nicely done and well made
4.0,The color is a little darker than appears online. Great fit not to short comes just above the knee I'm about 5'2. Material is nice and dress is comfortable. True to size.
4.0,Love these and wear them everyday however the second pair I bought weren't as rounded on the edges. Regardless I still find them to be my everyday earring and I only clean them like twice a week but other than that I keep them in 24/7 and haven't had any issues.
4.0,"The connection piece that connects to the watch was poorly made and broke. I threw it away and went back to the rubber strap band that came with the watch.<br />An update, customer service contacted me and replaced my band for no cost. The new band is functioning properly and I've experienced no problems with it. Their cust serv is fantastic."
4.0,"For the most part these are good, however I still have issues with some clips coming off."
4.0,It is nice but I think if you make it bigger you will break it üòê
4.0,"This is a cute, silky satin pajamas it. It‚Äôs advertised that I can be one outdoor, but to each its own. I will say I use the sizing chart for measurements and fitted accordingly. Light weight, comfortable. Great to go to sleep in."
4.0,"We got these goggles for our son for Christmas. He really likes the look, feel, and size of these. The one thing he is unsure if is the tint. When I put these on my adult head they fit great. I also tried putting them on a ATV helmet and they worked great. The strap is easily adjustable and has a rubber strip in the material that helps the goggles stay in place. I as well as my son like these. Unfortunately here in Utah this year we haven‚Äôt had enough snow for my liking and have not used them like I thought I would this winter. So for this reason I‚Äôm only giving them a 4 star because they did fog over for a few seconds then cleared right up, but they haven‚Äôt been tested for longer periods of time."
4.0,"I liked the way this suit had good coverage, and I also liked the style of the suit. It will be used for swimming in the ocean and possibly paddle-boarding."
4.0,"I bought this watch three months ago and have been using it daily. I was concerned about its water resistance, but it's withstood the beach, daily showers, and general everyday abuse without so much as a scratch.<br /><br />It's a shame that the stopwatch function on this watch is limited to one hour‚Äîthis means that if you leave it running and forget to stop it before an hour is up, it will simply restart again at 0:00. The watch also lacks a countdown timer feature.<br /><br />I also dislike the placement of the button to toggle 24 hour and 12 hour modes. It's always getting snagged on things and switching me back between time modes."
4.0,These worked just great for my last trip. because i could see through them i did not have to guess what cube i needed when i was living out of my bags. I would recommend these and buy them again for my college aged kids.
4.0,Under Armour makes some of the best snowboarding socks. I never have to worry about them sliding down like a lot of the other socks out there.
4.0,Came right on time. Great for the price. Only 2 of the 40 didn't work. They also offer tracking info
4.0,"These are lovely earrings, but they are definitely more of an antiqued gold/brass color than silver. Shown with a pair of silver earrings for comparison. I still like them very much, so four stars, but this isn‚Äôt quite what I thought I was buying."
4.0,"It‚Äôs way wider than I expected, but it‚Äôs comfy and the quality seems great."
4.0,Good quality material and very comfy in sun. I love this product.
4.0,very very cute and comfy but pils very easy and very fast.
4.0,its very pretty.. and it comes in a cute silver box which was very cute
4.0,"Good description in listing. Shipped quickly and delivered in very secure packaging. Slightly thinner than others, but excellent value"
4.0,"Gorgeous suit, I'd agree with the other reviews and say it feels high quality. If there were a larger size I would have gotten it, my love handles stick out like crazy (I'm a US 8-10 usually) but I'm using it as motivation to work out and eat healthy. No complaints"
4.0,"Got it for a friend's Christmas gift and he put it on at the party that night because he was so excited about it. Started out with a bottle, but it didn't sit right and the bottle kept tilting forward to the point it almost spilled several time. Cans work better."
4.0,The color isn't as vibrant as I thought.  It is a thin dress and you will probably need something to wear underneath.
4.0,It looks real and is very pretty. It was a gift and I like it.
4.0,good price good buy
4.0,cute anklet but i wish there was a way that i didnt have the end of the chain dangling around.
4.0,"The Kinetic line by Sorel is incredible comfortable and I have others that are stylish and I would wear with a casual summer dress.  I am keeping these for summer comfort walking, but they are somewhat orthopedic looking, truthfully."
4.0,I love this dress. So classy and it's not as short as shown on the model which I love. Absolutely love this dress.
4.0,Meet my need
4.0,Feels very silky and smooth against the skin. Fits as expected.  Material is heavier than I thought it would be.
4.0,"Material is not the best, but it‚Äôs cute!"
4.0,"Its a beautiful dress but had to return it. I bought red color but its not really a bright red just like on the picture, its like a burgundy color."
4.0,"My only problem with this bra is that it's a little bulky. Other than that, it's amazing. My boobs are a b cup and it made them look like d cups. 10/10 recommend for smaller chests."
4.0,"Once you get past the struggle to get the backing tape off, it is a great product. Recommend using a razor blade to seperate the tapes.The sponge takes the stress out of having to wear my hat."
4.0,These are very cute medium sizr earrings. They are soft when uou squeeze them!  They come with little plastic backings . You just have to cbheck you bag that the earings come in carefully.
4.0,Great buy.  Just as expected.
4.0,A nice look. These slides were a replacement for a pair of Adidas soccer sandals that were stolen. The first thing I noticed was that the sole felt rather stiff whereas the Adidas were a little more cushioning. I appreciate the ventilation through the sole and through the sandal. Would purchasse again.
4.0,The gloves look great and I like the build quality. Love the color. Great padding and feel on your handlebar grip.  A good bargain biking gloves.
4.0,"I was so excited to send my son this bracelet.  Although he put it on right away, I was disappointed that the card with the message was nowhere to be found.  What a shame.  My son's away in college."
4.0,"Too tiny, appeared to be larger"
4.0,"Product was what I expected for it only being $3, was shipped quickly."
4.0,"This scarf seems to be perfect for fall weather! It is thin enough to be lightweight, but thick enough to be effectively warm. It is a fairly big size and can be worn in many versatile ways because of this.<br /><br />This scarf feels nice and soft to the touch. It is not scratchy and does not cause an itchy feeling. I wore it for some hours at a time and did not become uncomfortable from the scarf.<br /><br />Immediately after opening it, I noticed that the scarf has a factory-like smell to it, likely from its production process. Although, this can be resolved from it being either washed or even just spritzed with some linen freshener or body spray to handle that. Also, when I opened the scarf and took a look at it fully, there was a bit of the fabric bundled together, but this was resolved by pulling on the edges of the scarf to straighten it back into place.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase. I would recommend this scarf to friends who are interested in a quality scarf for less money."
4.0,"I ordered a small but it still fit a bit loose. I wore this to the gym but I was able to tie a knot on the side, and had no other problems w it."
4.0,"this shirt fits me very well overall.  i usually have issues where shirts in my size vary a lot in their actual size.  the shirt is very soft, too, and hasn't shrunk after being washed.  the only little gripe is the neck hole is a bit small.  if i could give 4.5 stars I would."
4.0,"Not sure it is 100% silk, but it is more comfortable than others. Color is perfect."
4.0,Perfect work shoes and great for travel to cobblestone covered countries!
4.0,Would have liked to have give this item five stars but the item came and a plastic bag and was badly wrinkled. Sweater fit very well. I actually stretched the sweater out on an exercise ball and sprayed it down with filtered water. Wrinkles came out and sweater is just fine.
4.0,"Great necklace, bought another one from here too. The only thing is that the packaging although compact is pretty bad to gift someone as. Like its just kind of ugly and a kind of awkward size, but I guess you get what you pay for. The product itself is pretty great."
4.0,"I was looking for a funky purse, and this certainly fits the bill.  I just wish it had more zippers and compartments inside.  Things can really get lost in there."
4.0,"I like colors and fit, but wish the fabric was softer."
4.0,"Love the quality, just wished the bar was a little shorter"
4.0,Cute!! Form isn‚Äôt perfect but it‚Äôs pretty cute
4.0,"Love the color and the fabric softness is amazing.<br />I'm 5' 7&#34;, 118 lbs and for XS... the pj's are a bit roomy and sleeves are rather long (but can be turned up)."
4.0,"This suit is beautiful, but the cups were too small for me.<br /><br />My bra size is a 32DD (equivalent cup size to a 36C/34D).  I took a chance hoping that the XL might fit a 36C and therefore accommodate my cup size, since the manufacturer and other reviewers have mentioned A/B/C but cup size is relative to band size so a letter is meaningless without the band measurement.<br /><br />Sadly for me, the XL top might fit a small 38A/36B/34C/32D or full 38AA/36A/34B/32C since there is both permanent and removable padding in the cups.<br /><br />The back is adjustable and will fit any strap size and the pearl halter straps are beautiful, but I didn't want to take a chance that the XXL might also be a little too small, so I went with a different option."
4.0,Great product. Exactly as described.
4.0,Really cute ... looks very similar to Herm√®s . But too thin to tie on my ponytail .better use on a handbag
4.0,"Super cute and got when expected, but one of the back pieces came cracked"
4.0,Beautiful suit. Bottoms a little smaller than I expected but great colors!
4.0,Very cute for my special occasion. I‚Äôm pretty sure the color won‚Äôt last for another event though. So it‚Äôs like a one time use costume jewelry.
4.0,I like that I had a variety of pieces and that they are very comfortable
4.0,"First Jerzees shirt of this type I've had.  Can't find anything wrong with it, and I plan to order a couple more.  Body and sleeves long enough even though I'm a bit tall.  Good shirt."
4.0,Pretty dope ass dress for my wedding
4.0,This is a short kimono top with an open front. It is a one size fits most. This works well as a very lightweight cover over an outfit. You can also wear it over a swimsuit or a shorts type outfit. I find that it really enhances some of my outfits.
4.0,The Aqua 4 is highly recommended for aquatics sports but I found the fit a tad tight in terms of length. I wear a solid 8 and have for decades so I bought an 8 in this shoe and found my toe tends to push against the top of the shoe. I think it will be fine and going up a 1/2 size would have been too sloppy.
4.0,"Fits well, not too thin."
4.0,"Compared with the original factory watchband, this one has fewer holes in the strap. It rattled around my wrist until I punched one more hole closer to the watch. It's an unnecessary annoyance, but not a big deal if you have a leather punch handy (I didn't) or a hammer and awl (I did)."
4.0,A little to skinny. But I gave it to a highschool kid who ended up liking it a lot.
4.0,"Great fit and material, but Zipper keeps sticking and coming apart."
4.0,"I just got my band today and it looks and feels amazing! I love the color and the flexibility of the band. Yes. the band is smaller than the one you get with the Gear S2. For example, with the S2 band I have to use the smallest hole on the band but on the V-MORO band I can use the 2nd to smallest hole. It looks great on my watch and the install was easy--thanks to YouTube. The band is hard to take off. I haven't been able to remove mine yet.. Yes I am currently trying to take it off while writing this review. Well, hopefully I figure it out sometime. If not well, the band still looks nice and matches all of my business outfits."
4.0,It's super cute! I love the top but the bottoms are a bit small. I'm still very happy!
4.0,"Definitely feels cheap, but it looks fine. It's held up for about half a year now without signs of falling apart."
4.0,"Warm but not too warm.<br />I'm a size 6 1/2 shoe and these fit my feet great.<br />A bit too snug on my calves  but, not too tight to continue wearing."
4.0,Arma a little small other then that great
4.0,very lightweight shirt. Happy with my purchase.
4.0,Adorable! I have a long Torso so it's perfect with leggings. I wish the arms/sleeves were longer like in the picture. I get compliments all the time. Very cute.
4.0,The arch support is great. A little stiff but I expect that will improve with use. The shoe itself fits very true to size. The back elastic straps are much too long and no way to adjust. With the ability to tighten the toes the slippers will stay on. Will likely cut the elastic and tighten for a better fit.
4.0,Very cute after u get over the zipper in the back up by neck line. Seemed a little strange at first but unzipped the shirt falls perfectly off shoulders
4.0,"I did not think it would be really good quality for the price...but I was really surprised. The necklace was beautiful, very strong metal. I gave as a gift, and they absolutely loved it."
4.0,It was ok<br />I was hoping for more pockets though
4.0,such a cute outfit!
4.0,"This is a wonderful sweater!! The fleece lining makes it extra cozy and warm.  Super soft and comfy! The sleeves could be a bit longer but otherwise, absolutely love it!"
4.0,Cute and functional design.  Would purchase again.  Not quite as soft as other pairs I own but they work fine...
4.0,Too fit as expected but the bottom is a lil big for me but it's cute I like it
4.0,I am tall and skinny af and ordered a small. The dress is so wide I don't know what to do with it. It looks nice but I am swimming in the thing.
4.0,I like the dress.  Very classy.
4.0,"size was right and loved the bright blue color of it, have ordered two more, only negative detail was that one  the inside pockets was a bit unsewn, fixed in less than a minute to reinforce it, so no big issue."
4.0,Very good quality as expected but fits way too small
4.0,Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Good looking and well put together.
4.0,Fits as expected but the picture looks better
4.0,"Beautiful suit. Since Miraclesuits fit snuggly, I ordered up one size. May return;unsure. Neckline is a bit more open than expected. It's hard to give accurate feedback since I've only tried it on."
4.0,"Like the ‚Äúbling‚Äù. Would have liked some instruction. I‚Äôm in between link lengths, but like it very much."
4.0,super cute and girly
4.0,"caution, narrow"
4.0,"Awesome mask if your a collector, not very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"It was definitely well tailored.  I returned it because it is not what I was looking for and the Eagle was hard to show on the face which is what I wanted.  But I did think, ‚Äúwow these are really soft and well tailored.‚Äù  I would consider buying singles, but hard to make them cost effective with shipping."
4.0,Shorter than expected. This hits me about the top of my hips. I'm 5'7&#34; and have a long torso. A little lighter in color and soft. Looks good.
4.0,Nice little charms. Lighter than I needed but I will find something else to do with them. Very pretty
4.0,"Gym bag,  Travelling bag and work bag"
4.0,The hat is great and fit my daughter perfectly. The material feels solid and all left to do now is see for how long it will hold.
4.0,"The top is beautiful colors with just enough bling and I love that it is cotton fabric.  The top runs large, so I am ordering smaller size."
4.0,"I am not as tall as the model so it looked better in picture than on me, but I do love how it is so easy to throw on. I do wish there were more buttons sewn in to the shoulder straps to bring the bottom up for those of us who are petite. The flared buttons are not as flattered in person so I would be aware of that of that the look you want. My final comment is that linen in general wrinkles easily so after wash the straps need to be ironed out flat so they don‚Äôt resemble spaghetti straps."
4.0,This looks look on and fits great. It would be perfect if you didn't have to iron. I love the color and the cool fabric.
4.0,"I purchased my normal size, a medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 130lbs. Sleeves only went to my wrists so size up for the oversized look in the pictures. I ended up keeping the medium because I still liked the material and the fit."
4.0,They look exactly like picture
4.0,It was a very nice watch for the money
4.0,"Thinner than expected. Very soft. Seam along the top of toes. Probably fine for office wear, but I wanted something for more active wear, and they are not that."
4.0,A little too big.  Nice soft fabric.  Pricier than comparable items.
4.0,"Very cute!!  The suit runs small by regular standards, but fits perfectly if you go by the seller&#34;s recommended size-chart. I'm 5'7&#34; and 135lbs. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. The strings are adjustable so you can make it tighter or looser depending on how you want it to fit. Over all, I am happy with the cost, the fit , the look and the construction."
4.0,just a good wallet!
4.0,Little darker in color than I wanted. But sturdy and quick delivery. Well packed
4.0,The shirt fit nice and the tie was too short.
4.0,Used for pandemic trick or treating. Good buy!
4.0,"The pajama's are soft and warm, and very comfortable; however, I wear petite clothing 90% of the time. The pajama's are not, so the pants were a bit long and the sleeves on the top were too long. I still can wear them, but I wish a petite size would have been available."
4.0,"I love this scarf! It's so pretty,  I just wish it was a little longer."
4.0,They r okay
4.0,I like it but it wasn't as long as depicted.
4.0,Not as fancy as in the picture but they're still really cute!
4.0,"I pulled off a super easy Cheshire Cat costume with these...just added a pink t-shirt. The tail was a bit shorter than I anticipated, but the pieces are well made and will stand up to the wear and tear of many more Halloweens and dress-up by my daughter."
4.0,Nice look and feel but shrink to much not leaving enough room for everything to fit
4.0,"Super comfy. Liked the one I ordered for my mother so much I ordered one for myself. But, the color was not as shown so I returned. Very good quality and easy to return. Would have ordered a replacement but, they didn't have the black in my size."
4.0,I've done two rides so far and I like them a lot. I probably could've gone a size smaller but I was afraid they would be too small. They're good enough anyways. Comfortable for sure and I love the color!
4.0,"Overall, this was comfortable.  I really liked the classy look when paired with a blazer.  This material is very soft and stays cool.  This is a loose fit, so if you are looking for the more fitted look, you may consider sizing down.<br /><br />Not sure how long these would last as it does feel a little cheap; however, this would be good when it lasts, so time will tell I guess."
4.0,"Beautiful design. I wish the hands were longer, but the length does result in good contrast against the navy."
4.0,Love the hat. But it was bent on arrival.  Feels like soft cardboard on the rim. Not hard like a regular cap. Im gonna iron it to see if it straightens it out.<br />Update: i was able to get the bend out the hat. But place another fabric over rim while ironing cause material will melt if extreme heat is place in 1 area too long. And no i didn't damage my hat but i noticed the issue and placed a fabric over it and was able to achieve the roundness of the rim of hat
4.0,"Smaller then it appeared on line.  Looks pretty though, have not used it yet.<br />Thinking about giving it to a young lady, who would appreciate the smallness better."
4.0,Liked the nautical print & style but sizing is off scale...ordered my regular size....just about fit over my head .... cut is too small & tight
4.0,Great watch that had been very durable. The rubberized strap is a little stiff so that it's somewhat uncomfortable to wear at times. Looks great and keeps accurate time.
4.0,"Super cute!  A bit snug, but I like my pj's loose."
4.0,"Its good, just a little bigger than expected but overall awesome"
4.0,Need pockets for workout at the gym.
4.0,Cute dress. Runs a bit small though. Suggest sizing up one
4.0,I'm not sure I could wear it anywhere but around the house or at the beach but I really like it!  I usually wear a 16 and ordered an XL which is large and loose on me.  It is also see through.  I'm hoping that with washings the fibers will 'fluff up' and I'll be able to wear it out and about.  Really comfortable and pretty.  The back is cut very low also.
4.0,"This is a beautiful top. It fits comfortably, the lace is a nice pattern, the lace is durable, and the lining is not &#34;see through. However, the coral color is more of an orange than the red pictured on the screen. It is a beautiful, bright, and warm coral color. That color does not look good on me. I have a very fair complexion with dark blonde hair (silver hair is also present). So, I am returning the coral top and ordering the ivory color top instead. This top is perfect for dressing-up a skirt, pants, nice leggings, or a suit."
4.0,"The dress looks exactly like the pictures. I'm 5'2, 110 pounds and it was a little long for my taste (about knee length). However, I just washed and dried it and it shrunk to a length that I liked. I would definitely recommend washing in cold water and air drying it. Is somewhat sheer, but the pattern obstructs a lot."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7ee015a3a8c92fe0e18b2906929f174f]] Only issue I had was my card got stuck on the second slot in the back, I think it was glue... I needed two other people to pry out my card. Other than that it‚Äôs a really good product, hold everything I need."
4.0,Very nice . My grandson liked it.
4.0,"The only thing that bothers me is the top of the pants aren't as stretchy so it can be a little uncomfortable, but other than that, they fit nicely and look great."
4.0,Very cute wife likes it
4.0,I really liked it was well put together and pretty
4.0,Muy lindo pero enviaron color equivocado
4.0,The size of the tag is just the right size
4.0,I didnt look at the sizing before buying and it's so small its unusable for myself but an adorable gift for my niece.
4.0,"I really love brooks. I have 2 pairs of the exact same Caldera's and they are my favorite shoe I have ever owned! I was looking to replace them with a cheaper pair, so I bought these. With my Caldera's I can wear any kind of sock and still be very comfortable, but with these I have to wear light socks or they feel too tight. I have a pretty narrow foot. I wear a size 9 and the length is a perfect fit. If you have a wide foot you might want to try a wide or not get these. I don't really run, I walk a lot and these are just for every day comfort, running errands, keeping up with my 3 year old, ect. I had a problem with my Cascadia's wearing out where the shoe bends naturally, and I don't think I will have that problem with these. Because they are very light weight I am worried I will wear through them faster than normal, but I've had them for 2 weeks and even though I don't absolutely love them, I'm keeping them because I can't seem to find any other tennis shoe that is as good."
4.0,Bought these for my son to replace a pair similar that had worn out. He‚Äôs a 10 year old boy so he‚Äôs not the gentlest on his clothes. They‚Äôve held up well and he says they are very comfortable.
4.0,Unfortunately the post fell off the third time I put them through. I like the earrings but plan to return them as soon as I can. Hopefully they can be exchanged or I'll have to get a refund.
4.0,"This was cute and stylish. The hem is not as long as pictured, but it is still cute!"
4.0,So beautiful. Didn't realize this until after I bought it that it's hard to wear with shoes.
4.0,Really like this belt...I am able to wear it with many long and short summer dresses.
4.0,Comfortable and warm.... As far as the Finger tips and being able to use a touchscreen phone... Well let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs out the picture. They aren‚Äôt sensitive enough to use any touchscreen device with them.
4.0,I like black dress but ugly thong. It's too large size for me. I will fix it as size ;)
4.0,"Little larger and looser fit than I expected, I do like the color though."
4.0,"Brilliant watch. Nice, light and easy to read. Really affordable too. Thanks again."
4.0,"CUTE!  But also very thin (yet very comfortable) so you can see your cellulite if you have any!  Again, very comfy though.  I just wear them around the house."
4.0,I love these brand. The only problem I have had is one ripped after 2 washes. My other two pairs are fine i checked them out to make sure. Must have been a defect in this one pair.
4.0,"This dress is so beautiful!  My daughter is 5'2&#34; and 115 pounds and the small fit her very well.  The length was the only issue as she would need very high heels or have it hemmed.  This dress reminds me of something an Old Hollywood starlet would wear.  My daughter didn't like this one as much as some others we had ordered for prom.  She felt it was pretty but a little plain for her.  If you are looking for something with classical elegance,  this is a great choice!"
4.0,for walking and for outdoor volleyball
4.0,Love the look and construction is about what you would expect for the price. Too small for my head though.
4.0,Can't beat it for the price. The front pockets however are poorly designed. They're really small and the inner fabric sticks out every time you pull out your hand.
4.0,Excellent  am 5'2&#34; and weigh about 103 so they were a drop baggy but I am very pleased with them
4.0,"Only complaint it was a little more cheeky than I was wanting as a new mommy. I bought a medium and am usually med/large (5'2"", 155lbs and 34C cup). The rest of the suit fit perfectly...shows a little cleavage for sure. :)"
4.0,"I wasn't sure what kind of quality we would get with this since it was so affordable, but we love it.  Very sturdy and it is great quality."
4.0,I was excited to receive my gift to my princess on adoption day! Something inexpensive but heartfelt. She will love it!<br /><br />I just wish the heart sizes were equally matched. Otherwise it is really sweet
4.0,A little bigger sizes for men luv it anyway
4.0,so elegant and flatering
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but I think my boyfriend will absolutely love it for Valentine‚Äôs Day"
4.0,"This dress is a great summer staple. It has to be dried flat though, so it will need to be ironed after washing.<br /><br />It has pockets! I love a dress with pockets. The cute is flattering and the color is vibrant!"
4.0,"Great dress for various body types. My co-workers and I all got this dress and it looks great on all of us. We are all different body shapes, heights, and sizes. I ordered a 2X. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and wear a size 16 and have DD boobs and it fits great!"
4.0,Cute and comfortable for my hair. Attractive pattern. Soft to the touch.
4.0,Very nice fabric. Well made. Does not bunch or &#34;crawl&#34;. Fits true to size. Washes well. This is a much better quality than the cotton variety I am replacing. I would recommend it. * One caution is that we have two cats and my daughter came home from dance and was loving on the cat and was subsequently covered in cat fur! This fabric seems to be a MAGNET for cat hair! Now I know to take it off as soon as she comes through the door so I won't have to spend 15 minutes lint rolling!!
4.0,I am very pleased with the fit and quality of tge biketard. I can work our without concern that any of my bits will fall out.
4.0,Love this dress. I received tons of complments on it. I am 5'5 129lbs and ordered a Medium and it fit me perfectly. The only issue is the neckline keeps folding down.
4.0,"Cost: 5/5<br />Reason for purchase: My daughter easily misplaces masks and I wanted some that were disposable that I could keep in her backpack or in the car in case we needed a backup.<br />Quality:  3/5.<br />Ease of use: My 5 year old can put these on herself.<br />Pros: Cute pattern! Serves its purpose. You get a lot for the money you spend.  These are perfect for quick trips to the store or quick visits outside the home.<br />Cons: The strings break very easily, which I wish I would have known before I sent her with it on the first day of school. I try not to use these for school anymore because it‚Äôs very easy for the strings to snap off if your child is taking them on/off regularly for eating throughout the day. It does feel pretty thin. I‚Äôm not about to dump a pitcher of water into it to show you a ‚Äúsneeze‚Äù but I feel like it‚Äôs protective enough for quick trips.<br />Would recommend to family/friends: I would recommend this for short-term use like trips to a grocery store or to visit a family member/friend. Long term use for a day or more than a few hours, they did not and do not hold up well."
4.0,"I wore this dress for a party, everyone complimented my dress! I don‚Äôt give a five starts review because the seam on the back was broken, I didn‚Äôt realized about it after I was at the party"
4.0,"This dress was the hit of the NYE party I want to. Everyone couldn‚Äôt believe I bought it on Amazon Prime! It was perfect for the occasion at a great price. The sparkles and lower back (not too low that you can‚Äôt wear a bra!) were fun and flattering. Only negative is that the sizing runs very small and I did shed a couple sequins throughout the night, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. I am 5‚Äô 4‚Äù, 195 lbs, 36DDD and the size 18 just fit with the help of some shapewear. Definitely order one size up! It is a shorter dress but it was okay since I‚Äôm pretty short too."
4.0,"Nice material, cute design."
4.0,"I'm a 33"" waist and the Mediums were HUGE on me.  Perhaps I got a mislabeled one?<br /><br />I got another pair and still huge.  I‚Äôm a 33‚Äù waist and smalls fit perfect.  Great features but sizing was waaaaaaay off"
4.0,"I don't exactly have skinny arms but they aren't big either, and these would only go half way up.<br />They still get a 4 star though. The design, the material, the quality, is all top notch. I can easily modify them for my costume and nobody will be any wiser."
4.0,So cute i got a neglace extension to make it as log as I wanted but I like it after a while the necklace turned badly i kept the charm and earrings tho
4.0,Bought this as the gift for my former colleague. The size is very suitable for the back pocket of trousers. Not too fancy.
4.0,They were just what we were looking for. 2 out of the 80 were missing the eyelet rings for attachment. 1 brass and 1 silver not bad for a bunch of charms. Still a great deal.
4.0,Cute shoe. Thought it was matte black from the picture though.
4.0,I liked it but the M felt like a small so I had to get a L but it‚Äôs really nice
4.0,"Very cute but not the best quality- but not horrible considering the price. After my daughter wore it once there was fraying in the lace part. It was like plastic fibers that were coming out of the lace.<br />After washing it frayed some more but I just snipped the plastic fiber things away. Probably won‚Äôt hold up that well, but it is super cute<br />It also runs very small would order up! Daughter wears a 24 month-2t and the XS (2T) was very snug in the belly and pants were like capris."
4.0,"I like the design on these t-shirts so I bought a couple.  The first go around I bought an XL as that is my size for a bit of a looser fit in T-shirts.  This brand runs a big small and being 100% cotton it is going to shrink!  So I returned it for a XXL and it was really too big, I will keep it as I like this design but I will try to shrink it in the wash.  It is your basic unisex t-shirt with a crew neck.  I'd prefer a v-neck if the design came in the style."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, well made dress. My husband did not like it on me."
4.0,Loved them just wish they had at least one loop for tying
4.0,Very cute on. It does shrink when washed.
4.0,Do NOT buy these unless you have used the Sof Sole arch measuring plate in a store. You won't have any idea of the correct amount of support or arch height you need.<br /><br /> I would suggest that anyone in need of some orthotic support give these a try after determining the model you need in store. Absolute life savers. Asking price is $40 but I got these for less than $28. I think they are actually &#34;fixing&#34; my arches. I had a pair of the low arch models (the blue ones) and went to get a pair at Cabelas. I decided to step on their Soft Sole arch measuring plate. This time it indicated that I needed the neutral supports (green ones). The arches are higher in these by a couple mm.
4.0,Great sweatshirt except is runs very small! I read previous reviews and new it ran small so I ordered a large accordingly because I wanted a big loose sweatshirt (I usually wear a small) and it's only slightly big! I felt like it ran off of kid sizes. I'm just glad I sized up in the first place.
4.0,Not sure why but the metal irritated my son‚Äôs finger. Bummer
4.0,"Love the look of this skirt, a bit disappointed in the zipper breaking after only one use. Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for that. Luckily, I have the sewing skills to replace it for a better quality zipper, but it is definitely something to keep in mind for future buyers."
4.0,A little short in lengh
4.0,I get lots of compliments on it every time I wear it
4.0,"Like top, however rather big."
4.0,"I COULDN'T FASTEN THE SMALL CLASP.  I MADE IT WORK BY ATTACHING A &#34;CHAIN EXTENSION&#34; THAT HAS A NORMAL SIZE CLASP, SO NOW I CAN FASTEN & UNFASTEN BETTER.<br />REALLY DO LOVE THE COLOR & STYLE."
4.0,"Really liked this dress.  It's just the style I like. I could have probably gotten a size smaller, but I bought it last min for an event so I couldn't exchange. One piece of advice if you have any gut make sure to wear a good pair of spanx or something similar, cause it will show"
4.0,Bought these a Christmas gift for my granddaughter - she thought they were beautiful.
4.0,"This is a super cute dress. Perfect for a night out with the girls! Quality isn't astounding, but it's not horrific either. I'd purchase again. I ordered a XL because the size runs small."
4.0,"Overall good quality and perfect for cosplay. Comes in a cute box, keys and key rings have good weight to them and it comes with a bonus Grey‚Äôs necklace. I have 2 major complaints that are honestly forgivable: the set is missing one of Lucy‚Äôs silver keys (Pyxis) and two of Yukino‚Äôs silver keys (Polaris and Deneb). The other complaint is the set only came with 11 total key rings to fit 24 keys so that‚Äôs kind of a bummer. The last bit is more just confusion on my end, it comes with 3 repeat golden keys in slightly different styles: Aries, Pisces, and Gemini?, as well as one I don‚Äôt recognize at all from the manga or show. Overall a good buy, and worth your money for both display and cosplay, package was in great condition and arrived far more quickly than promised."
4.0,gift for musically inclined daughter
4.0,Good fit for my daughters small wrist; however it is adjustable. Sturdy decorative material but the lock piece could be more sturdy. Handle with care.
4.0,"Like the size.  Wish the leather looked a little more supple, kinda looks cheapy.  But all in all I like the bag."
4.0,"This is a super cute bikini , material is good and thick enough . I am 5‚Äô4 and 140 pounds . I have 36D chest , 29 waist and 43 inch hips . The bottoms fit well..  I Like to kind of stretch them out just slightly so they sit smoothly on my hips , high cut , thong like , and the top was a tad small for my liking but fit fine . I would say order up a size ! So I think a xl for my boobs would of been better , deff will want that little extra material."
4.0,"The quality of the case is worth the price alone.  These googles do exactly what I want; lot's of peripheral and clear for night workouts.  The strap is a little old school so I run it tighter than my tinted Phelps googles (day workouts, yeah).  When I say old school, I mean there is a flapping end of the strap with a ratchet system.  I can feel the flapping while swimming and I don't love it, but good googles none the less."
4.0,"It is actually very pretty. I was nervous about ordering a medium. I'm 5'1&#34; 120 lbs I'm a size 5 jeans and I have big breast to be so tiny. I did end up taking the cups out so it's a little more comfortable. I have a bit of a side boob, but in all it's pretty I love it"
4.0,"I have several inexpensive skater dresses, all of which I adore- but this the least.<br />It's still a good dress, but there's a few things to look out for. This dress runs a bit small in the chest, and I'm a 34B, and normally wear a small/4-6 in dresses. The fabric is pretty stretchy, to help make up for this, but it distorts the pattern some. I'm somewhat tall at 5'9&#34;, and the length is perfect.<br /><br />I purchased this in the black/cherry blossom. The pattern looks a bit too cartoony for a floral for my tastes, so I'd recommend a pattern that's more purposefully whacky. I dig the Cthulhu pattern, and definitely hope more options come available."
4.0,"Arrived as promised, appropriately packaged.  This was my second purchase...first purchase was to check for fit as two previous, different brands were horrible fits--one pair took me 30 min to put on--yes, I'm THAT dumb about a new purchase.  SO I purchased 3 different brands. My problem is I have short, heavy calves, and fairly small feet and ankles.  Swelling after heart surgery was uncomfortable, to say the least.  These socks are very comfortable, a good fit, even if I'm a bit swollen.  They are the easiest of the three brands to put on, and the only ones I've kept.  I know they aren't snag- or run-proof, but I've not had a problem yet.  These are like a pair of tights--maybe a bit heavier.  They stay up all day...Well, I'm retired, they stay up MY &#34;all day&#34;.  Sturdy, good fit, fair price...I wish they came in lots of colors--if I HAVE to wear the darn things, I prefer lots of colors...pastels, brights, neons...I'm retired, not tasteless...or boring....Give me a choice, please!"
4.0,"Overall I am very happy with this pullover. Its fabric is nice and lite and seems like it should be very durable. I ordered a large even though I am more like a medium according to the table; the way it fits, though, I'd say it probably runs a little bit small. I like a baggier look, but in reality, this is a closer fit than that.<br /><br />My only concern is that this item is billed as a ""V-Neck-Sweater."" Maybe this is a matter of opinion, however, I would not call this a sweater at all; it is more like a pullover or shirt. The fact that it has a ""knit"" collar put a certain idea in my mind about what this would be...but that was not correct. It isn't made out of sweater material, in my opinion, and for that reason, I am taking away a star. Having said that, I definitely do like this and will wear it frequently!"
4.0,"Light, comfy, and oh, so visible. My wife wears it to jog on our country road. But the shoulder seems are coming undone...maybe I'll superglue them."
4.0,"Beautiful little bangle, I'm very skinny and really struggled to get it on my wrist and worry it might break. Got lots of compliments though! Comfy too and cheap."
4.0,Bought these for my 3 and 5 year old to help in the kitchen. Even though these are kids size the fingers were still long on both of them. Material sticks to its self on the inside too so it was tricky to get on the children who are not so good at getting gloves on.<br /><br />They did seem to be made of decent materials my kids were able to clean pumpkins and play in the mess and still have their hands clean and intact.<br /><br />Overall they are decent but will have to wait till kids are better coordinated to be able to use these easily. I'd suggest them more for 6 to 10 year olds then 3 to 5 year olds.
4.0,Only had them a few days. Check back to see how the wear.
4.0,"The beads are beautiful and I love it but, the what I call 'odd' beads are smaller than what I thought based on pictures I saw. Whiskey the eye bead was slightly larger. No other complaints. Totally recommend this to a friend!"
4.0,"Very nice shirt. Have not laundered yet. Depending on who makes it I am a 2XL to a 4XL. I could have purchased this shirt as a 2X, but never having purchased this brand before went for the 3X. Had I purchased the Pacific Legend brand (also great shirts) I would have needed a 4X. No two shirt makers are the same as far as sizing is concerned. I wish they would develop a 'standard' that everyone adhered to. In this case I am wearing it and perhaps as it is laundered it will shrink a little. Will probably buy another of this brand for Christmas (that is my wife will!). Comment on size refers to waist, chest, length and sleeve length.<br /><br />When I wear a 'car' shirt I usually get a lot of good comments. Too bad more are not offered, but that's a whole other subject."
4.0,I have an old pair of these that I‚Äôve outgrown & was hoping these would be exactly the same material but they aren‚Äôt. My old pair is a size 6 so I went up to an 8 & they are a little looser than I like. They are comfortable & a softer material so I am going to keep them. Just wished they held my ‚Äòstuff‚Äô in tighter so nothing jiggles or moves while working out.
4.0,daily kick around (retired)  comfy slipper that is good for outdoors - came way too small so modified them to be<br />usefull  hahaha
4.0,"pretty ring, not as sparkly as the picture but ok costume jewlery"
4.0,"I am very happy with this product after I made one quick adjustment and came up with an idea that keeps the window clear.  As a speech language pathologist, I needed a tight fitting mask that allows children to clearly see my mouth movements and provides me with a large range of lip movements.  The mask, in its original form, was flush against my face.<br />Therefore, my lips often touched the window when I produced lip rounding sounds (which was very awkward).  To resolve this, I hand sewed the bottom of the mask so that it stays rounded. This took about 2 minutes.  Then, when I am going to wear it during a treatment session, I add a tiny bit of shaving cream to the window and gently wipe it with a soft tissue until it is clear.  This keeps the window from fogging up.  Works like a charm. Best of all, the children are even more aware of how sounds are produced as the mask frames my mouth."
4.0,Bought these for big mama and she loved them. They are a bit heavy so hang a little strange from the lobes but still very happy.
4.0,Very cute and well made for an inexpensive bracelet.
4.0,"I LOVE this bikini, such a cute style and felt like a wonderful material but I should have listened and ordered UP UP! I ordered a medium which is typical for me, I should have gone with a large or possibly an XL! Unfortunately I refused to admit it until too late and I ended up donating it."
4.0,"Everything about them are great. Material, color, quality & fit.<br />Will be purchasing more."
4.0,Ideal para cambiar y combinar los outfit de oficina
4.0,"Wasn't happy with quality of shoes, company made it right."
4.0,"Very nice! I ordered the earrings to match and absolutely love them. The only thing about the pendant is it's just a little bigger than I wanted, but still love it."
4.0,"This is very large even though I bought the correct size. It is also a bit on the heavy side and I did not like the shape.  It looks so nice on the model, but it didn't work out for my daughter."
4.0,Just ran a little small
4.0,"These socks are cute, seem well made and are of the thinner fabric we were looking for.  That said, wish they were a little bigger - worry about them shrinking over time."
4.0,"Great for the price. But somewhat tight to get on. However, that may be a good thing in the long run, because over time these types of stretch bracelets stretch out & eventually break and/or the band becomes noticeable within the silver. But some may find it impossible to get on if you have large hands. I think my hands are average size for a woman, but even for me it is the dickens to pull on. It is your typical silver pull on bracelet. (I do not believe it is sterling, just sterling overlay perhaps.) Also due to the tightness it is not the most comfortable (but not enough to keep me from wearing and enjoying, my wrist or average), but in time it will loosen a bit I would imagine. I would not purchase if you have large writs or hands, it will be too tight. The looks are pretty much as I expected & as it appears here."
4.0,I love this dress usually buttens never lay flat on my chest but the fabric allows perfect fit and stretch
4.0,very pretty just to small for me.
4.0,"This is a very warm shirt, but the collar seems a bit thick and comes out of the wash a bit unmanageable."
4.0,These are cute sandals and fit my wide-ish feet fine. They are comfortable for strappy sandals and decently made. The straps are faux leather and the closures at the ankles look like buckles but are fastened with a hook which I like as they are easier to fasten. They fit true to size. They look great with just about any casual summer outfit.
4.0,"so i just ordered this recently and so far its great, however i need to adjust it since its a bit big for my wrist (quite shocking because i have a large wrist circumference) . I do have one complaint, if you have an LG Urbane i recommend taking out the rods from the strap you previously used because the rods that were included are too short.  Other than it feels great and durable. I might go to a jeweler however to remove the metal section so i dont screw anything up. Once i start to wear it on a regular basis ill update this review."
4.0,love these and I wish they fit me. The seller is refunding me and I will donate them to the hospital.
4.0,"I haven't worn an actual Halloween costume in years. So I was really excited to be able to try this one out. I love it. Feels like it's a Little red riding hood costume. Comes with the dress, long black gloves, a pair of black panties, and the red cape.<br />The actual dress was nicely made. Has a tie in front to be able to tighten it a bit, like a corset. The back has a zipper. Plus the straps are also adjustable. It fit perfectly and looks great. The gloves fit great also. The panties are g strings and those were a little tight on me.<br />The long red cape is extremely thin and the hood was kind of oddly shaped but overall it's a great costume."
4.0,The picture in the middle is not in the middle is more to the side.
4.0,It has washed well and very nice to just throw on in a hurry to an event.
4.0,"Looks a bit cheap, but considering the price, it's good."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for love them even bought them in nude too
4.0,Fit is good. Pretty swimsuit. I love how unique it is. My only complaint is that it could have better coverage in the rear. Otherwise a fantastic swimsuit. Because it is designed to hold you in in the tummy is is really tight and a little difficult to put on and take off. Once on it fits and is comfortable to wear. I hope it holds up washing it. I will hand wash this.
4.0,"It looks great, very sturdy, and it was very easy to remove the links to adjust the size."
4.0,The scarf is thin so it is not hot to wear on stage or in the heat of summer.  We use it as part of our costumes in the patriotic performances of our chorus.  It washes well and is very colorful.
4.0,"For $30 I really can‚Äôt complain. The lace doesn‚Äôt look cheap and the length is very flattering. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù 170 lbs and wore a medium which looked okay but I could have definitely gone with a small since I am petite chested. The chest/shoulder area was a bit baggy on me but it was fine for the occasion I needed it for, and best of all... I didn‚Äôt have to go to the mall!"
4.0,"I'm no stranger to PattyBoutik and own quite a few tops but this is the first dress I've tried from there and I really like it!  I am 5'7&quot;, 135 and the Medium fits great!  The length is spot on, I can wear with flats or some heel and it doesn't drag but isn't too high either.  The only problem with the fit is it's larger in the bust area than I have bust to fill it, but this has always been the case for me and Patty clothes because I'm pretty small chested, but I own a few padded bras that I wear with them that fixes the problem for the most part so it's not a deal breaker.  In the pictures I'm just wearing a regular bra so you can see that there is a little extra fabric.  I'm also wearing a cardigan and a cami underneath (and a half slip because the white stripes aren't 100% opaque) but this dress can be worn in lots of different ways.  I think it's very well made and I'm so glad the fabric isn't super thin.  All in all I'm a fan!  Very glad I bought this and will likely buy more maxi dresses from Patty!  Hope this helps!"
4.0,"Well made, fast service."
4.0,The gemstone is a nice size and a good quality stone. It was well packed. I think the silver ‚Äúrope‚Äù could have been a little heavier looking and more well defined as a rope.
4.0,I received them today and I'm reallh glad they arent super thick but I wish they were a little taller on the leg. I wouldn't consider these sweater socks but they do keep my feet warm since I seem to have terrible circulation now days.
4.0,Like the color and the elastic pant bottom. Material doesn‚Äôt give as much as I would like but I‚Äôve lost weight since I purchased them so they are perfect now.
4.0,Very nice bright colors. Quick delivery.
4.0,This robe is VERY soft and perfect length. BUT...although it does come with a &#34;belt&#34;...there are NO belt loops. Leaving me confused and a little annoyed. I am sure that belt will disappear at first wash.
4.0,"I was able to try out this waist cincher and the one that does not have the arm loops. I like that this one helps smooth back fat, but found the area under my arm pits, near my bust line to get a bit irritated wearing this. It does a great job of smoothing, and I will wear it, but the other one is a bit more comfortable. Now, had I not had both versions of this to try, I would love this thing. As far as waist cinchers go, Fajas Colombianas Salome are on point. They are easy to fasten, once you plop down on the bed and get it started. They look great under clothing too. I love the zipper over the fasteners, it helps give a more seamless look with no fat poking out. It doesn't give you that weird &#34;she is wearing a trainer&#34; look in the belly like some do. It forces me to sit upright, which I love. I am very impressed with Fajas Colombiana Salome Waist Cinchers and have already recommended to my mom!<br />I was able to try out and keep this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />The last picture is showing me as ME, without the cincher on, to give you an idea of my mommy middle without it."
4.0,"The watch and was very nice it is also very soft, however not the company fault it doesn't fit the watch! My hub has a big Seiko & I thought sure the 22 would fit but just a hair too small! I wanted to cry, but I didn't. So I'm sending it back."
4.0,"We have big heads in our family, so it is a bit small for us but I like the hat."
4.0,"I like the fact that this bra comes with extenders because I definitely needed them because it seemed really small. Therefore, I recommend ordering a size up."
4.0,They are very nice however you can not clean and rewrite on them as easy as they make it sound. So much so that I feel that once you write on them that's it.
4.0,"I bought a small, and I absolutely love it. I have no idea what size dress I am but I'm 5'2 and it fits very well, other than the fact the front is cut WAYYY to low and it shows off a lot of cleavage, that I can easily fix with sewing. It's not pictured but the arms have an elastic band around the upper arm which supposed me but I'm starting to love the effect it gives."
4.0,"Nice dress, well done, good materials and very cute!"
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and weight about 140lbs  so I bought a medium. Good fit - not too tight and not too loose. Its a good buy for the price! There's not front or back of the dress so you can't go wrong when putting it on."
4.0,Shipped in large box containing (10) boxes of 50 pair.  8¬¢/glove beats most retail stores at 10¬¢/glove.
4.0,"I had high hopes for the black leggings, however, they are quite see through in the booty region. I bought the second picture grey option about two years ago that are only starting to become worn through in the booty area so I had hoped the same for the black.<br /><br />These are just as cute and just as comfy (size small- I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 135 lbs and athletic build) but are totally see through. Not only when you bend over can you see your crack, but the sweat marks are EXTREMELY apparent as well. Unlike the grey. Still love the grey!!"
4.0,"the material is not as soft as i expected it to be.. kinda stiff but fit the purpose i bought it for‚Äî be able to walk around the island, go order drinks from the bar and take pics with my bikini on.. fit was great with the right length and some room.. fir reference, i ordered a small im 5‚Äô1, 120 lbs, size 0-2 on clothes"
4.0,"My main reason for returning it is my own fault: I failed to notice it had a round collar when what I wanted was a pointed collar. In addition, it was not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù white. It had a slight pink tinge."
4.0,Very nice. It met all of my expectations!
4.0,"Can't yet speak on durability however its extremely comfortable so far and just as displayed in the photo. One of the issues i've had with these bracelets is I have a lot of hair on my hands and they'd get snagged in the bracelet and hurt like hell, it hasn't happened once with this product so far. The smallest size 7.5&#34; does fit slightly smaller than you might expect when it wraps however that's perfect for me since my wrist is small. If you're not slim or lanky i'd suggest ordering one size up."
4.0,Fit feat and looks good
4.0,I really like this necklace. I just wish the hearts were a little smaller. I have four hearts on mir and the largest one is the size of a quarter. The engraving looks great.
4.0,"It fits just right, in everyway"
4.0,"I love these pants, I bought them for office wear and felt they fit just a little snug for business wear. I like the pants so much I have ordered another pair the next size up to wear to the office."
4.0,I love the material it looks expensive and the looks it is very nice .. it could l have been perfect if I ordered size smaller than my regular size ..
4.0,Real cute but one of the earrings was not glued to the post. I reglued it and it is fine. Colors are great
4.0,Nice looking and not to big. I‚Äôm small and it‚Äôs hard finding pieces that are a good size. I highly recommend
4.0,"I had to return this dress. My sister thinks it looks like a Christmas tree, my daughter thinks it's too 'goddy'. I thought it looked like a Christmas gift wrapping paper"
4.0,Came on the an that's it it was a different color than I sent for an it was kinda big on me
4.0,Good product.  Great business.
4.0,"This is a simple bag, with clean lines and a reasonable price.  There are no outer pockets or inner dividers, but if you think of it as a tote bag with a style upgrade, you'll be happy with the roomy interior and the chic shape."
4.0,"My order came 10 days early...Ordered a medium and the size feels comfy enough although it's a little bit snug and the waistline is a little high. But for a price, I think it's great and even my grandma said it's a pretty dress. The colors are not as bright as I expected which i like it more. Will prolly order more of the other designs."
4.0,"ordered med 5'5""/115 lbs. Like my jamies loose but the top is too large. It's still perfect for lounging . Even tho I'm almost 70, practice yoga to keep good arm & leg definition ....these are a little shorts."
4.0,"Really pretty dress many compliments,  it fit a little big, dress has quite a bit of stretch so if your looking for a more fitted look order a size down. For reference I am 5"" 135lb 34b. But it is very comfortable"
4.0,I liked most of the charms but there were a few that were not to my taste.
4.0,"These leggings looked super short out of the box but putting them on they fit perfectly. They sit right above my ankle and I am about 5'4"". I ordered a small and I'm usually a size 2 in jeans. They compress everything nicely, the shading is very flattering, and they stay up throughout my entire workout. I didnt have to readjust them once they were on. The seamless front is also super nice, no more readjusting to avoid a front wedgie üòÇ"
4.0,"Lots of lint during drying - hope this doesn't continue, otherwise, robe will soon be too thin to retain warmth/"
4.0,This is a nice occasional cocktail ring. I like that you can adjust it to wear on any finger so you can look chic reaching for that martini darling!
4.0,Got as a gift for my father in law. He likes it
4.0,Cute and spacious red backpack. The top open zipper can be a bit difficult to open though.
4.0,I love the colors in this skirt and how soft it feels to the skin. I should have went up in size because they run a little small but I still wear it and love it.
4.0,"They are cute. Quality looks better in pictures. However, the earrings did not give me an allergic reaction, which is rare. So if you are looking for a minimilist pair of earings that are sensitive, they are great."
4.0,YOU CAN ACTUALLY WEAR THEM AN USE YOUR SMART PHONE AND OTHER TOUCH ITEMS
4.0,"Seems to fit a little loose, but very cute and well designed"
4.0,Shoulders are narrow
4.0,Really cute!  Exactly as shown.  Sizes do run big.  4 yr old wears 11.5 US.  Ordered these in 11.50 there is a good inch of grow room.  They are wide too.  Doubt the fabric upper will be that durable.  Well made with good padded soles .  Straps have plenty of holes for size adjustments .  Real buckles.  No velcro!  These shoes are just too cute not to have a pair or two !
4.0,very skin tight. Had to mix and match it with other tanks and shorts. Worn together feels like wearing one spandex outfit.<br />Very soft and comfortable fabric.
4.0,"I ordered the 14g taper but was sent what seems to be a 16g even though it's labeled as 14g. But it's great quality! Really solid. Even though it wasn't the right size, it did help me get the job done :)"
4.0,A gift to myself
4.0,"Good value, excellent design."
4.0,I didn't dislike because I wanted soft & comfortable
4.0,"Beautiful and realistic  necklace.  Unfortunately it was way too short for me.  But a lovely thin friend of mine was so happy when she received this for her birthday.  If only it were 4 inches longer, I would be wearing it right now.  So worth the small price."
4.0,"He comprado varios productos para mi reloj y este sin duda ha Sido el mejor, hasta el momento varios meses y todo ok"
4.0,Good deal. About what you‚Äôd expect
4.0,nice but the color is weird very yellowish
4.0,"I was only disappointed because of the fabric. It's not cotton, it's the stretch polyester, which is ok, but I prefer cotton on my kids so they don't get sweaty or overheat. Rather than return this I just bought another one that had the fabric listed."
4.0,Very comfortable and ideal for an around the house lounge bra
4.0,Best value you spend. Very well built.
4.0,"For a lemon lime bracelet, I think yellow should be the predominent color.  I bought it to go with a navy dress with lemons and a more yellow bracelet would match better."
4.0,Comfort is amazing and the support of great.
4.0,They come just a bit under the knee. Bought as a gift. If you have big calves these are NOT for you.
4.0,Lovely dress.  Fits well and made with nice comfortable slightly stretchy material that moves when you move or if you over eat :-) I will buy a few more. The only con is that I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and it stops at my ankle. I wish it was longer.
4.0,"This is a beautiful blouse! I do recommend you size up, because it runs a little short. I'm 5'9, 150, so it fits literally just right on me. It's fine for wearing to work, since I'm not usually moving too much; but I wouldn't wear it casually."
4.0,"Haven‚Äôt taken this out on a trail yet but size-wise the length is perfect. However, I wish it came in a 0 instead of 2 as the smallest size. If you synch the drawstring tight it won‚Äôt slide but then you have a bunchy waistline. The pockets a deep and the material feels light. Not sure it will actually cool me down though."
4.0,"I like the bra, but it is a bit tighter than I'd have liked. I normally wear a 38D, I think i should have gotten aa 40 instead. Other than that, it's well made, and keeps everything secure."
4.0,"I read the other reviews on buying two sizes up or so, and they were very correct! It runs pretty small. I got an extra large and it fit right.<br /><br />The material feels a tiny bit cheap but its a good quality for the price and everything comes packaged nicely, nothing needs to be fixed or worked on.<br />However, the zipper gets stuck easily, but it can be worked out really fast.<br /><br />The shoulders limit your arm movement a little but its not the worst thing either.<br />Works well for cosplay and im sure if you wanted it puffier you could get something underneath."
4.0,"Cute, but not great quality. Now on back was crooked, but my daughter has loved wearing it"
4.0,The outer transparent layer was longer than the dress by a very noticeable amount.
4.0,Color is same in picture
4.0,I absolutely love this watch. And a great price too. I recommend it. Tony Gaston.
4.0,"Nice shirt, but order 1 size larger than you usually wear"
4.0,"Arrived sooner than expected,my only complaint is that it came in a box labeled Sanjun,and the hands are different than pictured"
4.0,"This WOONIMA Mens Cotton Henley is unlike any other shirt in my wardrobe.<br /><br />The quality is high. For the price, the quality surprises me.  I believe it will impress you too.<br /><br />The texture of the shirt is what I find most appealing.  It feels great, you can see the texture and feel it, but the shirt remains quite comfortable.  The material is not particularly stretchy, but the shirt is oversized, so your regular size will likely be ok.<br /><br />The Navy Blue was a lovely shade.<br /><br />The sleeves are what was different for me, they are half-sleeves, which is an interesting style for summer.  I find it slightly more warm, but not too bad, and I appreciate the different look and almost upscale casual. Perfect for that summer adventure. Recommended."
4.0,Pay for what you get
4.0,I bought 3 of these for my wife her sister and mother and they really like them. For the price you can't go wrong.
4.0,I got the largest size possible for my body thinking of it were too big be fine. The short to do run a little smaller than normal. My waist is a 34 I got the 34 waist in pants and they were probably about an inch too small for me. They do fit because I do have a slight stretch their I just find them to be slightly snug. They're very appropriate and length nothing too revealing it all. Very well-made. I think these were in more to a smaller shaped but woman then ones of us that are a little on the thicker side. But if you can get the right size they will fit perfect.
4.0,This band is extremely cute and I got a lot of compliments on it but within a month all of the charms randomly unhooked and fell off. Still super cute and I honestly just bought more charms for it
4.0,Was pleased with the quality of the earrings.
4.0,"I love this jacket for the comfort and style. But the fit is odd on me. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúchesty gal‚Äù as they say so I ordered the XL. The body of the jacket is huge but the arms are short. The cuffs hit at my wrists so lifting my arms at all, the sleeves ride up. Otherwise I love this jacket. The interior lining is soft like a t-shirt."
4.0,"Very beautiful!!  I got them for my friend and I as spiritual friendship bracelets.  They are, however, very small. So be warned. Some of the stones also don‚Äôt look real; but maybe that‚Äôs just me"
4.0,It's  beautiful but it runs a the small size
4.0,"For the price they are great, esp you love blue. They are a little small but not too much. Easily noticeable w/o being tacky. I did have some problems in shipment, but the company was quick to fix it."
4.0,Great feel and very good quality. Ordered 2nd pair.
4.0,nice look good price
4.0,"Very nice skirt.  I wear size 10 and sometimes this kind of clothes don't fit right, but this skirt fits nicely.  Very pleased with it."
4.0,Honestly they were so freaking cute when I got them also the packaging was so adorable although I felt like the pause for a little hard and also they do run a little tight :)
4.0,Super cute. Can't wait for my daughter to wear it!!
4.0,"Not quite of the quality of some, but not junk. I wish the belt was mounted a bit higher on the bag, would make it more movable/comfortable."
4.0,"Could be a little longer. My wrist is 7 7/8"" in dia. they say ex long. It's very close for being extra long."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt realize they weren‚Äôt magnates when I bought these but they are pretty well made. They are a bit heavy bc they are very think.  The backs to the pins are huge though.
4.0,Came in and looks like the picture
4.0,Gift.  Well made!
4.0,"Adorable and soft, fits large (0-3 months fits more like 6 months) but cute overall. Will be fine as a costume if it's cold out its sure to keep my 2 month old warm."
4.0,"I've owned Somatic sunglasses in the past, so when I saw these I jumped at the opportunity to pick up another pair at a great cost. The glasses dont seem like they're as good of quality as my old pair and they are quite a bit smaller. So small in fact that I'll be pawning these off to a someone else, maybe a child. Oh well, still a good deal just not a fit for me. I also bought a pair of Somatic BISHOP glasses from the same seller....same size issue."
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings! They catch a lot of light, and as they move, you can definitely see streaks of orange and lime green darting about - it's lovely. However, I wish I had paid better attention to the size of the crystal square in relation to the lever back - these earrings are pretty small. I won't be purchasing other varieties, but I'll certainly keep the &#34;Volcano&#34; pair I bought!"
4.0,"Appears to be a sturdy product but has only four sleeves for photos, cards, etc. Other products have had six sleeves. Otherwise, seems well made."
4.0,great suit for the price!
4.0,"This is a fitted style dress - similar to a fit and flare style, but perhaps not quite as forgiving around the middle as some fit and flare due to it having a longer top part/longer waist. It flares at the hips, not the waist, so could show a bit of belly.<br />The black is therefore a good colour for me."
4.0,"Nice jacket, good fabric, not too heavy, only one bad thing: orange on the inside (nothing to worry if you like orange)"
4.0,Very pretty. Grand baby
4.0,Love this shirt! Only thing I'd change is the location of the patches. Once I remove them and place them better this will be perfect!
4.0,The material is a bit thin but I look great in these pants.
4.0,"Need very dark rotation for light sensitivity, and these are helping."
4.0,"This is really cute for Halloween. i got the purple tank top dress with black bats and skulls on it.<br />I bought a small (I am 5‚Äò5‚Äú and weigh 122, hourglass figure.) and<br />It was a little bit big in the arm holes (but doable) and a little bit longer than I expected but I am keeping it."
4.0,"Just a little bigger than I would have thought, but good quality, and my daughter put little capri leggings and it was adoreable. Shorts might have been a bit hidden below the length, but it will last for a while!"
4.0,Feels in between a bathing suit and a cotton bra. Has a bathing suit style hook. Looks like the picture and quality is good
4.0,These are great! I get compliments on them every time I wear them. Highly recommend!
4.0,"Perfect dress fot a date night or night out. Very sexy, my husband was very pleased, if you know what I mean"
4.0,I was able th d shorten a little and like way way it looks use it very day.good very good.
4.0,"Quality is good but the cooler is too dark, not as bright as shown in pictures. I returned it."
4.0,The gold looks real
4.0,This dress is so cute and soft but the bodice and arms are very form fitting. Tighter than I expected. I wear sm to med and I purchased a med but got the too small feel.
4.0,Good fit and goes well with the right sneakers
4.0,"After waiting for a longer than normal delivery, I must say I was surprised.  They are prefectly acceptable pins for my girls that will be visiting Disneyland and trading pins for the first time.  Some pins were repeated and one I can't recognize but has the Disney logo on the back...I'm sure will be the first to be traded."
4.0,Didn't know my size so I did this test I read about how to figure it out. well I was wrong and a little too small. My fault but still like the ring.
4.0,"Love it, it is however smaller than expected.  They are from China so definitely go up a size larger than you wear.  Took a little time getting here, however coming from overseas, I guess that is to be expected."
4.0,Good color on design
4.0,Liked the look but were a little smaller than picture.
4.0,"Pretty top, but Way2small!!! Only way I could wear this was as a head wrap- so had to give it away.üò¢"
4.0,Really cool looking. Love the look. I had to cut a little bit to size it to my arm. And the sides frayed I finally got it back In the clamp. And now feels better.
4.0,"Like the colors, cute"
4.0,"When they say 170 cm (5'7""), they mean it.  Too bad - they seem well made.  So if you're over 5'6"", pass these by."
4.0,"OK, gave to grandson as gift, says it's cool"
4.0,"Fear of it shrinking I had to return this top as I ordered it in a medium (my usual size) and it was a little to tight around the chest and not as long as I thought it would be. I felt the sleeves were also to short. So I took a chance and sent it back and reordered it in a large, which fit better. I'm 5'6"" 37 bust and 148 lbs.  I'm not truly happy with the length, I also wish it was longer and the material could be a little thicker, somewhat light weight for a sweatshirt. But overall the large does fit better, I will definitely need to layer something underneath it. The colors are bold and vibrant. I probably won't dry it in the dryer for fear it might shrink!! Definitely order up when ordering !!"
4.0,"Pockets are small, can't hold a large cell phone. Or keys."
4.0,"Other than being very thin, almost see-through, they fit & look great"
4.0,Loved the swimsuit it looked beautiful can't wait to test it out.
4.0,"I purchased this sweatshirt for myself (I am a woman; 5'2&#34; and about 125lbs (with a 5% margin of error on either side ;) ).  Regardless, if I buy men's sweatshirts, I'm typically a small (larger if I purchase women's clothes).  I purchased a small and it fits pretty well, though maybe slightly more snug than usual. I think that maybe a medium may have been a 'slightly' better fit.  The quality of the sweatshirt seems to be good and the material keeps me warm. I went for a small hike today, and it kept me warm enough.  The black is sharp and crisp and I like the way it looks on me.  It is slightly longer -but this was expected as usually men's hoodies are a little bit.  I would definitely recommend this product overall."
4.0,Nice casual earrings. Quality is decent. They serve their purpose.
4.0,These are decent shirts for little boys.  I bought them because I like the mix of patterns and solids.  My only complaint is that I wish they washed better and did not wrinkle so badly.  The hunter green shirt has already faded quite a bit after five washes and I do have to steam them to get the wrinkles out which is annoying for a kids shirt.  Overall though I would purchase again.
4.0,"Got this for the kids to give to my wife. It's certainly not the high quality gold necklace you would find in a store, but it is gold plated and should wear well for a time. The pendant is beautiful and the crystal shines brightly. It doesn't look cheap. Makes a great gift."
4.0,Feels very thin like swim suit material.<br />So if ua have a baby bucket or a roll or 2. They will<br />be in perfect view in this.
4.0,"Love these!!! I purchased 3 more but the long ones because the Capri wasn‚Äôt in stock or not many to choose from but I ordered more just because I like the design and material and it‚Äôs super comfy and I get compliments asking where I got them lol  only problem was some thread was already loosening up on the butt crotch area, I can see the colored thread, so not sure how long it‚Äôll last before unraveling"
4.0,I wore this to a family friends 60th birthday party.  I was a little disappointed when I opened the package.  The stitching and the fabric made it look a little cheap but ince I tried it on........WOW! it fit so well and looked so good on.  the shorts fit well and the slit in the leg was just enough spice.  I certainly got value for my money.
4.0,"Website recommended 1x, I ordered 2x, and should have ordered 3x.  The prints are beautiful,  but the arms are too tight, and it is shorter than expected, and too snug on my chest.  I'm keeping them to wear around the house, and to use as pajamas.  Very comfy, and pretty."
4.0,"thanks, good shirt"
4.0,"Overall it's not a bad piece. The metal is sturdy and the charm itself is made well. The ""glare"" on the left of the charm in the listing photo is not a glare from the photo being taken. It's actually on the photo inside the charm. There is literally a white spot on the photo. Part of the cross can't be seen so the photo now sort of resembles an apple?? I mean I know what it's supposed to be but it doesn't look that way at first glance. Overall it's ok for me. I gave 4 stars because it is nice. But would have been 5 stars if the actual image was what it said it was. A sacred heart. Thank you!"
4.0,Adds a touch of goth. They're a little over the top but in a good way. I've gotten skull glasses of another brand all they all broke pretty quickly. These seem sturdy so far. *update* 3 months and the gems lining the sides are loose in many places. :(
4.0,It is not touchscreen compatible as advertised. Otherwise it is pretty comfy and warm.
4.0,Nice scarf although it's a little thin...
4.0,The only reason it is four stars and not five is because the coffee color is way lighter than in the pic. It's more camel than anything. But the fit is amazing. The feels is perfect. It is so so super warm. The buttons are not well stitched on but it doesn't take a genius to fum some thread through some material to reinforce it. None of my buttons have fallen off yet knock on wood. I have worn it about ten times.
4.0,I love the way this looks on me...but it wrinkles very quickly so it's hard to just put it in a bag and expect it to come out looking fab.
4.0,"The body of this fits just fine, surprisingly because I have a long torso and can never fit in one piece bathing suits. I wish I had gone down a cup size because there is so little under bust support and I feel like my breast tissue shifts. I also can't get the straps to stop twisting on me, but this is the best option for my dress. I'll just use chicken cutlets and some garment tape to keep everything in place."
4.0,I like this shoe but it is not true to size when ordering this shoe you may want to go a size up....
4.0,"Bag is exactly as depicted, including the color of the canvas and bits of leather.  As it's a canvas bag, it's a bit 'floppy' when empty or if it doesn't contain something solid (laptop, tablet, etc).  The buckles are purely decorative, as there are four magnetic clasps that keep the main cover closed, but they are a nice aesthetic touch.<br /><br />Plenty of space inside, several small open pockets and zippered pockets of varying sizes inside.  I never use the zippers, so I can't speak to their ease or durability.<br /><br />It's a bit wider than I would have preferred, but overall a great bag and I've received several compliments on it's 'look'."
4.0,Great quAlity material
4.0,"As a fan of the Mortal Instruments series, I was so excited when I saw this. It came in the mail (and only took two weeks! Not bad for coming from overseas!) and I fell in love. The overall quality of it is great. There isn't any chipped paint or broken pieces. The only thing I would change about it is that the head and tail is very obviously glued to the main body. There is glue coming out of the holes where the head and tail were inserted. It's not super noticeable from afar but it's there. When I was comparing the picture of the bracelet on the Amazon website and my bracelet, I noticed that the head on mine had a tongue sticking out of the mouth, whereas the picture on the website did not. One other thing I noticed is that the product description says there is a magnet behind the head, allowing it to attach to itself. This was not the case with the bracelet I received. I don't view these as negative aspects, because the bracelet looks great and works well as it is, but I found it strange and felt the need to disclose. The bracelet is really one long piece of flexible metal, allowing you to wear it a number of ways. It looks great on my arm, but you could also wear it as a necklace if you're so inclined.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and would recommend it to any fan of the Mortal Instruments series!<br /><br />I received a discount on this amazing piece of jewelry in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed here are my own."
4.0,Very flattering good fit
4.0,"I ordered the &#34;navy&#34; colored dress in a small and while the color is lighter than navy, the dress fits really well. The material is nice and light. It's somewhat loose in the torso and flowy. I'm 5'4 and the bottom of the dress skims  the top of my feet so it's fairly long.<br />There are pockets as well. Overall I really like this dress. My only complaint is that the adjustment clasps are white and plastic and it makes the straps look kind of tacky."
4.0,"Although this suit fit as expected, I was looking for a suit with removable cups and this suit has molded permanent cups. I sent it back"
4.0,"Nice top , but the 3x fits almost like a 4x . Be"
4.0,Very cute flashing Santa‚Äôs.  Some of them didn‚Äôt work.  But most fid
4.0,"Love the dress and the style. So comfortable but again nothing is perfect. Felt like I definitely needed to wear a slip or something, since it was a bit sheer and the sleeve part was cute BUT couldn‚Äôt really raise my arms or else everything would show."
4.0,"True to fit, washes well and hung to dry. Pockets are a great addition. Great as a casual or formal addition to pants and/or leggings."
4.0,Came with a hole in the seam that needed fixed but the dress is beautiful and very flattering
4.0,A little bit small for me.. I'm a large size
4.0,"Gave these as a gift and was told that while smooth and silky, they were a little too small and that the elastic doesn‚Äôt stretch well. The colors are exactly as shown, though, and the price was just right for how many pairs you get! Order a size up!"
4.0,"Super cute. A bit large. Wish I had it in a smaller size.  A good buy, unless you have cats or dogs. Little claws will pull the fibers and make it look terrible. I have replaced it several times for that reason but the price is affordable"
4.0,"This ring is very pretty but for a person with small hands, the settings are a bit big. They are constantly rubbing on my fingers on either side.  I'm keeping it but will probably only wear it for short periods of time.  The price was right though!"
4.0,"It is a beautiful hat took like 3 weeks to arrive and the packaging is horrible it came smashed up in a bag but when I opened it it popped right back , love it."
4.0,"I like the Epoch brand. Seems to be well made and the fit is accurate. Not to thrilled that it came in a bubble bag stuffed in my mailbox, which left a wrinkle or two in the brim. Hopefully they'll come out in time."
4.0,Pleasant feel on the foot and it is warm. A sturdy sock for a low cut sock.
4.0,"Hat is as described and I‚Äôm happy with its appearance, quality and fit. It is advertised as a Prime one day but it took an extra 4 days to arrive, with no reason, so keep that in mind if you need it in a hurry."
4.0,"Zipper doesn'tzip the  very good but,  I like the space inside."
4.0,Wish I would've known that's not a pocket.
4.0,It's very cute. Using it for a costume and it looks amazing with it. Just what I needed.
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty and elegant - I bought them in gold. They came in a cute box and felt like they were high quality.<br />However, for those who have several ear lobe piercings: these don't &#34;fit&#34; with other earrings, and even with holes further away they don't look good (I tried leaving a stud in my fourth hole; it fit, but didn't look nice until I removed all my other earrings). Therefore I recommend this only to those who have one hole on their lobes.<br />Unfortunately I needed to return because of this issue, but overall I had a good customer experience. Free returns make online shopping very easy, and that's why I would definitely recommend Humble Chic earrings."
4.0,These are nice and catch the sweat. They do slip a little bit much better than others I‚Äôve tried.
4.0,Runs about a size small but other than that it is an awesome shirt.  Especially if you love Halloween like we do. So cute I may order another!
4.0,"Bought these in black. They are very nice. Bought them in champagne. Matched my skin tone well, but the lenses are very light. Wanted brown ones, so I ordered them in coffee. They look just like my black ones, only the inside of the frame is grey, and the lenses are dark brown, not the frames.  Look fine, fit fine, but the difference in color is also a difference in the darknessof the lenses."
4.0,I purchased this dress for a holiday party at work. It's a simple design but very flattering to the figure. The velvet fabeic is beautiful and perfectly soft.
4.0,This runs small so order 1 size up.  Very comfortable dress and length is just below knee.
4.0,Order this in a larger size than you wear.
4.0,"These are pretty cute and reliable! They dont actually lift your butt, but theyre tight and will still make your butt look good regardless. They're not see through at all!! Very thick material. For reference, I'm usually around a size 8 to 10 in jeans and size medium fits well"
4.0,They fit perfectly. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù 145 lbs. they are not too long or too big. The only flaw is the zipper. It is flimsy but all else compensates for that.
4.0,Perfect gift for him! Very soft and really cozy. Feet will get sweaty wearing for long period.
4.0,Easy to find my car keys from purse.
4.0,The is great and feel good too
4.0,"Cute dress for the price, fits as expected"
4.0,I keep trying to buy these kind of dresses but they don‚Äôt look right on me. It‚Äôs very well made and pretty.
4.0,"For me, the material is not quite five star, only when compared to a Eulit brand or a DaLuca Perlon, which are clearly the best.  The length is perfect for my nearly 7‚Äù wrist mounted on a Samurai Save the ocean.  The buckle is thin, which I prefer.<br />I ordered 22mm black and received in a day and a half."
4.0,"Very comfortable, beautiful colors"
4.0,This dress fits well
4.0,Fits nicely. Gives my body shape. I‚Äôm an XL with a belly and this top was flattering.
4.0,looks great and I am very happy with it. just what I thought it was. now I need to add more ....
4.0,"It's great, my wife loves it!"
4.0,Functional serves the purpose related to those who are chronology aged.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift. We have one and it is fantastic. Took it to Disneyland empty, hooked to belt loop when it was folded up, when we needed to ditch sweatshirts they went right in the pack. Pack was used as a pillow for my son who needed a break. Lightweight, easy to use, straps are wide so they aren't digging in when carried, easy to pack into other bags/suitcases. Will continue to purchase as gifts since many friends have inquired about it when we use it."
4.0,Now I‚Äôll I need is my gauges and a vape pen and I‚Äôll be the best d bag you seen since fronzilla üòâ
4.0,Love love love these shoes. Fit well. I had an ankle injury from a year ago and heels normally hurt when I wear them but it doesn‚Äôt with this shoe. Very comfortable and easy to walk in.
4.0,Nice fit but not the stretchy material I was hoping for.  It does fit true to size for me and is very soft.
4.0,"I liked several things about this jacket/coat, including how lightweight it was while still being warm and waterproof. The ""fill"" is not thick or heavy, but it does feel warm. Ultimately, it wasn't flattering to my hour-glass body shape and I returned it.  But if I had kept it, it would have been fine, too.  The quality seemed excellent!"
4.0,Perfect size and very nice looking. I bought them to replace a pair of bear earrings I lost. I was very pleased with them.
4.0,"Love the shirt and the design, reasonably durable.  But whatever you do, DO NOT PUT THE SHIRT IN THE DRYER.  I did that and the screen print got all melted together.  So when you wash the shirt, put it inside out in the washer, and then let it air dry.  Do not expose to lots of heat; the design will melt."
4.0,"Yeah it's pretty much a crop top.  You're going to look ridiculous if you are over 25 and wear this anywhere but inside your house.  That said, pair it with a crisp white button down underneath and it's passable.  It's well made, feminine and soft just super short."
4.0,Really love this outfit. I'm only 5'3 and wear size 18. Bought 3XL fits great but too long for me but I will get it hemed
4.0,Love it! The top is a little smaller than exptbut the bottom fits perfectly üòç
4.0,"Overall good wallet, only complaint would be that I damn near break my fingers trying to get my cards out of it. Hopefully will loosen with time."
4.0,Its a little shorter than i thought and a little tight. I ordered in a small im 5ft 115 lbs and a 24c for the ppl with boobies. I like it and will be wearing it its just a lil tight and a little short but i always wanted it as an undershirt
4.0,Beautiful. Good quality...nice size!
4.0,"Es reloj de agradable est√©tica, colores tenues y buena visibilidad. La garant√≠a de COSC es un valor agregado que hace que la inversi√≥n se encuentre asegurada. Adem√°s, el correa es sencilla y c√≥moda para una mu√±eca peque√±a o talla media.<br />Un problema que trae el reloj, tal vez solo sea el m√≠o, consiste en Que el segundero no se ajusta con exactitud en el dial, es decir, es las majo ellas no concuerdan exactamente en el libras del reloj, lo cual deja mucho que desear de un reloj que se precia de estar certificado por su exactitud.<br />No obstante, es una buena pieza por el precio y la garant√≠a del nombre tissot es un plus. El tama√±o es ideal y el color permite que sea un reloj para toda ocasi√≥n."
4.0,"Nice leather,  soft"
4.0,Slightly poor quality. But inexpensive. So good for the price
4.0,"Its super cute! Top half is see through like mentioned. My only issue was the arms were a little tight, so I felt restricted. I would keep it if the arms fit better. I bought a small and i'm a 4/6."
4.0,I'm very happy with this purchase. The fabric is thin as other reviews mentioned but it's great for layering.  I ordered the top in an XL because I was concerned the sleeves may be a tight fit but it has plenty of room. The fabric is soft and washes nicely.<br /><br />Looks great with leggings and a long sweater and its extremely comfortable.
4.0,Very pretty and they look great with different outfits.
4.0,I really wanted to give this vest a 5 star but there were some things that I think could have improved on. First I'll start with the things that I liked. The holder was able to fit my iPhone 13 Max Pro with a case pretty well. I think if it was an otterbox or something bulky then it would have a hard time. I like how secure it was and I didn't have the annoying feeling of my phone/keys tossing around while running or doing my work outs. I love how reflective the vest is. The vest overall feels secure so you don't have to worry about adjusting while doing your workouts. The plastic over the sleeve allows you to still do functions on the phone and the velcro which allows you to swing the phone up so you can see is pretty cool.<br /><br />Here are the things that I thought could've been worked on to make it better. To put on the vest is like putting on a shirt. You couldn't un-velcro or latch it so it may be more of a preference on my part. The little zipper on the strap to hold keys isn't big enough. Maybe a small key fob and a key but aside from that nothing really fits there. The other thing is the angle of which the phone will be when you flip it up will be right at your face so it may be counterproductive for that option.<br /><br />Overall I like how minimal it felt. It wasn't bulky. You can adjust to fit over a sweater/windbreaker if needed. I was pretty happy with the purchase though so if you like to run with your phone and don't have bulky keys to store then this is a safe bet. I've seen others that have more storage options but then you run into the problem of your items rattling when you run.
4.0,Cute dress and comfortable fit. Prone to static so had to use some dryer sheets to smooth it.
4.0,"This is a great beanie, warm, nicely made.  Somewhat small but it works!"
4.0,"Looks very cute on my watch, fits nice and comfortable"
4.0,These are small compared to other underwear that I've bought for my husband. The company did offer to refund a small portion.
4.0,"I like the glasses with the exception that I can see the screw attachments out of the corners of my eyes.  The amber color is pleasant and the frames do not slide down my nose.  I have not been using them very long, but I think the color and anti-glare coating is working for electronic devices.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"I noticed this switch opener is a little hit or miss on switches with an MX style four pin latch, but it does do the job okay.  I like having it though because it tends to work much better than my metal switch opener for the Kailh style latches.  Your needs may vary, but if you work on both types I'd recommend picking one of these up."
4.0,"Im 5&#34;5' 110lbs 32c and a small is just a little to big for me, I prefer tighter clothes, so a small would be perfect if you like it a little loose"
4.0,Loved it! Kept me so warm in the winter and it was super cute. Wish the material was stretchier though
4.0,"Beautiful. Lots of compliments. Fit is perfect, just not as soft as I had hoped, but for a polished yet cute look, I definitely would recommend."
4.0,"My favorite new shirts. I have in the white with black stripe, black and taupe (taupe-y lavender really) floral. I always get compliments. Great cut. Love them. Make more colors!"
4.0,***UPDATE***<br />I started to use these shorts for mountain biking and they do a great job. The other benefit is since they are a low cost option I worry less about wrecking and losing a pair of $50 shorts.<br />My original review is below and for road cycling where you are sitting for longer periods of times I stand by the review.<br /><br />Original<br />Overall it is a good fit and comfortable on a short ride on a road bike.<br /> Of all the shorts I have owned these are on the less comfortable side. After a short 25 minutes there is a lot of discomfort. Most of my higher quality shorts don't feel that bad for a few hours. I think the reason is the material they used for the pad. The pad on these shorts feels like soft foam. Higher quality shorts feel more like memory foam.<br />They seem well made but again doesn't take long to want better padding.
4.0,"It a buckle ,it worked"
4.0,"Got this for my backpacking trip! Splitting it with my husband. It fits perfect in the 65L bag. Large for my shirts, medium for my pants, small for my undies!"
4.0,Nice dress just didn't like bnb the sheer bottom.
4.0,"This belt makes you sweat! it worked great! I had sweat rolling down my back and my belly.  it is also smooth and seamless so you can wear it under your clothing and it flattens your tummy out while it helps reduce bloating. It was a tad hard to get on and off and because of that it sort of ripped some seams which was a bummer. overall, I liked this belt and continue to use it every time I go for a run or work out. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion."
4.0,"for the price it‚Äôs a really great costume necklace. i wear for my job because i work in a cheese shop! but it does turn copper quickly & the chain seems very fragile. other than that, i love this product for its simplicity & the exact design i was looking for!"
4.0,"Very cute, looks exactly as pictured. The fabric wrinkles easily and as a 5'2&#34; gal it is a little long on me."
4.0,Fringe wasn't as long as the pic but I still love this shirt
4.0,"I‚Äôll have to give this the true test of being worn on a typical day and see how it holds up, but so far, this ring is just as pictured. It‚Äôs delicate and looks more expensive than it is. If you needed a ring to pose as an engagement ring on a trip or to wear to work to appear taken, this would work perfectly."
4.0,"I recently ordered this Laptop bag, and it is beautiful. Unfortunately, the very day I first used it for class... the buckle broke on one of the straps and had to return it. Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy. That was a shame, as it's a great looking bag!"
4.0,great look for the holidays
4.0,"At first I thought these were not gonna fit right, but when I try them on it was a good fit and it is comfortable. I may buy another one."
4.0,A mi nieta le encantaron!
4.0,"Let me start by saying I love these socks. My son finds them comfortable, they have great stretch, the grips are amazing, they last a very long time.<br />BUT they reeeally need to rework their sizing.<br />I bought the 1-3 years size (black in the photo) when my son was about 18 months. They shrunk quite a bit but still fit him. They stretched well and held up great so here we are 2 years later finally buying new ones. None of the ones we bought 2 years ago got holes. Just decided it's finally time to size up.<br />Well, I got the 3-5 years (gray in the photo) and they look like they're going to be about the same size as the others once I wash them. Since the point was to get larger ones I'm going to return and buy the next size up from another seller.<br /><br />The photo is before washing (my other purchase shrunk a lot after wash), against a size 9 shoe."
4.0,"They are well put together --- but I think they might not last in the ""wild""."
4.0,Super fast shipping.  Accurate fit. Very soft and comfy. Deep pockets. A favorite in my wardrobe.
4.0,"I really like this dress, which I ordered to wear to a summer wedding. It felt wonderful in the heat, light and cool despite the black top. Only drawback was it was way too long for my 5'5 height.  Since I didn't have time to get it hemmed before the event, I had to hold the skirt up while walking. Afterward I had a good 3"" taken off and it's now perfect. Ended up costing me twice after paying for the alteration. Still worth it."
4.0,Only negative I can say is since it is 95% polyester and 5% spandex it feels a bit warm-but I love the dress. It comes to just above the knee.
4.0,good product. I wish they were longer.
4.0,As expected. For work.
4.0,"This is one of my go-to skirts! I dress modestly without anything above the knee showing, and this skirt is the PERFECT length for me. Now, I am only 5'3&#34;, so I can imagine it coming above the knee on someone taller, especially if your legs are longer.<br /><br />I have washed and worn it quite a few times now, so I can definitely attest to the fact that it holds up well and isn't flimsy. I ordered a large because, well, I'm a girl that likes to eat. I normally wear a 12 - 14, and it fits great! The only thing I deducted a star for is the fact that it has snaps, which literally NEVER stay snapped for me, especially the bottom one. As soon as I sit down, POP! A hook and eye clasp or buttons would have been better, in my opinion. But otherwise, this is a phenomenal skirt!"
4.0,Youngest son loved the costumefor Halloween! He loves to run around the hose in it being a pirate! Lost a star for the hat being WAY too small to wear!
4.0,"It is soo cute and stylish! I wore it with everything, but it left a really dark purple mark because of the metal (nothing got stained btw). the ring is pretty bulky, I ended up losing it... ;-; but while I had it was adorable and every one loved it!!!!"
4.0,"I like the product, but it was too small for my head. The sound quality was really good but as a 20 year old male with a larger head... haha It was a tight fit. So now I am just going to give it to my fiance and hopefully it fits on her head. I really wanted it to fit though..."
4.0,"There's not much fashionable about a rain poncho. It pretty much feels and looks like a giant garbage bag on you. I do appreciate having a pocket on the front of this poncho. It's only on one side, however, and can be difficult to locate sometimes amid all the fabric. The hood is not fitted very well and has a tendency to slide off unless you cinch it down around your face using the cord built in."
4.0,"It's a beautiful necklace, however I wish the pendant and the writing was bigger."
4.0,I like it. It's not quite as nice as a 100% silk shirt but it is light and has a good feel. I've only worn it twice. I'll post back in 6 months (end of summer) and update on how well it survives.
4.0,"Would have prefer a snap in the back not a tie in the side. I didnt realize it had a tie until I received it. It was somewhat hidden in the picture but, overall, I like the dress."
4.0,"It works just as it is suppose to, however you can defiantly tell the difference between the cheaper versions here on Amazon and the ones you would buy from a specific company directly...I ordered a corset from AngelCurves & everything from the material the product is made out of to the clasps & hooks are way better quality!  But if you can't afford to spend $60-$100 on waist trainer corsets, (which I'll admit is sort of pricey for what it is) then I would recommend you order one of these because it works just the same and is still pretty decent quality overall.."
4.0,The fit was a bit tight at the bust but was adjustable. I also ordered a size larger. It was used as a costume with wings ordered on Amazon. Very cute as a costume.
4.0,The dragonfruit color is definitely not what I expected. Honestly I‚Äôm disappointed by the color difference. I was expecting a really pretty deep pink/plum but instead received this bright hot pink. But I do love the other one. So I‚Äôm giving this product 4 stars simply because of the color difference between the ad and what you actually get.
4.0,"The feel and weight of the fabric is soft and comfortable.  However the side seams taper in and it is not flattering.  I shall probably have to take the seam out of the bottom 4&#34; on the sides and hem it with bias tape, to undo the tapered look."
4.0,"Huge fan of the octopus and the turtle, however, the flower is a bit oversized in comparison. I did buy mainly for the first two so I'm not concerned about the flower size, especially for the price."
4.0,Light weight and extremely comfortable. My only qualms with it is that it looks cheap and not really all that stylish. I thought that getting the snakeskin would offset that but it didn't. But it is my go to everyday sandal because of the comfort and support it provides.
4.0,screws come out easily like all the low end readers
4.0,"This is an elastic belt! For me, its more cosmetic than actually helping keep my pants up. Does look very nice."
4.0,"Coloring was lighter than expected in person, but still like and use it"
4.0,"For under 50 cents I wasn't expecting much. Surprisingly, the necklace seems to be holding up. Most likely it won't break unless it is pulled on really hard. The length is adjustable which is nice. Obviously these are not real pearls and I did not expect them to be at such a cheap price, but the finish on the beads seems to have been painted on. The beads smell like nail polish. Probably shouldn't get them around nail polish remover. Overall, good costume jewelry for the cost. The amount of shipping time may be detering, but my shipment came within a week instead of the 1 month that Amazon projects."
4.0,Somewhat small to my liking but my daughter was able to wear it so it was not wasted.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d1b5e8e35f3c48170eb089b1096f2046]] accurate description of a pretty well made product. red sandalwood and genuine leather most likely is not waterproof but has a nice natural aesthetic look. adjustable strap, batteries included."
4.0,Very comfortable and easy to place.
4.0,Pretty decent material & sewing. Better than the ones I got at motorcycle shop
4.0,I love it. The fit is great.
4.0,The arms/upper back was a wee tight which made it difficult to get out of. Will look wonderful with a hoop skirt or something to support it underneath.
4.0,"The pants fit nice.  I purchased a medium.  The label says Made in China.<br />There is a store close by that sells Level 99, all very expensive.  These were affordable on Amazon.  I will look at labels in the store near by to see where they are made."
4.0,Purchased 3 of these - for my mother-in-law and 2 sister-in-laws.  Added some ashes of my late husband and gave them to his family on the one-year anniversary of his passing.  Was able to put more ashes in than I thought - used a pair of tweezers to hold the urn and dipped it in the bag of ashes to fill.  They really liked the gift.
4.0,"I love them. Only complaint is that the feathers are very shiny, leaving the slippers feeling slippery."
4.0,Great storage for my cards
4.0,Nice dress. One of my straps was sewn  wrong but other than that it was perfect.
4.0,Nice looking shoelaces
4.0,"Nice quality, but the edges of the band need to be slightly &#34;eased&#34; for which I used #200 wet or dry silicon carbide sandpaper.  It did the trick.  Clasp works well, and it was easy (if you have the right tools) to make the band a bit smaller.  Worth the cost to me."
4.0,Just like the image. Very light not heavy on the ear lobes.
4.0,I bought a few of these bags and they are good for their price. One of then had a faulty bag strap though...
4.0,Better than what's furnished at work
4.0,Slightly larger than expected but very comfy!
4.0,These are so cute and are an amazing price! The only complaint I have is some of them started to come apart after r the first use. Other than that you can't beat the price and the amazing bright colors. Came when they said they were going to!
4.0,"This is a nice mini-purse - has lots of room, and is soft.  The only problem is the zipper is metal, and occasionally sticks then feels like the zipper will break."
4.0,Nice men ring... I love it... but it's bigger than my finger... I did give it away.. will order another one for my self!
4.0,"The credit card slots are a little loose,  the cards can fall out. But everything else was good."
4.0,"These are not snug enough for my liking.  I usually wear a size 9 or an xxl, so I ordered plus size.  I wish I had ordered the regular size. The fabric is very nice and soft and stretchable. They seem very well made."
4.0,These tops are great but run very small. I normally wear medium in tops and I ordered XXL based on what others said in their reviews and they were right.
4.0,This cover is exactly what I have been looking for for my K1.  I hope this reaches the ears of the folks who make this and they start making them for the K1.  The zip around makes them perfect for carrying my Kindle in a breifcase or pack without fear of the lttle things that are always present getting in to the cover.
4.0,"While I love this dress, I do wish that the seam was in the back instead of going down the front of the dress. Of course the polka dots don‚Äôt match up in the seam, I expected that because it‚Äôs an inexpensive dress. But it sure would be a lot less noticeable if the seam were in the back. I tried turning it around and wearing it backwards, but it‚Äôs a high-low hemline so it looks silly backwards.<br />All of this being said, it‚Äôs a really cute dress. Nice fabric. Fits well. I will get a lot of use out of it this summer. Runs true to size. I usually wear a 14, I ordered the XL."
4.0,"I am going to wear it to the event I bought it for, however, I have 2 teeny complaints. First, the points at the ends of the sleeves didn't match, one lays on the top of my hand, and the other lays across the palm of my hand. I don't know whether it was supposed to be like that or not, but it really bugs me. If my left sleeve is pointed across the top of my hand, I feel the right should be as well. Second, there was a fairly noticeable snag near the seam of the right side hip area. The crochet is a bit unraveled at the snag. It was more trouble than it was worth for me to try to exchange it before my event, and I didn't feel I would get it in time. Otherwise, I like the dress, it is very pretty, and fits perfectly."
4.0,I had no problem with these. I used it for my tragus piercing when I had oral surgery done. The retainer slipped right in.
4.0,"crisp cotton, makes a crunchy noise when moving, does the job."
4.0,"I am pretty happy with these glasses. I spend almost all of my day at the computer and my eyes were starting to strain after a long period and these have solved that. First of all I love how tight they fit, they stick to my face like glue and have yet to loosen even after weeks of use. I haven't noticed much difference in my vision either, they take a bit to get used to but after its almost as if I'm wearing nothing. My big problem is that the picture is pretty deceiving, first of all the image shows a tint kind of like they are sunglasses or transition glasses but they are not. Secondly its not all black, the front it black but the back of the glasses are light blue. Overall its a good pair of blue eye glasses but don't be deceived by the one image provided."
4.0,I like the ability to slide it on with out tying..very light weight..and fits just a little tight..but over all great for the price.
4.0,"My grandson loves sharks.  He was so excited to get this for Christmas.  I bought my grands these types of lunch bags a few years ago and they are wonderful.  They are very durable, washable, and great for keeping your lunch cool.  I love all the beautiful prints available now.  They do need more sports designs for boys."
4.0,"I got these in the mail last week and they came in perfect condition. I never realized I bought such big glasses. I'm wearing them for fashion and the first day I bought them, they were too small and they hurt my head. The second day, they didn't hurt anymore. They are a very pretty golden color and I really like them. The came earlier to Germany than it said they would and I don't regret spending the extra money for shipping."
4.0,"I think these hiking pants are great! The &#34;small&#34; size fits true to what the size chart states. Actually, they fit larger than I thought they would, based on the overall reviews. I had to take in the waist about 2 inches with a quick unprofessional sew job. Mediums would have fit me like clown pants! But the length of the pants, the nicely stretchy and seemingly durable material, and the trim--but definitely not tight--overall fit had me sold on attempting an alteration to the waist. They are made of a comfortably thin material, and I wear a base layer underneath for warmth. I can see wearing these most times of the year here in Denver.<br /><br />The belt is crap (but easily replaceable since these pants have belt loops) and the lining of all pockets is made from a kind of an unpleasant-feeling material (a nylon that snags on my dry fingers and nails) that seems like it could be a little delicate. The aesthetic design and functionality of the pockets are fine.<br /><br />For reference my usual pants waist size is 28-30 and inseam is 30-32; I am 5'10&#34;, 155 lbs., thin. If more smalls become available in other colors (my army greens look pretty awesome!) I'll surely order more and happily make waist alterations."
4.0,like it! ! nice material
4.0,Very nice for the price.  Wear it all the time!
4.0,a little short. a couple of inches longer would be good.
4.0,This costume is super cute- however wish it was one piece. The underlay falls down because there is no elastic to keep it over her bottom.
4.0,Super sexy dress! The price was deff worth it. I wear a 15/16 & ordered a xlarge. The arms are a little tight but overall I'm pleased . Deff a must have !
4.0,"I do like it, but the lining hangs a bit low in front, and I hate tugging at things in public."
4.0,It really was only a set of 4 clips.  2 of them were not clips.  But the 4 were nice.
4.0,Too expensive but pretty good.
4.0,"This sweater is flattering on, sized slightly larger than my usual experience with a size medium, but it isn‚Äôt readily obvious with the dropped shoulder style.  Where I noticed the excess fabric was in the underarm area; still, I‚Äôm not sure I would have wanted to size down to a small and lose the nice drape in the midriff area. I ordered the top in white but it actually looks more cream than white, in my opinion.  I held up a white envelope in the photo for comparison. The top went from washer to dryer to hanger beautifully, no wrinkles and no color fading or shrinking.  I like the easy-care fabric which also has a hint of spandex, 5%, which allows for a little bit of ‚Äúgive‚Äù in the top.  Seams are nicely sewn, and the fabric is smooth and not scratchy at all; very comfortable!  The top has a nice drape and looks like what you see in the model photo; the flirty little ruffle on the shoulders gives it a nice bit of interest.  The fabric, while maybe a slight bit thinner than a heavier cable knit that I was expecting, actually works better for my part of the country in winter.  I really like the sweater and it will definitely be in my rotation."
4.0,"Beautiful rose colored classy looking skirt. I'm 5'9 and it hits my knees... I'd like it to be a few inches longer, but otherwise it's beautiful and fits as expected."
4.0,"Nice ,simple and easy to put on . Very pretty silver earrings."
4.0,"I'm satisfied with them. I bought these for working outside in my yard. They are cheap and you get what you pay for. The reading part is a little too big but other than that, they're good for what I needed them for."
4.0,"Good camisole for the price! The added lace on the neck and bottom of the shirt adds a nice touch of femininity and is great for layering under tops or wearing by itself. The only thing I don't like is how thin the straps are, and even though I love the longer length, the cami is a tad bit longer than what I would've liked. Otherwise, it's great! I went by the manufacturer's sizing and it fits perfectly. The shipping was fast and the delivery came even before the earliest ETA date! I will definitely be ordering more to come."
4.0,Cute and inexpensive. Starting to pill a little but for the price I didn't expect it to last forever.
4.0,"I think the sizing is a bit tricky because it says it's for both women and girls. It's probably better if it's for women OR girls. As a woman in my 40s, with not very long legs (I have long torso), around 5 foot 4 and 125 pounds, with a 36 inch hip, this fits extremely snug... no room for more expansion. Any more stretching would probably tear this. Therefore, so far so good, it fits, barely, and I fear for its durability on someone like me. Maybe I am a much larger woman than most who will be wearing this.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's very comfortable and soft. The convertible foot hole is very nice and useful. I would highly recommend anyone smaller than I am to get this."
4.0,"At first I was hesitant with the mesh strap watch, but I appreciated that the watch remained still on my wrist and the metal was true to the rose gold color."
4.0,"mask is a tad bit too big, but if you adjust the bands yourself (pinned back or sewn back) it fits way better. sorry, no picture yet"
4.0,Nice quality skirt. Too long.
4.0,"A bit pricey for kids slippers, but the child I bought them for absolutely loved them, so it was well worth the cost."
4.0,The earrings were exactly as I expected and a fabulous value for the price!  I would recommend buying them!
4.0,"Purchased for a 80s themed party. It does feel a little thin and cheap, but I only needed it for one night. Works great. Worth the money."
4.0,Nice quality and stitching seems good. A little thinner than expected but for the price I'm not about to complain. Happy with the purchase
4.0,Exactly what i was expecting. Nothing falling apart or flimsy.
4.0,Really cute but I had to send back because it stunk and smelled like mothballs. I tried to wash it but the smell was simply to strong. My entire order had the same smell so likely the smell is Amazons fault.
4.0,"Just what I needed, so I could ware a necklace I hadn't pulled out in a while."
4.0,I just wish the birthstones were more visible as well as the names.
4.0,Shinier than expected.....but it does it's job.
4.0,Got this for my 7 month old to grow into. Perfect for what I need
4.0,My husband loves these slippers. He suffers from plantar fasciitis and these have really helped alleviate the pain. I was a little disappointed that there was not much of an arch but hubby loves them. They are very good quality and I believe they will last a long time.
4.0,I returned it because the face looked too large on my wrist. Otherwise it's a nice watch.
4.0,"The only disappointing thing is i noticed that the leather scratched, left a mark, not even sure how it happened. Luckily i ordered two in the same color by accident so i will now use the second band in replacement....<br />I do like the band enough to order more colors...so overall, i do like it a lot..."
4.0,"I really like the style of this old-school, geek-chic watch, especially the satin gold finish. However... it's basically child-sized and just looked ridiculous on my average-sized wrist.<br /><br />CASIO: Please make an adult version of this same watch and feel free to price it a few bucks higher! :)"
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. The owl is very cute and while she can't read the time yet (she's five), she enjoys opening up the wings to show others what time it is. There were two minor issues though which were easy to resolve.<br /><br />First, the chain broke. I don't believe this is because the chain is weak, I think my daughter is really rough. Plus she has a small neck so it hangs down very low. Secondly, the back of the owl that houses the battery fell off once while she was playing. Luckily, I was able to find it and with just a dab of super glue at the top, it snapped back in and never came back out. I can still remove it though if that's what I want to.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great purchase for my daughter who continues to wear it and show it off."
4.0,I love the necklace in fact i have ordered a nother one for a friend
4.0,"I like the length on this. It is VERY warm though, so if you like to feel a bit cool while sleeping, this isn't for you. I&#34;m waiting for those cold nights to wear this."
4.0,These dresses are beautiful but run small and they are short. You must put shirts under them. It took them 3 weeks to get to my house. Birthdays had already passed.
4.0,Have used these before
4.0,Very nice but smaller than I anticipated
4.0,"This dress is very different. It fits well and looks great, but fabric is a bit stiff and synthetic.<br /><br />The seam between the top and the skirt is very scratchy and irritated my skin. I took a star off for that.<br /><br />Visually this dress really stands out and I got nothing but compliments all day when I wore it"
4.0,"I wanted some yoga/workout pants that weren‚Äôt tight from waist to ankle, and these have a fairly wide bootcut leg so they work for what I want.<br /><br />The material is stretchy and fairly soft. They do feel comfortable on. The blue is a dark blue but not a exactly navy blue, which I was happy about as I didn‚Äôt want navy. There‚Äôs one medium-sized square type pocket on the back that wouldn‚Äôt be functional for anything but I suppose is for if you want them to look like they are made for more than working out, and a fairly good sized inner pocket at the front for your keys or something small. The waistband is wide, especially as they come up hight, right at my bellybutton, which I usually don‚Äôt like but these feel fine.<br /><br />The waistband for some weird reason has a thin piece of material at the top of the waistband (inside) and I can‚Äôt figure out why they‚Äôd put that there. It doesn‚Äôt really mess with the comfort, but it bugs me a little that it‚Äôs there.<br /><br />I ordered a small and they fit my 5‚Äô2‚Äù 118# body well‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want them super tight. The leg length is just to the floor if I‚Äôm barefooted and with my tennis  shoes they‚Äôd be off the floor completely. I‚Äôm not sure about the cutting the length directions as I am short‚Äîeven though my legs are relatively longer than my body‚Äîand they aren‚Äôt long on me, however, they don‚Äôt fit high up like the model shows.<br /><br />T I don‚Äôt know about tummy control part as I didn‚Äôt order them for that and it‚Äôs not a necessary thing for me, but I didn‚Äôt see anything inside the front to indicate that aspect. The crotch is sewn extra strong. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äòsee-through‚Äô so there‚Äôs not skin showing through as I do poses. They laundered well.<br /><br />I will say that they make my glutes look really great! So there‚Äôs that.<br /><br />I see these more as workout/yoga pants than ones to wear otherwise, but I could wear these to run errands, grocery store, or things like that and they‚Äôd do fine. They may could work for a super casual work environment.<br /><br />Comfortable enough. Hidden pocket. Nice color. Stretchy. Wide waistband but has that bit of a flaw with the thin inner piece of material/elastic. Overall, though, nice pants."
4.0,I ordered the Blossom color which is a very nice light but saturated pink. The wrap works comfortably for my 19lb 5month old. This is really just a long piece of fabric with easy to follow instructions of how to tie around yourself. I like that there are many options for ways to carry your baby. I do not like that it doesn't work for me if say I'm at the grocery store as I wouldn't want it to fall to the ground while wrapping myself in it. One bit of warning is to wait a while after feeding to use in the lotus/joey position! My daughter normally never spits up but this position cause a good one after a big meal!
4.0,Love them they were a hit for the event I had to go to.
4.0,the bracelets arrived in a very pretty gift box and arrived on time.  I love them
4.0,I love the way everything looks when viewed through the goggles. Very clear and easy to use. The case they come in is also very convenient
4.0,Nice summer time pj's.They fit but I would prefer slightly larger in size.
4.0,"This boot looks great & as if it cost a lot more than it did! I have had many compliments...even when in shoes stores displaying expensive boots!  I wear socks, so it is very comfortable and I don't feel any seams."
4.0,"The dress was exactly what I pictured. It fit perfectly and was flattering. The first time that I wore the dress, one of the red tie straps broke. Luckily I was at home.<br /><br />The only reason that I rated 4 stars is the customer service. They were prompt in responding and refunded my money quickly."
4.0,So cute but very see-through! I‚Äôm hoping if I wear panty hose under them it will fix that issue.
4.0,"Very cute dress! I am a petite lady and the fit around the waist and bust is perfect - as is the length. My only complaint is that the sleeves are big and puffy, which if (like me) you are narrow of arm and shoulders it looks like you're wearing shoulder pads (see pic). I had to get them taken in."
4.0,"Outfit is nice.  I ordered xtra small in warm red, and it did fit perfectly.  I am 5 foot 1 inches 113lbs.  However...I wasn't pleased with the color.  I was under the assumption the color was a deeper darker red as it looked online, the red shade was much brighter.  Otherwise nice dress."
4.0,Really love the color of this top
4.0,"Cute, but a bit smaller than anticipated."
4.0,The hats I bought were so cute! They have adjustments under the chin and behind the head that allow for growth! I have not used them in the sun yet but I have confidence that they will work wonderfully due to how well they are made.
4.0,Nice except they run small.
4.0,"The ""material"" used is like a thick vinyl, it does seem to be sturdy though. It's very well sewn and the zipper closes easily."
4.0,"I bought 4 different colors all on the same day because it's impossible to find these wrap-around watches in stores.  This one was by far the nicest looking bangle of the bunch, but I had to knock off a star because it's already starting to break, but just a tiny bit.  Still works and stays on, but it's time may be limited.  They don't last like a $80 watch, of course, but that would be a ridiculous expectation at this amazing price.  If it breaks, I'll buy another just like it if I can find it again."
4.0,"Nice product, easy to put on and comfortable. Very stylish."
4.0,Nice vest. Very cute and great material. But it runs super big. Bought a Sm for my size Med son. but can fit a size Lg man too.
4.0,Nice material and works well under a suit or cardigan.
4.0,"I know it's for silverware and flatware but I used this for final policing of pistol and rifle parts. Now, I can confirm that it does work for household items but it also works well for gun parts. I used a Dremel and Mother's Mag Wheel polish then finish with the policing cloth. It works like a charm."
4.0,"I'm not crazy about these, but my daughter LOVES them. They are veeeeery thin though."
4.0,These earings are great.
4.0,"A bit on the heavy side, but very cool."
4.0,"Look nice , well worth the money. Leather is dry, needs conditioning. They fit well thanks"
4.0,Nice key chain seems durable .  It‚Äôs larger than you<br />might expect
4.0,this ring is uniquely styled and beautiful.  the price is very reasonable.<br />thankyou
4.0,"Very true to the picture - it's a very fine chain and the leaf is both delicate and nicely made. I was a little concerned when I first tried to adjust it because it just wouldn't slide, then a tiny black rubber ring came out of the knob thingy and I was afraid it had broken. However, it now slides more easily but it still stays tight at whatever point to which I adjust it. So barring any future issues, at this point I like it."
4.0,"Finally a body pillow we can travel with. Both my boyfriend and I are side sleepers who use bodypillows and we love to travel! Most of our travels we stay in Air Bnbs so there isn't a front desk to call to get extra pillows. So it's always a scramble to find couch pillows, clothes stuffed in extra pillow cases and other such nonsense to create some semblance of a body pillow. Then I found this full size inflatable body pillow and it's perfect! I will say if you are very tall it will probably be more like a leg pillow but I'm 5'2"" and my boyfriend is 5'9"" and we both felt it was more than adequate.<br />It measures a little under 4' when it's inflated and about 12"" wide. For being an inflatable pillow it is very quiet (you don't feel like you're hugging a plastic bag full of air). It feels very durable and it held air for the 2 nights we had it inflated.<br />I wanted to give it 5 stars except for 2 things.  1. The inflate nozzle is almost impossible to manually blow up the pillow except for the last few breaths. It is flat and there isn't anything to get your lips around. The instructions say to use a blow dryer on a cool setting but most travel dryers or hair dryers you find in hotels do not have a cool setting. I did purchase a Therm-A-Rest mini battery operated pump which worked okay but because there isn't a nozzle to fit the end of the pump around it was a bit of a challenge. 2. I bought a regular body pillowcase and it is about 4"" too long and 2"" too wide. It isn't a big deal put if this came with an appropriate sized pillowcase it would be better.<br />Another plus is this easily folds up and fits back into its travel bag which I really love. Actually the travel bag is big enough that if the pillow had a more appropriately sized pillowcase I could roll them all up together which would be great for my minimal packing ethic!<br />Thank you BluMyMind for creating this pillow us and our backs thank you!"
4.0,I really like the strap very comfortable and effective. I should note that this strap does not fit on RAY BAN Wayfarer and sunglasses with similar type arms. This was not made clear in the ad.
4.0,"Fits well.  They do get dirty very easily so if you have a child that does alot of running around, maybe pick a dark color."
4.0,"I was so excited to get these shorts! They are great quality and are exactly as pictured, BUT run way too big, and I unfortunately had to return them! I am normally an XS (which is what I ordered) and they fit like a S, if not M."
4.0,"Love the ring. Super cute.  Delivery time was right on. Unfortunately, I've only had it for a week and the beautiful heart shaped opal stone fell off and is lost. The ring looks odd without it. Apparently a prong broken. I wouldn't mind a replacement though."
4.0,Looks better on display but fits well.
4.0,Arrived on time & great looking for the price.
4.0,"I recommend buying shirts where the necks fit.  That said, if you run into the situation where you bought shirts to be worn with the top button open and all-of-a-sudden you take a job that is professional dress and you realize that most of your collection of shirts is about 1/2 size small in the neck - these are perfect for you.  I used them on a handful of shirts as I was building up my professional wardrobe and they worked great.<br /><br />Most of the time, if you have a nice shirt and a nice tie the extenders will stay hidden.  If you have a shirt or tie that doesn't keep the knot in place, this makes the problem worse and you will be able to see the extenders.<br /><br />If your shirt is more than 1/2 size small - I don't think these will help."
4.0,Hugs nicely. Material is thin enough to stretch nicely but thick enough to be of quality and not cheap looking.
4.0,This was a very beautiful rose.  I was concerned about how the quality of the rose and packaging would turn out.  Pleasantly surprised.  I would buy from this seller again!
4.0,I use it for  daily wear.  The color I needed the most is the one that broke. color black.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of this shirt. The material is soft and thick (even a bit thicker than a t-shirt), and the cuffed sleeves gave it a slenderizing look."
4.0,Need to order 1 size up for this dress runs small
4.0,"It's soft, and ""cuddly"", and very warm!  A bit ""thicker"" than I imagined, but that's probably just me adapting to a ""winter"" robe."
4.0,"I bought this hat as a gift for my husband, he loves it, the style is cool and the fit is great. I'll say it: perfect for it the gay scene."
4.0,"I bought these because I needed some looser bottoms to wear while I am recovering from a nasty skin infection. I like that these are mostly cotton (which is what I was looking for). The quality is nice too. The pants aren't overly thick and not too thin. My main gripe is that the bottom of the pants are too loose around my ankles which makes the pants look a bit big. I am sure if I went down a size though I might have gotten the exact size I wanted. I ordered a Medium and am 5' 4"" 125 pounds. Otherwise these are nice and comfortable."
4.0,"Great shirt. Ordered 2 styles from Popfunk and they both came with vinyl stickers. Only thing I dislike is one shirt is Gildan brand, the other is Fruit of the loom."
4.0,This dress is cute and cool for warmer summer days.  It doesn't look like much on but it is comfortable and affordable.
4.0,Love them...bought them for my toddler a little too big so he can‚Äôt wear them yet but they are official Vans so let‚Äôs see how they hold up against a 2 year old.
4.0,I like the support but my feet did not stay warm wearing athletic shoes.
4.0,Cute kimono that is comfortable and fits well. I'm 5'4&#34; and 150 pounds and this kimono does not feel oversized. I would imagine it would be too big for those smaller than me though. This color (yellow) is bright and vibrant - perfect for summer and spring! I've worn this over white tank tops with jeans. One main drawback is that it must be hand washed - this is a big drawback for me as I am a busy mom of two young kids.<br />I would agree with other reviewers that this would be a good option for a beach coverup.
4.0,My wife liked the simplicity of the ring.
4.0,Seem comfortable but do need to be broken in
4.0,Fits different around the waist. But rather than that it is a nice shirt.
4.0,I don't believe it was an x large. But my granddaughter is a small an it fits her. That's y I gave 4 stars.
4.0,Product as described. Fits several pair of glasses.
4.0,I just LOVE the colors in this. I got the orange and would be reat for fall. This is a fabulous value for the price and also free shipping. It is shorter then most scarves like this but still will works.
4.0,"Great price, nice materials, but description on the website said it was supposed to have a ""carbon fiber look"" and the red leather is not embossed or stamped with any pattern at all."
4.0,"I do like the product. It helps with identifying my luggage quickly.  However,  now that my luggage has been damaged,  I can't get it off to put it on my new luggage."
4.0,Value for money; reasonable
4.0,very pretty but did arrive broken.  was not difficult to repair.
4.0,Does better than any other sneaker cleaner I have used in the past but not as well as advertised on some videos you see on YouTube works great on dirt mud but stains not so much.
4.0,"Very cute dress, appropriate for casual wear, work, or even a wedding with the right accessories. I'm 5'2 and 110lbs and the XS fit perfectly."
4.0,Really like the sweatshirt I just wish it was a little thicker or heavier.
4.0,Easy to adjust.  A little tricky to fasten the plastic buckle.  Good for casual wear but not robust enough for physical work.
4.0,My mom was happy with this product for Mother's Day.
4.0,"The band runs pretty large (I have to use the tightest hooks), but the cups seem about right and it works okay as a lounge bra. FTR, I purchased the 34F/G, and usually wear a UK 34G/US 34I. The cups stretch to accomodate my size, but only just."
4.0,"Out of the tassel earrings that I have seen, I think these are the cutest. I like that the tassel is smaller for each stack, which gives you 4 different colors instead of a solid or a double or triple color. These are your hand made fish hooks that are costume jewelry. They should be removed as soon as you have gotten back to your place and never spray them with cologne or perfume or deodorant. Don't bathe or shower in them either. Wipe the metal with a soft cloth afterwards."
4.0,"Love the size, color and suppleness of the leather. Only thing I would have liked more would be a little less &#34;flexible&#34; so it would stand better."
4.0,For the price is greatüòä
4.0,"The colour is vibrant in true. I'm pretty tall and it  Falls right at my ankles. For a curvy girl like me it does nothing for my shape, however the flowiness and ease make it a good choice. Super comfortable!<br />UPDATE: THIS IS NOT THE SAME DRESS! The shoulder straps are very wide and the V neck is really high. I will be returning for the item I ordered."
4.0,Shifts from time to time but overall quality comfort that's better than my seat. Has lasted over a month now and I use it 5/7 days per week. Wording has faded considerably but that's not an issue.
4.0,I like better the tiger eyes bracelete and the chinese green jade bracelets but i dislike  the istone handmade string because that is more like a bracelet for a little girl and i want it for myself to wear plus it took forever to arriveüôÑ
4.0,Very nice ring. It has purple color in the stone.
4.0,"bought these hoping they would work for a work shoe. The &#34;mesh&#34; is a little larger than expected plus the shoes are about 1 size larger that I expected. They are nice looking so will use them as garden shoes which I needed anyway. Tried them out in the yard and they worked just fine,"
4.0,"The sleeves were horrible when they came in and for a XL it is quite small for me, it is a beautiful dress and I wish I could wear it but it is a tad too short for me"
4.0,"These are thin, and I love the subtle Mickey print. My son will be able to wear them even in hot weather. They get dirty very easily though so be warned!"
4.0,"Fit was nice, not too baggy as with most aloha shirts.  I've washed it once and it seems to be in good shape after laundry and dryer."
4.0,The tail is fluffy but didn't want to stand out. It kept flopping over to the side. The ears were a bit small for an 11 year old and the eye brows under the ears weren't as fluffy as seen in the picture.  The color was nice and both pieces were well made.  As far as halloween costumes go - it worked just fine.
4.0,Bracelet as expected.
4.0,Para un üéÅ
4.0,They are gorgeous. A genuine eyecatcher.
4.0,The pink backs are very large. These are good for occasional.
4.0,"I bought this watch shortly after Christmas as a present to myself. It was on sale, sub $100 dollars. I wanted a black watch. Its a solid watch and keeps great time right out of the box. Its somewhat dressy looking, yet also somewhat sporty. Its relatively light and comfortable on the wrist, though I am no fan of leather bands. My only complaint is I wish it had more lume. The lume it has is good, but I just want more of it. I dont know that you could buy a better automatic watch for the price I paid."
4.0,Got it for my mom and she said she loves it
4.0,I originally ordered a 2XL based on most items that come from overseas fitting MUCH smaller than our US sizes. When it came I was swimming in it. However I liked the shirt so I ordered a second one this time opting for a Large which arrived and fits perfectly. So- that being said this shirt actually fits true to size for US sizes so consider that when ordering. Very cute top.
4.0,"Great for the price!!  Decent cotton fabric with a bit of stretch.  Had to have then shortened; they came 2&#34; below my knees I'm (5'10&#34;).  Wish they would make them 1-2&#34; shorter (like where they hit on the model in the photo.  Also wish they had these in a light gray, I'd buy a couple of more pairs.  Order one size up; I'm a 32 and got the 33; perfect fit at waist."
4.0,Blocks well the headlights at night. Clearer image.
4.0,**Update: my daughter loves these socks and picks them over other socks. Would buy again!<br /><br />Thinner than I was expecting.
4.0,I needed an attire for work.  It went well with my suede boots.  I bought for my business trip to Michigan I dont believe this will be warm enough but it's comfortable and nice enough for Georgia climate.
4.0,I love this but the pants could be a little more fitted.
4.0,"Yep, I'm overweight and was happy to find these wide-calf socks to keep me warm this winter."
4.0,"It was small around bust area if you‚Äôre bustier than normal than size up, daughter having birthday in 2 months will keep and give to her. Disappointed I couldn‚Äôt keep it"
4.0,"Pretty dress, but too small/ very tight in the chest."
4.0,"It does work very nicely, you just have to follow directions exactly as instructed. Any other way will mess your boots up or have them looking worse than before. Just be precise and take your time."
4.0,"Previously bought this skirt in blue denim and was so pleased, bought it in black.  4 stars because it doesn't have pockets."
4.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered one size up and was glad that I did.  Nice fitting and great material.  I would recommend."
4.0,"If your budget doesn‚Äôt extend to getting a pair of prescription readers, these are a pretty good substitute. I have tried many, many pairs and find that none of the mass-produced readers are very accurate when it comes to the magnification rating. I‚Äôve done side by side comparisons of +1.5 readers and found that none of them were the same from one pair to the other. These were pretty close to my prescription ones. Since I wanted them as an extra pair to keep next to the bed, they‚Äôre close enough. In terms of appearance, I like them a lot. They are light, rest easily on my nose, and are pretty unobtrusive in terms of the frame. Having a very light complexion and ice blue eyes, I find that heavy, dark frames or brightly colored frames look awful. These are subtle and blend well with my coloring. I‚Äôd give them 5 stars if they were truly +1.5 (they‚Äôre just a bit under). As I said, they‚Äôll do for the use I had planned for them."
4.0,just as marketed nice color nice fabric
4.0,cute but i think its going to look cuter on my daughter shape
4.0,"Really cute, I am 5'2"" and this dress is not too long (not dragging on the floor) comes about ankle length when not tied up. You can wear tied or untied. Material isn't super expensive but for the price it is fair.. comparable to something you would buy at like a Forever21. The jeresey knit material, as usual shows all your fat rolls - I just had a baby so I don't like that it shows every dimple, which is why it did not get 5 stars. Once I get back into shape this dress will be really cute."
4.0,"It looks really cool. It is the quality you'd expect for the price. I have some trouble where it will stop ticking even if it has been wound, but when I set it again and wind it, it returns to normal. It is hard to tell how much winding is the appropriate amount."
4.0,Bought these for my husband for Christmas.. he immediately went and put them on!  They are soft and comfortable and look great. Would buy again.
4.0,This dress fits like a dream.  It can be dressed up or dressed down.  It is quite heavy though.  It also turns my fingers black after extended wear time.
4.0,"Fit was Ok, however, the decorative buttons stick out a bit and can get cuaght on things."
4.0,"These are nice, but fit somewhat small. I also have large calves, so this should fit those with smaller calves."
4.0,"This 2005 double CD set covers much ground concerning singer/songwriter Iain Matthews.<br />Disc one covers Iain's albums released between 1990-2004 and these years contain much of his finest work.<br />&#34;Like Dominoes&#34; &#34;Timing&#34; &#34;I Drove&#34; &#34;God Looked Down&#34; &#34;Funk And Fire&#34; and &#34;The Other Shoe&#34; are only a few of the highlights featured here. There are 19 tracks total on disc one and upbeat rock music is right along side the ballads and it's a sample of so many songs recorded over this fourteen year span of musical gemstones. This is a big healthy portion of IM tunes. If you are unaware of Iain's vocal powers, you will discover what all the fuss is about right here<br /><br />The contents of disc two are extracted from two concerts from The Netherlands from October 2003 that contain the full album: &#34;If You Saw Thro' My Eyes&#34; that was originally released in 1971. Iain and band sound well-rehearsed and the sound mix is fantastic. The vocals are right upfront where they belong and the band is fully heard and this is more majestic that the original recording.<br /><br />The proof that IM is a wonderful live artist can be found here. Highlights from disc two are: &#34;Desert Wind&#34; &#34;Reno Nevada&#34; &#34;Southern Wind&#34; &#34;It Came Without Warning&#34; and &#34;Morgan The Pirate.&#34; The finale song &#34;If You Saw Thro' My Eyes&#34; was a duet with Sandy Denny back in 1971 and here Iain handles Ms. Denny's parts quite well. This second disc is a special treasure and  I feel lucky Iain captured these performances and shared them with us.<br /><br />This would be a fine starter collection for any listener wanting to hear some Iain Matthews music.<br />Four Stars!"
4.0,the color i love. the pants flexes. its a bit on the short side for my comfort. other ppl should have no problem cuz it fits right above the knees.
4.0,"Great bag. It is the perfect size for my needs; it can comfortably fit my 13&#34; laptop, a book or two, and my lunch. There are plenty of pockets to store smaller items safely. The quality of the canvas of the bag is on par with other messenger bags I've had. It looks quite nice and its size disqualifies it from falling into the realm of being considered a man purse.<br /><br />I do have two minor complaints, however. One issue is the clips on the front and on the side; the plastic cheapens the look of an otherwise impressive-looking bag. The other problem I have is with the crossbody strap. I typically like to make the strap a bit shorter to keep the bag at my hip, but like other adjustable-length straps, it comes by the next time you wear it and it requires readjustment. Of course, this is fixable with a bobby pin or something to keep it in place, but annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />Altogether, I am extremely pleased with this bag, and with the low price point, it is a great buy."
4.0,"I ordered the grey pair before these and they were a large.... But I ordered the same size on these and when I got them and tried them on, they fit like a medium. No kidding. But they still fit well. Other than that issue I love the color and they're super pretty."
4.0,Ran quite small. Would recommend getting 1 size up. Good quality though for such a reasonable price!
4.0,Good quality-- the zippers work great too! I wish it were just a little longer and had a few more card holder spots.
4.0,"Good color to it, not large but Lums are not large. Great buy for 2 bills."
4.0,I wear a small usually and I ordered a small.  The top fits perfectly.  It is a fun and unique swim top.  The bottoms are way too small.  I kept the top because I already have bikini swim bottoms that match.
4.0,Solidly built and well put together. The extra plates make it nice to pick your design that fits your taste.<br /><br />Only issue for me would it seems over long usage the corners might damage your pants.
4.0,True to size and comfort fit
4.0,"Small, but the dementions are listed. So I was not dispointed. Bought it for my boyfriend as a gift.  Wanted one for myself because the small size would be perfect for a ladies necklace."
4.0,I continue to be very impressed with these.  I have yet to see any other person wearing them either.  I have dropped them a few times and they have survived without a hiccup.  Not to mention the polarized lens' are awesome!  Highly recommend!
4.0,"Nice piece of kit.  I waxed this garment to increase both its wind resistance and water resistance.  The fabric took to wax very well.  My only negative is that the hood needs an adjustment mechanism.  Otherwise, good hood."
4.0,"You can tell this is cheaply made if you really stare at the stitching. I didn't expect Nordstrom quality. However, this kimono is soooo pretty and so easy to wear! I got so many compliments on it!  I ordered my normal size, Large, and it still fit me flowy! For reference to the photo, I am 5'3&#34; 135 lbs. Great Amazon buy! Another seller has this available with a mint base color and I have purchased that one and am currently waiting to see if it's the same quality."
4.0,I did not pay attention to the measurements when purchasing.  The bag is nicely constructed but way too small for my husband to use.  Will be giving it to my ten year old grand-daughter for whom it should be perfect.  Hope she likes green.
4.0,get them one size up or bigger and you will be fine or else when you put the on the material stretches and it looks really old and washed out faded.
4.0,"I bought this for a masquerade party. It fit great. I could still see quite well.  The detail on the mask is not perfect or extravagant, but it was simple and did the trick."
4.0,"Although I didn‚Äôt measure the actual length of the 2 ties I received, I did compare them to each other‚Äîthe blue one is a tad bit longer (by about an inch) & slightly wider than the purple one. Aside from that observation, the 2 ties appear to be made out of quality material, & are also constructed nicely.<br /><br />There is an Awesome 360 brand label on the underside of each tie which acts as an extra loop to help keep the other end centered behind it (I‚Äôm not familiar with the correct terms so my bad, y‚Äôall lol).<br /><br />The packaging is very minimalist. It‚Äôs pretty much a basic box with very little going on‚Äîit‚Äôs solid black, & there is an Awesome 360 brand label sticker in the middle (on the outside) of the box‚Äôs lid. There is a center divider inside the box which moves around pretty easily, but that‚Äôs not really that big of a deal.<br /><br />My review picture shows the ties photographed with & without flash to give a better idea of how the colors look in person. I was expecting more pastel-like colors, but they‚Äôre still spring time colors that can also be worn during the summer months.<br /><br />Unless the guy you‚Äôre tie shopping for is a tie-snob, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be happy with these (& you‚Äôll only have to worry about which colors/patterns to get for him!). If you‚Äôre tie shopping for yourself (& are not a tie-snob), or you‚Äôre tie-shopping for someone else, just take into consideration how the review photos compare to the listing photos when picking out your selection & hopefully everyone will be satisfied with the colors/patterns that are received."
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt as bendable as I was expecting. Once you‚Äôre able to bend it to fit your nose, it‚Äôs a nice, sturdy piece. I had to use pliers to make it fit. Looks adorable though, and hasn‚Äôt turned on me!"
4.0,"Looked good, a bit tricky to put on at first, then you get the hang of it, it was a bit on the small side though, other than that not bad"
4.0,Great cap. I usually sweay a lot and the netted back of this cap keeps it cool. I have 6 colors of this for mix and match wit color of pants and polos. Only nefative side is the size runs a little large
4.0,Great Colors
4.0,I received these pants for free so I could try them and write a review of my experience. I recognize that getting something for free inherently impacts your opinion so I try to be as constructively critical as possible.<br /><br />These pants are very well made. They are sturdy and the material feels like it is high quality. It is spandex and polyester though so they are hot! When I first put the leggings on there was a bunch of creaking and they were tight except for around the ankle where they bunched. However after wearing them for a bit everything worked into place. I got compliments from both my husband and my daughter which surprised me because my husband typically never notices clothes. But these make my butt look GOOD! High and tight üòâ They are also great for mommy tummies since they are higher and they stay in place (my athleta and lululemon yoga pants never do). Consider ordering up a size although they do seem to break in a bit to fit your usual size.<br /><br />I've worn and washed these several times and they've held up well except there is a tiny hole beginning in the crotch area. It's right at the Sean so it could easily be fixed. Currently they are selling for 12.99 and I believe the quality is much better than what you would typically expect for that price.
4.0,"These are really lovely ear pins, and, as far as I am concerned, good value for money. I am really curious about other reviewers who say the earring were so delicate that they broke on the first wearing. What exactly were they doing with these earrings? Yes, they are delicate and pretty, but unless you are using them as screwdrivers, you would have to try really hard to break them. All I do is out them into my ear piercing, position them so they lie against my ear lobe and squeeze them into place, if necessary. They stay put for the whole day.<br /><br />These are my third pair of earpins. I plan to start a collection."
4.0,I love this bag. I have been looking for something that can be used as a purse and also a diaper bag. The cross body is perfect when toting my daughter around because it leaves my hands free. I just throw everything I need into the middle compartment because it's huge and has a zipper to hold everything in place. The fabric is a canvas and very durable. The only reason I did not give 5 starts is because despite tightening the strap numerous times it always loosens after a few days and hands lower than I'd like. This is not a big deal though and totally worth the purchase
4.0,"The fit is the way it should be. This is softer support. It works for most blouses, dresses, with smooth lines."
4.0,"This is a very sexy cut bathing suit. It does require you to be proud of your body. If you have any issues that you want to cover, this suit will not cover them. I did adjust the center strap, closing it a little to show less cleavage. It is a nice quality fabric. It washed great and held its shape. The back is a Brazilian style cut, high on the butt cheeks. It has straps that tie at both the neck and the middle of the back. I liked the look best when it was tied tight. That's why I had the middle strap between my breast sewn together. It was very easy to do and it brought my cleavage in and made it fell like I was less on display. It also gave me more support. The sides of the suit are very cute, I like the way they lay across my hips. It's another feature that looks very sexy. This is a suit you would lay out in and sun bathe or go to party in. This is not a suit I can see going to the beach in or swimming laps in the pool. This is a great suit if you want to look sexy and get lots of looks. There will be many heads turning and many jealous looks from other ladies. The color I received was the copper/rust, it is very pretty."
4.0,"Very nice mask would have gave it 5 stars if it was a little larger, I had problems getting it to cover my chin, the size seems better fit for a child than an adult but overall great quality.<br /><br />4 star rating safe buy"
4.0,My father has swollen feet because of his age and he likes that he can easily slip these on without having to bend over.
4.0,Fits well. I'm hoping they soften up some after a couple of washes. They're kinda stiff feeling.
4.0,"Pretty dress, I bought it for my daughter and she liked it.  She got many compliments."
4.0,Very fast delivery!  Chain is both sturdy for some heavier pendants and delicate in appearance.  Very shiny white silver color.
4.0,"I didn't like that it didn't come as described and it was a little on the large side. I thought I'd ordered a cocktail type dress (cheap). It makes an adorable swimsuit cover up, though."
4.0,Ring is beautiful but not sustainable
4.0,Nice quality. The L tag was too big on my 34D chest
4.0,Good smaller then I thought but good I like them
4.0,"Well constructed with thick fabrics. The purple color is very lovely. The sleeves were a little loose on me, but the rest of the fit was as expected. I will ultimately be returning it because I no longer need the item but it seems like a very flattering dress. The bottom plaid portion felt stiff to me, but I think it would soften up after washing. My measurements are as follows: Bust (at fullest with bra) 36&#34;, Waist 28&#34;, Hips 39.5&#34;, Height 5'2&#34;, Weight 125."
4.0,"Very nice, it is not balky and it is better that I expected."
4.0,Great color just didn't order the correct size for myself
4.0,"It's a cute necklace, looks almost like the photo. I did deduct a single star because the cherub isn't quite as well defined as it appears here but is still clear enough I've bene complimented on it."
4.0,I love the fact that I can put it on my wrist when I am carrying extra bags in the house.
4.0,Perfect for hunting!
4.0,"The materials used are cheap but surprisingly they've held up with my toddler. Not much sole padding but for the price, good play shoes."
4.0,"Nice quality,  smaller then I thought it would be.."
4.0,"Quality and fit for the price paid is worth every penny. As a result, I look for dresses based on the Homeyee brand!"
4.0,"Me gusto mucho su calidad es buena, solo un poco ajustado."
4.0,I was pleased with the tiny earrings! They came in a drawstring velvet bag. Nice size for the 7 yr.old granddaughter for a Christmas gift!
4.0,The bag is cute really small but cute. I needed it a little bigger since I'm hoping to be using it for 2 babies maybe a nice bag for a teen.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e9016d8fd8d328ad3c8695066c457996]] I liked the costume including the mask, the only bad thing is that the mask is torn.  The other bad thing, is that I need it for this coming Saturday and ordered it with plenty of time to get here.  Today is Wednesday, three (3) days before the event.  But, now with the Mask Torn, I can not wear it like that, what can I do?  Unless, you can over night the mask, that will work and have the complete costume for Saturday."
4.0,I was happy with the performance of these stockings.
4.0,Casual sexy top. Love it
4.0,"Good leather belt, it is a little light and thin for my taste. However, if a lightweight and strong leather belt is what you're into, then this might be your top pick."
4.0,"Super comfy, if a bit too clingy in the legs.  This is a great onesie if you want to be ultra comfortable while also showing the ladies (or gents, if that's your preference) that you work out regularly."
4.0,Nice watch. Easy to read and prefect size. For thr money it works well and looks like a more expensive watch. Quality buy for almost nothing.
4.0,"I ordered opal. I've worn it everyday for a month and it still looks great. My only complaint is the post is a bit too long, so if the earring gets caught it will turn. It is annoying, but I still love the look and curve."
4.0,Granddaughter is afraid of thunder.  These seem to get her...and me...through summer thunderstorms.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful! I ordered an extra small and it fit great but it was still really long, so I recommend ordering it early and getting it hemmed before you wear it."
4.0,Durable and Comfortable.
4.0,Like the material an color
4.0,"I like how it hides my blubber. Bitches be thinkin‚Äô I ain‚Äôt fat, but I really be."
4.0,Does what it is supposed to do so far.
4.0,I bought this for vacation and I liked it so much I ended up using it as my regular summer bag too. I have one complaint though... I really wish they would have made the strap pocket using a Velcro closure instead of a zipper.  It would be SO much more convenient to be able to take my cell phone out with one hand rather than having to mess with a zipper.
4.0,Just is somewhat small for me. I was constantly pulling the shirt up
4.0,"This product showed up in a search for women's footwear, so I assumed that the size 10 was for a lady's size 10. That is not the case.<br />I ordered the size 10 and it is a man's size 10 so if you are purchasing this, please know that that is their sizing.<br />The foot bed has a small rise for the arch, not really enough that I would call these arch supportive footwear. Even though the size is a bit off I've been wearing them for the sake of reviewing them.<br />Like most footwear of this type, and by that I mean the pressed foamy plastic, these flatten a bit after wearing. They're never going to feel as comfortable as the first few times you put them on.<br />For what they are, which is shower shoes that can be occasionally worn outside, I would expect them to cost a dollar or two less, but the price isn't totally out of line these days."
4.0,Pretty and fits great.
4.0,Very cute but bend easily
4.0,True to size. Very nice for the price
4.0,"I used this for a Halloween costume. The shirt fit nicely, not too tight. The socks were good quality. The hat as a little small, it barely stayed on my head."
4.0,"My friend loves this piece, even though it took her almost 1 month to get it."
4.0,"Wow.  I was fearful of ordering this dress here are so many listings for counterfeit clothes that are too expensive to return.  But, I took a risk on this one since it was on Amazon Prime and I could send it back easily.  I have to tell I am SO PLEASED! It knocked me out.  It looks so great.  EXACTLY AS PICTURED.<br /><br />What I like:  the style is so attractive and and makes anyone look good.  The belt is actually a faux belt across the front so it does not add bulk, but visually makes your waist look smaller.  There is an additional zipper on the side! This makes it fit better and it's easier to put it on/take it off.  The fabric is just a tad stretchy so it looks like it was made just for me.  I also like the elbow sleeves.  IMO that's always the most attractive option.<br /><br />The fabric is a bit heavy. Obviously synthetic. I would not wear it on a hot day.  So, it's not top of the line, but it was so unbelievably cheap I'm quite impressed with the value.  It's super cute!"
4.0,"These are so soft and shockingly not as see through as I thought. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 ~170 lbs and finding black shorts that aren‚Äôt see through is tough, but these are good! I‚Äôm a size 10-12 and I got a Large and they fit perfect! They‚Äôre a good length too, not too long not too short"
4.0,"This jacket is good quality for the price! It's not very warm because it is lined with a silk-like material, but it's warm enough for the Southern California weather I bought it for. The fur is soft and appears to be good quality. Like some other reviews mentioned, the sleeves are a bit short, but it's not noticeable when you're wearing it. Also, the pockets weren't big enough to hold my IPhone 11, but they can fit a small wallet or something similar in size. I ordered a medium (I'm 5'5, 135 pounds, for reference) because they were sold out of the small size and it was pretty oversized on me, so I'd say it's true to size. Overall, this jacket is definitely worth the price if you're not looking for too much warmth!"
4.0,Bought for niece. Saw her try on. Usually things run a little big on her and this just fit. So runs a little on the smaller side.
4.0,"Great purchase the quality of the bag is great ... the price fantastic for the quality.... The only down fall for me is that it only has one compartment no dividers or separator in the compartment, other than that it is great. Colour is gorgeous and matches a pair of boots I purchased via amazon."
4.0,I love this cardigan!!! It's nice and heavy and doesn't feel cheaply made at all. It keeps me toasty and fits well. I'm 5'2&#34; and 130lbs and is a bit oversized but perfect for me. My only complaint and why I'm giving it 4 stars was the smell. The smell was a little strong and smelly but I just threw it in the wash and the smell was out and the cardigan took well to the washer.
4.0,"This was awesome for my kid's Halloween costume. It's soft, fit well, and did great when I applied heat transfer vinyl to it"
4.0,"I love the dress, just a little small for me. But I still wear it whenever I can. and the material is nice."
4.0,"Really cute and fits great, not too tight.  I bought two, black and white.  I'm so tired of visors that press really hard behind the ears."
4.0,The shoes are very cute and good quality.
4.0,"I like this top. The fit is good and it washes well. But it is not red, as described. It's closer to an orangey-coral color."
4.0,"Excellent jacket, I wear it often, I recommend buying a couple sizes larger than what you normally wear if you want a semi loose fit. Well made. Reverse or European zipper takes a bit to get used to. Otherwise excellent, I actually bought two more very similar to this off an Instagram ad, they are not as well made as this one, but they are of a very similar (if not the same) material. I highly recommend this jacket, well designed for active outdoors use."
4.0,I ordered my size which is a size 6 and they were to big. Fabric was nice jeans were cute..
4.0,I like this swimsuit the color is beautiful the fit is a bit small.
4.0,"Positive: the tiger's eye pair of plugs in this set are my favorite. I love the weight of the stone.<br /><br />Positive: All of these plugs have a groove in the back to make it harder for the O-rings to slide off. That is unusual with stone plugs, in my experience. The groove isn't deep by any means and the O-rings still slide off, but the fact that it's there at all makes me happy.<br /><br />Negative: The jade is much darker than pictured. It's fine, but it's not as striking as the photo. They also seem like they're covered with something, like a wax or maybe dye? I washed them and they still feel strange, but nothing has come off on my hands, so it's a draw. I have several other pairs of jade plugs and none of them feel like these.<br /><br />Negative-ish?: The howlite pair I received is totally white on the front, but speckled through with the black on the back of the plug. It's not a deal-breaker, but they look different from the photo.<br /><br />I might buy these again if I lost them for some reason. I like the tiger's eye plugs enough that it makes up for my ambivalence about the others."
4.0,"Bigger then I expected, like half my hand. But other then that it's very light and my mom loved it. No real complaints other then it was bigger and slightly feels cheap in the chain."
4.0,"Product came cracked, not sure if delivery driver did it or not but love the mask"
4.0,"The Neck part is loose as described by another post but other then that it looked great , fit nice and was comfy !!"
4.0,Very comfortable wear and keeps warm
4.0,I always get compliments on all of them!
4.0,great material and product quality just wish i had not listen to some of the reviews and had gone with my regular size small. I always love this company. great products
4.0,It was a little thinner than I imagined but I love it
4.0,I liked the material but it is short for me.
4.0,"This watch is elegant and very stylish. I got this watch for my dad and when I gave it to him, he immediately switched his old watch for this one. We love the fact that that you can set the date on this watch. The only problem was that the box doesn't come with any instructions so we needed to mess around with it for a while before we figure out how to correctly set it. My mom said that it would hard to give this as a gift to someone because of the lack of instructions. But overall, my dad really likes this watch. He has been wearing it every single day since he got it.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Thank you for reading."
4.0,Absolutely love it. Too funny!! Little tight around the neck but who cares. Son and I both went as Sumo wrestlers for Halloween. My son is eight and I‚Äôm thirty eight. I‚Äôm 6-2. My son is average height.
4.0,"I loved the earrings. Looked good with what I had on. But, one earring broke within 2mins after putting them on. Can't be fixed. üò¢"
4.0,"Fabric great, a little stretchy! Fits to size and looks great on."
4.0,"This bathing suit is just as cute in person.  The material doesn't have much give and I'm not sure if I should have sized up or if it actually runs small, but it's a tight fit.. if I could do it again, I'd size up.  However, for the price it's not worth dealing with the return process for me.  I'll save it and hopefully be able to wear it next year when I'm not nursing."
4.0,My feet love these socks. They fit well and wash well and are so soft. Wish they had grips on the bottom so I could wear them on the floor.
4.0,don't block all of the glare
4.0,"I have wide feet and these fit pretty good except for the pinky toe it hurts. But I have fairly wide feet so it was to be expected. These are very cute and my ankles can swell so I am glad they had buckles that actually can be adjusted. I could see where these may be to wide for anyone with narrow feet, possibly even medium width feet. But a med/wide foot would probably be the best fit. I won't wear them to often due to the pinky toes pinching but they are really cute."
4.0,"Good product, but not the blue I want, need more color."
4.0,The only downside to this shirt is that there is no tag to easily tell you which side is the front or back. I did end up wearing ti backwards one day and it was quite uncomfortable. When I put it on correctly the next time it was much more comfortable.
4.0,"Good pair of sunglasses, the lens are fantastic with the polarized ones. The material isn`t that good, probably won`t last long, but its a good buy."
4.0,Very nice and cute!  It is very low cut so I had to wear a lacey camisole underneath it but it was a big hit!
4.0,Normally wear a large... brought the xxl for a little extra roominess.  Fits a tad bit too tight.  About a size and a half different.
4.0,"Nice and sturdy, nice to look at, works fine.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a good knock around watch."
4.0,"Love the fit!<br />Ordered 2XL wear size 14-16<br />Does ""ride up"" in crotch area as walking<br />Length/height same as others bought.<br />Not super short!<br /><br />Leopard print material is shiny. Hard to dress down."
4.0,Really like this dress.. can be dressed up or down!
4.0,This is my second purchase of a Mariana Guardian Angel pendant.  They are exactly the same except they have different colors to the crystals.  The other side of the pendant is a pretty picture of an angel.  This is a beautifully made piece of jewelry.  I am a lover a jewelry and you will not be disappointed.  It is made in Israel and it has a lifetime warranty so you cant possibly go wrong.  It is extremely well made and absolutely beautiful.  It is only about the size of a nickel but looks so pretty on the neckline. It sparkles like crazy so the only thing you have to choose is the color!!  The chain is super sturdy and shiny and there is a two inch extender and a little charm that hangs off  the extender and a tiny piece of a gemstone on the end of it.  I did not receive anything for this review.  I wanted to tell people how much I love my new necklace.
4.0,These socks are well made...they do have compression...they feel soft and comfortable...they wash well...I use them on my walks...
4.0,"so very soft, just what I wanted, just a little bit large."
4.0,"The fabric is a soft stonewashed denim exactly like the photo. They have a finished hem which is flipped up and tacked at the side seams in a way that is not really a cuff, but is exactly like the photo. They have an inside tag that says made in China and none of the tags are in English. The zipper sticks and the button hole is fraying, but the waistband lining is really nice."
4.0,A bit smaller than I expected...<br />But nice bag
4.0,"Fit is just not what I like in a t-shirt it is very boxy but other than that it is a great design, and comfortable. I just do not like how it looks on me. It was just okay."
4.0,Looks really nice but the buckle up part is very weak.
4.0,one of the balls keep coming off but I'm not sending these back 2 for the price of 1 and this is what I've been looking for.
4.0,Pay attention to the specs on these.  They are really quite tiny.
4.0,Super cute. Just a bit short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù though.
4.0,"The material is kinda strange and hard, the lining underneath the dress is like a pant.."
4.0,It was a gift a my daughter loves it.
4.0,Nice headband.  Very comfortable and stays on well.  Great color too!
4.0,Very nice piece of jewelry! Good value for the money.
4.0,"I really enjoy these shoes, exceeded my expectations.  Fit to correct size and great shoes for CrossFit type workouts.  I don't know how they perform on runs but they seem to be good to for the very short jogs I have done.  Great shoes highly recommended.  Only issues has been some of the rubber has come off the sole slightly.  Not something that is good but some super glue fixed that.  Great shoes!!"
4.0,"Is there anything better than soft, fleecy pjs on a cold, rainy morning? This is nice set especially if you have company and don't want to get dressed without looking like a slob. These are very soft and easy to wear. I like them for curling up with a good book and a better dog."
4.0,Width around neck is fine. Length is very long. I cut mine in half and now I have two that fit way more comfortably.
4.0,Cute but the bottoms were big
4.0,It's ok - I have to figure out what to wear it with.
4.0,"Fit is a little small, but other than that great product. Especially for the price!"
4.0,"This watch looks very nice for the price and keeps good time, but you can tell that it 's not an expensive watch. The crystal is durable, but not like a sapphire one, light weight and a little thicker the excepted. You can tell a difference Between  my Citizen echo drive or even my Bulova.This watch is more like a fancy Timex. so you get what you pay for. not bad."
4.0,"Very cute pendent, especially for someone who likes the butterfly garden theme. My only concern is that the design is not attached and simply clasps on. Overall it's a very nice gift!"
4.0,"the wife loves the boots but the heel wore out within the first 3 or four times to wear them. Will be taking them to a boot repair place to have new heels installed. This is her second pair of the same boots, the first pair did not do this"
4.0,A bit bulkier than expected but still OK
4.0,"Love this dress! It‚Äôs perfect for a date night, church, or a summer wedding. You can dress it down with sandals or dress it up with nude heels."
4.0,"First off, the brown fleece leggings (0-6) arrived very quickly, are super soft on the inside, and have a nice matte-sheen to them (not really shiny, just that kind of smooth-fabric-so-light-sort-of-reflects-off-it type glow).  They're super stretchy, a warm, chocolate color, and worked perfectly to complete the look I was going for.  I'm about 5'8'' 150, typically between a size 6 and 8, and all limb (aka, I love that cigarette pant length is back!). They were plenty long, which was fantastic! And the waist was nice and high (which I liked to keep my tummy warm).  AND they passed my ""Bend & Snap"" test (You know, like Elle Woods from Legally Blonde?) So they had plenty of coverage in the back without having undergarments show through (even the teeny-made-of-nearly-no-fabric kind).<br /><br />However, I took them out of the package, put them on, and wore them that day with a tunic-type sweater and they are pilled around the hip area. (Hence, the 4 stars).  I suppose I can't really complain, because these are quite inexpensive. I am going to see if a de-piller will help.  I would still recommend these to anyone; just know that the longevity is probably something to keep in mind. (Or, it's always possible I just paired the worst two fabrics together and that's on me). I do plan on buying a second pair (because really, super quality fleece leggings can easily be $40 a pair) in THIS color. I have another review on the white color (Update: which apparently Amazon won't post).<br /><br />(Update:) Definitely invest in that de-pilling thing. I'd still recommend these, but they're not going to be your fancy, top quality leggings. They're your to-go for lazing around the house or running errands."
4.0,Dress is beautiful. The color is like the picture and the fabric is thin but not too sheer. The way it is smocked at the bust and flows at natural waist is really flattering and I do find it makes me look thin.<br /><br />My con is that I have very broad shoulders and the way it is cut means that I can only wear it as an off the shoulder dress. The sleeves will not stay up on my shoulders at all. I plan to return it for that reason but that‚Äôs just preference. Otherwise it‚Äôs a very lovely dress and I recommend!
4.0,"Easy off and on with the pull cords, holding up really well and they look pretty cool. How about that."
4.0,"I really like the size, compartments & color of this wallet.  You can place your requirements conventually & easy places to locate!"
4.0,Worth every penny! Perfect size. You can‚Äôt see my eyes through them and they are comfortable! 4 stars for the best cheap sunglasses!
4.0,My husband said they feel good but fit a bit small.
4.0,"Cheap metal, and bought for a friend that is no longer a friend. I think she likes them though. They‚Äôre cute for what they are"
4.0,"My head is 23 1/2 inches and this hat is too small for me. It's not stretchy (which is good, stretchy hats hurt my ears) so you need to have one your size or bigger in order to wear it.<br /><br />Great hat otherwise--the lining seems really warm and also pretty versatile for a wide range of weather. Definitely going to keep you warmer than a typical knit hat or beanie because of the fleece lining and also the nice earflaps.<br /><br />Had to return mine due to size, unfortunately."
4.0,I liked the product. It‚Äôs comfortable
4.0,"Good products, sizing chart is way off, they can go in the closet till next year. Size small on my 50lb,46&#34; tall 5 yo: jacket twice as big as her, 8&#34; too big in length, breadth and sleeve length, pants 10&#34; too long."
4.0,Was shorter than I expected but looks great!
4.0,My 5 years old loves it.
4.0,the bottoms fit great! I'm 5'6 175 lbs and it covers my belly well....the top is cute however I'm a 36DD so my boobs do not fit in the top very well. I ordered a XL . If the top was maybe one more size up I think it would fit better.
4.0,"Not perfect, but still one of my favorite thongs I've tried. I'm six feet tall with a 32 inch waist and ordered a large in the &#34;4 Colors&#34; variety. It's soft, comfortable, and has plenty of room up front. Unlike some thongs, I can wear this all day and it's so comfortable I forget it's there. My only concern is durability since the fabric is rather thin, but even that helps makes the garment cool and light."
4.0,"The shorts are cute, although the material is a little cheap. They wrinkle very easily, but altogether I love them!"
4.0,"She loved it! Very nice band, fits just right for her."
4.0,Customer loved it.<br /><br />It was smaller than I thought - but as a whole the customer liked it.<br /><br />Thank you.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô6 and 225, usually order things in XL or XXL.  I first ordered this (blue rye dye stretch with the cross cross in the back) in XL and it was SO big I returned it for a Medium.  The M will work but I could have gotten a Small!  So I would say for sure size down TWO sizes.  It‚Äôs a very thin material but very very soft and flowy.  I really do like it though.  Just very thin, soft, and stretchy."
4.0,The band is great. Easy to take on and off and very comfortable. The case did not work well. It would become foggy anytime I was working out.
4.0,Look amazing and classic for all looks!
4.0,"The dress is extremely comfortable. Love that it's machine washable, just wish it was also machine dry. I still put it in the dryer, though, on delicate for 10-15 minutes, then hang dry. Works great, no wrinkles."
4.0,It'll be another year before they fit my daughter
4.0,"I loved these rings. I wear about a size 8. There r suppose to b 3 midi rings and 3 regular rings. However, one of the midi rings is slightly larger and will fit on my ring finger. Great buy. However, don't wear them while washing your hands."
4.0,Love my new bag.  Had a problem with the size which the company took care of immediately.  Nice product at a great price!
4.0,"Comfortable, not thick or for really cold weather but a nice pajama hoodie or cool weather hoodie"
4.0,"This dress is nice, doesn't hide any lines as it is quite clingy, used for a Halloween costume got many compliments on it. It was quite long and kept getting caught on things but easy to bunch up. Came with a bit of a smell but one wash took care of that. Not sure I'd use for every day wear but good enough if you are dressing up for a costume."
4.0,"Other people got a free Voice Amplification Unit.<br /><br />I did not get one, but the feelings on that are mixed since:<br /><br />1) it didn't explicitly say that it included VPU, but the picture is a stock photo of the mask with VPU (maybe just carelessness, but still)<br />2) other people actually did receive a VPU ($600 freebie essentially)<br />3) it's competitively priced for just the mask minus the VPU<br /><br />Besides that, the mask arrived with a residue on the rubber material that contacts your face that needed washing off. My impression was that this residue was from long years in storage, and it came off after a few careful washes with dish soap.<br /><br />It also smelled like it was stored near cattle (you know that distinct farm smell if you've ever been near cattle).<br /><br />On the mask I received, the negative pressure seal is very robust and can handle the full pressure of your diaphragm when plugging the positive pressure port. The positive seal is distinctly less robust and I noticed the tiniest bit of backflow when I talked, but I don't know if that's a seal problem or just by design. Either way it should still provide 100% filtration because that port is covered by the filter.<br /><br />So overall it gets 4 stars for a functioning product that arrived intact and it only loses a star because of logistical flaws and the confusion surrounding the VPU.<br /><br />There's reviews of the features of the mask all over the internet so I'll leave it at that."
4.0,This robe is soft and comfortable. Sizing is correct as well. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is that the pockets are too small. I can‚Äôt even fit my phone in them.
4.0,"My old watch broke, and this was the cheapest digital watch I could find with a black band. One star knocked off for the backlight not fully illuminating the screen and instead only lighting up a small sliver of the left side. Still a working watch and I wear it every day."
4.0,somewhat long will ned to be shortened but should be a good dress for fall/winter.
4.0,"Beautiful colors, good quality material.<br />I am 5'8&#34;, 142 lb, size 38 B chest<br />Looking for something cute but modest for a post baby body<br />I got a medium and it fits well, except the torso piece is a bit too short. Even with the straps loosened all the way it still feels too short from crotch to chest.<br />I took the front ties off because I like the way it looks better without them<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy and comfortable to move and swim in, even when holding small kids or carrying tons of beach gear<br />Cute fabric<br />Quality sewing<br />Good length of skirt (not too short but not too long)<br />Adjustable straps<br />I have washed it and it held up just fine on a regular cycle, I do recommend line drying<br />Removable breast pads<br /><br />Cons:<br />The attached briefs are a bit smaller than I wanted, but they don't ride up when I walk. They show some booty cheek rather than covering the whole booty, but all that is covered by the skirt.<br />No real support for my smaller chest, just some super rigid removable pads. My breasts just kind of float behind the fabric rather than being supported by anything<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />A great suit for a great price! I highly recommend this for moms who are still young but no longer feel comfortable in a bikini. I can run and play and swim with my kids without worrying about my suit falling apart or my lady bits falling out. I also feel more confident and cute than I do in a more revealing suit. If the torso was a bit longer that would provide more chest support and then I would bump this up to 5 stars."
4.0,great colour but was too big had it taken in a bit
4.0,This is a cute top.  It is not thin or flimsy.  I would buy another but this particular print would look better on a taller person.
4.0,"I bought this bag for myself i like the leather quality and there are more pockets in it, it is stylish and has classic and retro design, we can put anything like cards, wallets and other necessary stuffs. I liked this bag and will recommend to others as well."
4.0,Was disappointed a fill in ID card wasn't included.
4.0,"I like the headband use them for workout bands.<br />The bands keep my hair in place and hold sweat while I workout.<br />Also, good to use when you have a bad hair day."
4.0,Belt seems good quality will have to wait until it gets worn a few more times. Daughter is a size 12 the XL fits perfect.
4.0,"I'm usually a meduim but I ordered a large. Fits great, but material is thin and kinda see-through. Still wearing it though :)"
4.0,I got this for my mom who works at home office work. She really likes it and said back pain stopped once she put this on and it held her stomach in with no pain.
4.0,"little see though, when wearing a black bra underneath, but other then that I have no complains.A plus as it came a week early!!"
4.0,"Very nice, true to size, bottoms are slippery on hardwood and tile."
4.0,"Good fit,  cute"
4.0,I am 5'5 185 lbs usually size 14 and the XL was a tiny bit snug and too short for a dress by itself. I will wear with leggings thought. The material is very think. and has a little stretch to it.
4.0,Cute and fashionable but upset that I requested a purple stone in memory of my rattie Harry but it is pink no were near purple.
4.0,"I liked this dress for a wedding I attended. It was very cute and form fitting, however, it kept twisting to one side and it was a little annoying. I also couldn‚Äôt get the sides to stay down on my arms, so I just went with it and left them up on my shoulders. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh around 150 and I ordered a large and it was tight but not uncomfortable."
4.0,"smaller than expected but sturdy bag, nice for the office"
4.0,"My daughter needed this dress for school. My only complaint is that it was a little low cut in the chest, and that the material is a little thin."
4.0,there cute but wore them for only a weak and the are broken they make weird sounds and the glasses just weren't worth it
4.0,I doubt I can get 28 bills down in here . I think I can get more like five or six hundred dollars in..
4.0,Good price and good quality!!
4.0,Works as described.  Quiet.  It has 4 program modes and the TPD can be adjusted just as I wanted.  However I worry about cradle which is spring loaded.  The tension of the spring is a bit strong which I worry may place unnecessary strain on the leather belts or bracelets of the watches.
4.0,"Pretty great! I use these for 3 purposes:<br /><br />1. clean up glass (nasty mess!)<br />2. moisturize hands at night<br />3. keep me from chewing my fingers off<br /><br />I've tried a lot of different gloves through the years because of that last one... these fit really well and are comfortable.<br /><br />the thumb comes folded inside, that's annoying."
4.0,Easy to use. They work well. Good price.
4.0,"Very soft fabric, Fits well ,except for the length. Will adjust that"
4.0,I followed the recommendations for the size of this dress and it was a little snug. I let my daughter try it on and it fit her perfectly. So I guess it all worked out OK
4.0,Order a size up from what you would normally wear.
4.0,Speedy delivery! Tops fit a little small but nicely.
4.0,Nicely done. Color and depth come alive in the sunlight.
4.0,warm fits good
4.0,The black ones were slightly smaller than the white..  fit a little loose but overall satisfied
4.0,A little larger than I wanted (floppy brim hangs in face) but I will work with it.  Color is a grayish-blue that works well with most things I wear and it rolls up nicely.
4.0,"Works great if you have a large purse. The color is a beautiful cranberry which I LOVE! But, once all cards, money, and phone are inside, it is bulky because it is a normally-sized woman's wallet. The other part I don't like about it is that it is a tri-fold wallet and the 3rd part has a snap; so, it's arduous to get into the place where my CCs are..."
4.0,"Ordered a small, was sent a medium. Rather presumptuous frankly üòê,  but not even mad as the medium fits nicely."
4.0,"Too long, paid $20.00 to him it. Used excess material to make a tie belt."
4.0,These glasses are absolutely beautiful.  But large
4.0,"At first glance these look flimsy - thin shiny fabric.  But wearing and washing haven't done any damage, so I'm happy with them.  The pockets are deep enough (front and back).  They do seem a bit shorter than in the photo (and the fit for me is perfect, not too tight or loose), but not too short at all.  Overall although I was concerned that they might not hold up because the fabric is so thin, they seem to do the trick!"
4.0,"Good quality, just make sure you know which one your getting. It's not an assortment."
4.0,Alway love 89th and Madison pants for work! A little see thru but not major. I am 5 foot and order Medium come right below my knees
4.0,"These are very cute, but sadly they stretched out very easily. The joints were too weak, so they started sliding off my face."
4.0,"This replaces a bracelet who's Guru bead broke. This one's very pretty, but just a tiny bit big for my average-sized wrist."
4.0,"I'm usually a 7.5/8 so I got these in a 7.5 and they were a little too big, but if you wear them with thick socks, they're okay. Also, it's hard to walk on anything that's not concrete or carpet or some sort of rough surface because the soles are plastic instead of rubber or a slip proof material. I have to walk slowly and be very careful on my wooden floors and ceramic floors. Other than that, the shoes are gorgeous and definitely worth it. Love them! 9/10!"
4.0,"Its cute, it looks just as pictured. I d give 5 stars if only it wouldn't roll up every time I sit in the car..."
4.0,Tops perfect the pants are too big.
4.0,"The fabric is heavy and stiff.  It does not stretch very much, so they are tight on me.  I would have liked them wider and shorter.  I may not use these very often because of how difficult they are to pull on.<br /><br />They are too long for me.  I read another review where they cut the extra length off.  I may try that."
4.0,My son loves these shoes. He finds them comfortable and easy to put on. They are beyyer made than I was expecting. My only criticism is that they run a hair small. If your kid is close to growing out of the size or needs a half size which they don't offer just go up. The strap could also use to be a little longer since there's no half sizing.
4.0,does it come with the pods??
4.0,The one from Apple is better but this is good
4.0,"It feels nice on my skin. The only thing is that the string that's in the inside broke off, so it doesn't fit as snug as before, but I still like it."
4.0,Great shirt. Great quality.
4.0,Fits as expected. Love the colors!! One star off because you can see the seams where the colors join (the seams are raised up slightly).
4.0,Love these. So cute.
4.0,Bracelets are just average.<br />Made of high-quality jewelry pewter. Length can be adjusted.<br />Heartbeat color changing bracelet: It changes color when worn on the body through body temperature.<br /><br />There was nothing included to show that the bracelets do change colors or what the changing color means. This would be nice if you were to give as a gift.<br />I had to really look for the color to change.<br /><br />Bracelets are just okay.  Something you would see at the register of a store to get you to add to your purchase at check out. My 13 year old likes them.
4.0,Love the bathing suit! I like the fit and the coverage.
4.0,This shirt. It feels cool
4.0,"Anti-fog feature works, need to spray on and allow to air dry."
4.0,The sizes run small so this is a better fit.
4.0,"Very cute, fits perfect on my waist and covers my hips just fine. I ordered this aqua/teal color and black. Great price and style. Will be taking to Cabo this weekend!"
4.0,"These glasses work.  No set of glasses are going to be a silver bullet in stopping light.  But these help in reducing the brightness and the blue spectrum from hitting your eyes.  Iany pair of glasses stopped all the light, you should not be driving.  Good reducer."
4.0,"You pay what you got. The material is good, and it fits well on me."
4.0,My fault. I bought them too big. They are beautiful shoes though.
4.0,For the price it is good.  The material is nothing special but can't complain about the price.
4.0,"Really pretty and sparkly, only thing I don't like is there stiff and hard to close, hurts my fingers"
4.0,"Very satisfied, comfy shoes, look nice. The only thing is that the color is slightly lighter than what I expected."
4.0,"They look great. Perfect in length, just a tad small in width; which doesn't affect my granddaughter because she's thin."
4.0,"I wore this to the 2022 Fan expo in Dallas, Texas. While attending I received a lot of compliments on my Hinata Shoyo Cosplay. I wear this cosplay a lot, and it is comfortable, but I recommend getting one size larger than previous clothing purchases, because the product runs smaller. Overall, it is affordable and pretty good quality."
4.0,Thought I would get multi colors since that‚Äôs what the picture suggests. Got 6 pairs of only black. Oh well. Nice socks though.
4.0,The costume is high quality. Your should order a size smaller than what you are. I‚Äôm a medium in men‚Äôs size but I ordered a small because other reviews said that the pants were too long. A small fits perfectly.
4.0,Bought a few of these to give away with my sons pictures. Super cute & material is not cheap plastic. Just wish a bigger picture could fit.
4.0,Very cute! Darker in color than the picture! I'm 5'3 141lbs and I got a XL and I normally wear a medium in clothes. The quality is great!
4.0,Small size. Easy to read. Water resistant with plastic band. I use it as a work watch.
4.0,the material is not fancy but the dress is easy to throw on and look nice and that is something I appreciate.
4.0,The size of these is very dainty. I like them but they tend to fall down easily.
4.0,just received these today. bought for my granddaughter and I think she will love them. it did take a lot longer to get because it came from china  but overall they look expensive. I did get this for a discount for my honest  review.
4.0,"Loved the waiter, but due to my size I was unable to bend over in them.  They were tight.  Perfect for a smaller size person.  Good quality and durable."
4.0,Just fit big. But that‚Äôs fine
4.0,The frame feels stiff compared to the similar styled Oakley's but for the price they compare very well! The polarization is satisfactory and they fit snug to my face once the frame is situated a little. I bought them for paddle boarding and playing in a men's softball league. I love that they look like Oakley's but cost a few bucks so if they're lost or destroyed I can easily replace them.
4.0,"These workout pants look great. The fit is good and they are comfortable. . I bought medium, I normally wear a size 6/8. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù so there is some extra room meant for taller people and the high waist is quite high on a shorter person. Nothing I didn‚Äôt expect. The one big bummer is that these are *not* tumble dry. That is the only thing which  would prevent me from buying another pair."
4.0,The bracelet is pretty in person and the gold on it has lasted through about 4 wears which is rare in my opinion. There is a stone missing though and in that ruins the look for me.
4.0,"I bought these as accesory part of my Cleopatra costume  for halloween, and now wear them  every now and then  as regular earrings.  Only wish the closing clasp on the earring was less abrasive on my ear, but that's probably just my sensitive ears. Other than that, I made out well with this purchase."
4.0,I like the secret pocket.
4.0,I love the hook. The heart is very pretty. It is easy to place on you key ring
4.0,Pants are not true to size. I bought a Medium and they fit like a large.
4.0,They are a little heavy but good product
4.0,"As expected for a cheap at home unprofessional piercing kit and session, I‚Äôve had no issues."
4.0,"These shirts run a little small. My petite 2 year old still fits an 18-24 month shirt and these fit her perfectly. I expected there to be room to grow when purchasing a 2t. Despite the size, these shirts are great quality and super cute. I especially love the red and pink shirts, which are nice vibrant colors."
4.0,"I have a small face and these glasses are perfect, really happy with them"
4.0,Super cheaply made but for $10 can‚Äôt really complain
4.0,"I thought the charm would have been bigger.  I didn't realize it was so small.  That's my only thought.  Otherwise, it's great."
4.0,"A very cute dress - for me it is for wearing around the house. Fit very well, and nice fabric, altho it is all polyester. Is about 5 or 6 inches long on me<br />at 5'3&#34; - so it should be long enough for taller women. I get lots of compliments."
4.0,It was good quality but just runs slightly smaller
4.0,"My larger plan was to get a new bike helmet with MIPS technology, but many don't have a visor or a sufficient one, so I thought I'd get this cap to wear underneath and open up my helmet options. It's also a cute, lightweight cap to wear post-ride with helmet hair too. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it will work for me--I have a larger head and this *just* fits, but if I pull down the bill to shade my eyes from the sun, the ponytail hole is higher than I wear my ponytail and wouldn't work with a helmet on. The ponytail hole is awesome, but it's for gals with smaller ponytails, not thicker ones. It doesn't fit my needs, but don't let that stop you from getting this if your needs align with the product description and other comments. It's a well-made, cute cap for summer."
4.0,large size is adequate for anything siver  needing polishing
4.0,love the prayer beads lots of people like them.
4.0,Good product. Fit was just great!
4.0,Good material (bathing suit mayerial)
4.0,Light and good
4.0,Great push-up for small-chested girls.
4.0,Clasp broke on second wear luckily I had a spare to change it out with other than that great product
4.0,All good. Only label inside is little buzzing.
4.0,"I love everything about these EXECEPT that they have no breathability. My hands are sweaty and clams and stuck to the inside of these when working for a short amount of time. And if you take one off mid job... it‚Äôs a feat to get them back on. Price, durability and fit are awesome tho"
4.0,"I wore these to work today and they are super comfortable and look cute. I had to do a lot of walking and there were no issues of these becoming uncomfortable by the end of the day. They have a nice cushion. You can adjust the big strap. I did not need to, these fir true to size"
4.0,I oder a size 10 but when i got my package it was a size 9 the fit a little snug but over all very nice shoes
4.0,I'm 5'7&#34; 230 lbs. It fit great. The material is nice.
4.0,"My mom loved it  however, it was a little short for her."
4.0,Fits perfectly with a classy antique look. The buckle itself isn't heavy metal but definitely gives off the look.
4.0,I ordered these from my daughters 15th birthday. She loves them. They look exactly as pictured. The are a little bigger than I though they would be but that's not an issue. They came in good time in a velvet like bag.
4.0,"I was skeptical to buy and thought it would be a cheap cloth, but to my surprise and relief the cloth of is very very good... much better than costlier tees... I love the comfort fit... it‚Äôs very good"
4.0,"This suit is super cute, however it was on the smaller side. I am 5'1, 130 lbs. Size 34 A-B cup. Carry a lot of my weight on my butt. I ordered a medium. It was snug, but it still fit."
4.0,It‚Äôs a nice shirt. Fits right.
4.0,"nice, warm and soft, but doesn't come together well at the bottom"
4.0,"Fellow reviewers have been pretty helpful in setting expectations about this product. It's a machine-knit sleeve scarf. The material is not nice enough to drape elegantly around your evening dress, but you can still rock it for a cute, casual outfit.<br /><br />As others have also suggested, I wish it were shorter so that it would be a tighter fit when wrapped around someone 5' 4'' and 130 lbs."
4.0,The plastic feels cheap but comfortable.  Good buy for the price.
4.0,Fit well but didn't last very long. Padding fell apart quick.
4.0,I purchased this extender over a month ago and so far I love it!
4.0,This is a nice band.  Wish that it would go a little larger.  It doesn't irritate like the plastic though.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 147cm tall and the size XS fits perfect except for the sleeves are a little tight.<br />Other than that, the quality is very good."
4.0,"I got a size small and they fit as expected. For reference I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 114lbs. If they had extra small I would have gotten those but these are comfy and not falling down. Go by your waist size and not your butt, the material has room in the booty for a stretch if need be!"
4.0,They are comfy after I washed them they got little fuzz balls on the inner thigh area
4.0,"For the cost, this dress was great.  However, if you don't have an hourglass figure you will need some good foundation garments.  It's nor for everyone, but it is a nice dress, especially at such a reasonable price."
4.0,Fit is great love the feel but the phone pocket is way too small for an iPhone 8. I think a flip phone might fit!
4.0,"so far it‚Äôs cozy, it keeps me warm. aaand the pockets are sewn shut :|"
4.0,When I first opened them I thought they were going to be small. I tried them on anyway and they fit but were definitely smaller and tighter than what a xl is for me that I normally wear. However the feel of the pants is soft and they are comfy. They stay up whIle wearing them. I am going to keep even though they are smaller than expected.
4.0,wish there were side buttons on either side for the mask loops.
4.0,Really good shirts for working out.
4.0,"This is seriously a choker.. Too snug for me, but I'm a plus sized woman. Really pretty though. I will be giving to my niece for Christmas."
4.0,I really like the ties and the material.  There was one tie in the bunch that was short so when I tie the tie the small end will not fit in the tail holder.
4.0,I am very small. I was hopeful these would fit but even the smallest size was a little bit too large. They still ‚Äúfit‚Äù like they aren‚Äôt falling off me when I move but they aren‚Äôt tight like I had hoped. But the pockets are amazing they fit my iPhone 8 Plus that‚Äôs in an otter box! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and weigh 95lbs
4.0,Love them.... Just wish they were a little tighter
4.0,Looks nice but I returned it due to the fact that it fit like a tent on me.
4.0,Just a little too small. Needed 1 size larger.
4.0,"The pattern of this dress is lovely, and the shape of it is a true shift - flattering on just about any figure.  The sleeves offer a light cover on your arms but are not so much that it's too warm to wear in the summer months, and when worn with tights and boots, it can easily be transitioned into a great Fall or Winter dress.  I would have given it five stars, but the neckline seems to feel a bit wider than I'd hoped, making it tricky to find the perfect necklace.  Definitely recommend!!"
4.0,"weird color, but nice belt. too red to be called coffee"
4.0,it is ok. Just what i wanted
4.0,My son has lived in this swimsuit this summer. I purchased it because his butt crack was always sticking out of the shorts and shirt swimsuit sets. After constant wash and wear it has stretched out a bit but I'd say it had more to do with me not being careful when washing then the quality of the swimsuit. The included swim hat is very funny but fits well if you need one.
4.0,"Came fast , hot!!! Can't wait to wear them Ima kill'em wid these joints."
4.0,Very loose and comfortable. I am plus-size (2-3x) with large bust and this fits me very well
4.0,I am happy with the product.  It has enough spaces for my necklaces and braclets.  And is tall enough so that my longer peices do not pool at the bottom and get tangled.  Make sure the felt peices have not come off the bottom though.  I had to restick one of them as it had come off and the metal will scrape wood furniture.
4.0,Overall good but it fit a bit too small
4.0,"Nice case, good quality.  Made for a medium/large face.  That are polarized.  Wish they had a rubber nose piece.  Overall, very happy with purchase at $55."
4.0,Good fit great grip for in the racquetball court
4.0,"The tie was a little skinnier than I expected, but my husband still liked it."
4.0,"They feel great, the material is soft to the skin. But they run small. I bought 2XL for that reason. I fit in the US size XL and I jumped the size up because everything is small ordering from Amazon. I'm just going to keep these for around the house and buy a bigger one for work. Thanks for a great product."
4.0,It was cute but it ran a little small.
4.0,My daughter Loves it. Thanks!!
4.0,Very cute necklace! Smaller than expected but very pleased.
4.0,"Pretty nice, using it as a strap for my grandfather's watch for the time being. One thing I would mention is that the tool they provide doesn't have a long straight end (good for removing already existing bars/pins). I'm glad I had my own tool because I wouldn't have been able to get the watch's original parts off to install the strap. It came with 4 extra bars as well. It's definitely leather! I'm a woman and the strap fits okay in terms of length."
4.0,"I wore this for Amazon's new show, Jack Ryan.  Everyone loved the color.  I thought it would be too big, ordered it in a size 10, so I was shocked when I opened it and it said XL.  I put it in the dryer many times and it fits fine.  These dresses all are meant to be disposable and never washed.

4.0,This brand sweat shirt is a little heavier then most sweatshirts.  It doesn't &#34;pill&#34; as quickly as other sweatshirts do.
4.0,"The size chart is very helpful. I bought the dress as a Halloween costume, and was happy it fit."
4.0,Not too much for any outfit
4.0,"This rhinestone tennis bracelet is very cute. I ordered the rainbow bracelet, and the stones were all very nice. I don't think anyone would mistake this for fine jewelry, but it definitely gives a flash of color in stacked bracelets.  While singularly worn might show that it costume jewelry, that effect is diminished when stacked with other bracelets. It stretches enough to fit over the hand and shrinks back to the appropriate size when on the wrist or taken off. The stones were all in place and well-mounted. It is a fun costume piece of jewelry that is very well-made. I do not regret ordering this bracelet."
4.0,"Bought this spur of the moment to go on a trip. Read the reviews to pick my size, I'm 5'3 137lbs.<br />Fit as expected, I ordered a medium..I wore it with leggins and boots and a scarf..was a great night out outfit.<br />Yes I would buy again. The material is not real heavy, but it's nice enough if you take care of it. Haven't washed it yet, so we will see how it fits after a wash.<br />For the money, I was happy."
4.0,"Pretty and slippery.  Looks great with the outfits I have, but hard to keep in place because of the slippery material.  Very warm/doesn't breath well in heat or humidity.  But it is sooooo pretty!"
4.0,"Shirt was very good, it was somewhat small to be a medium. One snowflake from the top was missing and material was uncomfortable. I did very much love it though."
4.0,Works well.  Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the price.  Price is a little high for what they are.  Otherwise great product.
4.0,I think the top is a little bigger.  I had to buy for my bottom half since it is bigger and then the top had a little too much room.  I have bought other Fanssie swimsuits and buying this way worked out.  Those still fit good. This one was a little different. The material in the boob area seems a little thick but when it is on it looks good.  I like the suit.  It looks very nice.
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but they are a little too heavy for me.  When I wear these, I definitely feel that I have earrings on, especially when I turn my head to the side because they are clunky."
4.0,Super cute and perfect with my accessories.
4.0,"Thoughts:<br />This is beautiful piece of jewelry! It comes with shorter chain, but you can get longer one if you want. The marble is gorgeous, Crystal blue with white clouds in the glass bead. Creates wondrous still sky view. The only thing that is irritating is the bread rolls around when wearing it, I much prefer something with a flat back.<br /><br />Details<br />The resin sphere meausures approx 20mm.<br />It is using eco friendly resin, a bio-resin which is pine oil based as opposed to petroleum based."
4.0,Fit and looked as described.  Have only worn a couple of times.  The texting portion of the finger not in the correct spot for easy texting.
4.0,"Bought as accessory for Halloween costume.  The chain links that connect the plastic mustache to the bottom of the glasses isn't long enough even for those of us with short noses.  Plan on cutting it and replacing with something else (I used fishing line) or removing altogether.  Other than that, they fit fine and the lenses are easy to see through."
4.0,So soft and comfortable. Run a bit big but they are fine.
4.0,"This is super cute for my daughter. She is 8 and is pretty tall but thin. I ordered a 10-12 because I wanted one for next year really, but it is the right size for her. I'm sure the 7-8 would've been too small even though she has others that size that fit."
4.0,"I haven't wore these gloves yet,  They fit as expected and are soft and comfortable, however I do not expect them to hold up as they are made in China and I fully expect them to be like other inferior chinese products."
4.0,"The sandals were very nice. Nicer that I expected.  The sole was soft and felt great on my foot. They seemed to be made well.  However, they were too big from top to bottom. There was a gap on the top of my foot. I ordered my usual size, 7 1/2.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
4.0,Comfortable bra. Easy to get on and off with my hand and shoulder issues. Fits smaller than previous Genie bras that are the same size but still fits. Pads are easily removed for those who don‚Äôt need them.
4.0,Nice dress for all occasions.
4.0,"Got them for my husband, he like them<br />Do not come in a box, just in a bag, so they was flat but after two days the looked like a shoe"
4.0,"Good product, Fair Price, Gets the job done."
4.0,"Super comfortable and adorable! The only issue I have are that the sides really come out a lot. It feels like a 1/2 an inch of fur is going to be dragging on my ground... If that were not the case, I would wear these everywhere!"
4.0,Amazing! The chain is a bit cheap and it took a while to get but the wait is worth! It glows just as bright as it shows in the picture!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,"I give it 4 stars because it was a really nice shirt, good material. However, it was way too big for me. I am 5'2&#34;, 125lbs and the medium was very baggy. I ended up giving to a friend, she loves it :)"
4.0,I like the skirts very much. Though I must say I'm a pretty tall individual and they hit the floor.
4.0,"Exactly as advertised.  It seems pretty sturdy.  A little hard to get cards in and out, and my phone would not fit in it... not even close.  You'd have to have the flattest phone ever with no case...."
4.0,I like them. I just wish they were a little larger.
4.0,"This ring is beautiful; however, i purchased mine at a size ten when it fits a size 9. Size up if youre thinking of purchasing"
4.0,A lot of dress. Had it altered to remove some of the pleats. It's perfect now!
4.0,Its runs a little bit large and a little bit on the heavy side--but works great-- I needed it for my daily walks in the high heat --and it blocks very well--- I would recommend it --the strap makes it nice in windy conditions so it doesn't blow away<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTWJY44/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
4.0,"I really like these jeans but I do warn you they run a little big. I wear a size 10 at American Eagle and at target‚Ä¶ I originally ordered a medium in these pants and found them to be a little loose. Even after washing them in hot water they were still loose. I specifically wear high waisted jeans because I have awkward hips and low rise jeans fall way too low on me, so the only way to keep my jeans from slipping down is to wear high waisted.<br /><br />Even after receiving a pair that was a little too big I still liked how they looked enough to order another pair in a smaller size. I ordered a size small, which is listed as a US six and they fit perfectly. I love really hit me on my body, and they are high waisted but don't dig into your waist. I recommend these for someone who is looking for high waisted product that they don't plan on wearing with a crop top. I think when you're wearing high waisted jeans with shorter shirts you want that super sleek high waisted look, or this is more of a relaxed fit for high waisted jeans. The pants are more of a JD material, they do have stretch to them and they do loose in a little bit as you wear them throughout the day.<br /><br />I am about 5'4 and I definitely have a little extra room at the bottom of the jeans. I would say that the size small could fit somebody as tall as 5'6 maybe 5'7."
4.0,Very tiny and delicate. Pretty design but extremely hard to put post on the back
4.0,This is a very large tag and quite heavy!<br />My husband had the chain shortened and he really likes it!
4.0,It says one size fits all but I don't think it means in American size because it's more of an extra small
4.0,have to pull pants up all the time got a M should have been a S I get lots of complements on pants
4.0,"like this watch, wish the beading was stationary!  I lost it a few days after wearing watch because the snap not very strong"
4.0,They are like stretched. By the time I used them I had passed the return deadline for return to have them send me a new one. But overall super cute just that problem with they are too big and fall off.
4.0,it fit as as expected but was a little too short.in all i really love the dress.the material is good especially for the price.
4.0,Fits well but is a bit thinner than expected.
4.0,"Nice quality overall, but not flattering on me. I thought this ran large. I found the quilting to look too bulky for me."
4.0,"I LOVE HARRY THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!! I would‚Äôve given it 5 stars, but it mislead me thinking there was 5 but really there was only 1."
4.0,This is a nice hat. I would order from this company again.
4.0,Love it very nice. Bought it for a gift for my husband and he loves it.
4.0,"Yup!!! These just came today & they're great! I just reviewed the matching demi bralettes (Awesome too.) I'm 5'6"" about 170#, 23 wks pregnant and measure about 40 inches in the hips. I bought the M/L size, they fit great. I checked them over after opening them and they all looked very well made. I have already washed and dryed them and they made it thru. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is simply because 1 they arent cotton which is a personal thing and 2 they do seem like they may snag easily if you have really dry hands or have a hang nail (which kind of already happened a little with 1 pair). Other than that they are winners, I will be buying more for sure."
4.0,The chain in a teeny bit too long but otherwise it's very pretty.
4.0,"The dress itself is beautiful, colors are vibrant, etc. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 160 lbs and got an XXL. It fits but is a little tight, but I do tend to carry more weight in my torso. I would say these run a bit small, if there was one size up then it‚Äôd be perfect. I‚Äôm not returning it but going to look for another spanx that‚Äôs better than what I have on in the photo."
4.0,Item was as described. Did not receive item on the expected delivery date because it required a signature.
4.0,Nice watch band. It‚Äôs either to small or to loose depending on the amount of links I take out
4.0,Very pretty dress. I'd give it 5 stars if the top wasn't see thru. I am 5'3 160lbs size 34DDD. I bought the medium it fits perfectly. It's not too short.
4.0,They were exactly as advertised and look very good!
4.0,Super shear but so darn cute. Wear something under it.
4.0,"Super cute dress. I had to modify the lace-up back so I could wear it without assistance in the morning. I replaced the ribbon with black elastic and square knotted it. Now I can slip it over my head without having to fuss.<br />The center seam is just slightly off center which makes me a little twitchy, but for the price, I can't complain. The pattern is perfectly lined up.<br />The split in the front and the back is... dangerously high. I had to sew in a lace ruffle because the split is really quite high up the leg.<br />The material washes and dries just fine, but the dress is very static-y. I sometimes wear leggings under it which helps with the slit and the clinging. But for the price, it's worth it. I can say I get a ton of compliments on it and it move very nicely when it's not clinging to my legs."
4.0,Looks steady and love the color!
4.0,I like short pants of leather. Short pants of leather feel nice. Liner inside short pants of leather feel good . hosenstall is good in short pants of leather
4.0,"I have worn the Gilligan and O'Malley pajama pants for years.  These are the Amazon version of Gilligan and O'Malley.  Not bad but not the best quality either.  I ordered the Small but received the XS.  Then ordered the Small again.  Small are 5"" longer than the same size G&O pants.  Since I am 5'1"" I am stumbling over them."
4.0,Not Spandex Material. Cotton so not very shiny either.
4.0,Nice size and decent quality at a great price. I especially like the external water bottle holder pocket. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap can't be quickly removed when not needed (no quick release snaps).
4.0,Hermoso y comodo
4.0,This necklace is so much more beautiful in person. My only complain is the chain is a little dainty.
4.0,Nice attention to detail. The design makes it very easy to determine that it is a killer whale. The color a strong and easy to see.
4.0,"Beautiful book bag. Well made and very light weighted. I brought it to use on a upcoming trip instead of a diaper bag. But after much thought I'm returning the bag because of its size. I'm 5 '3&#34; with a short torso so the book bag covers my back completely. Not that flattering as it does look like I'm lugging a big diaper bag. Nevertheless, it's a great bag, beautifully made and cmon it's Jansport!"
4.0,"These pants were true to size and work well for camping and hiking. The material is somewhat soft. It‚Äôs not perfectly quiet, but much quieter material than some other hiking pant brands I ordered."
4.0,Just started using it and so far I like it.
4.0,Great color. Nice charm.
4.0,Really love the color and the ruching on the stomach. Have washed it once so far and it has seemed to hold up well. The straps criss-cross in the back and are adjustable. Super cute suit at a great price
4.0,They look great but the diamonds are a little smaller than expected.
4.0,"If you have a short neck, be aware that this is closer to a true turtleneck than a mock. I was hoping for the 2-3 inch collar of a true mock. This has a long collar, that ended up having to be folded significantly for me. That makes it tighter around my throat, and accentuates the fact that I have a thick and short neck. Also, it is a bit short for tucking, if you have any kind of a tummy. Ah well... It will work for layering, but I'll keep looking for the perfect item!"
4.0,The front of this shirt is lined but the back is not so it's a little see through in the back.  It's a boxy shirt so you have to tuck it or something.  Wish it were a rounded or ruched hemline.  Haven't washed yet but i fully expect it to shrink a lot
4.0,"I love the material, style and colour.  I end up ordering xxxl after i read the reviews as i normally wear a size 12.  I should've ordered the xl.<br />But other than that, the swimsuit is really nice!"
4.0,These work just like I had hoped!
4.0,LOVE this outfit!  It just runs a little big in size.  I bought a newborn and my son is currently in 0-3 month clothes and it finally is starting to fit him.
4.0,The shirt would be better if it had more of an athletic fit.
4.0,"I got the black wrap around option. There are 3 different dresses on this. The black is a faux wrap around and the yellow is a true wrap around. I almost sent this dress back because I don‚Äôt like the fabric type/quality. It is a little rough and I‚Äôm afraid it may shrink. However, I‚Äôm glad I kept it because it really is quite beautiful. 5‚Äô3 126 lbs 34C-D and ordered a medium. The medium is definitely a looser comfortable kimono type fit but I think a small would have fit but not draped as well. Comfortable other than slightly rough fabric and looks a lot like the picture. Definitely will hand wash cold and hang to dry."
4.0,"I was expecting these to be thin, but they are actually a nice, thick, quality material. There are 2 pockets on the back, instead of the usual 1. These don't have the elastic band around the calf like others do though. That would be my one complaint. Other than that, these seem to be very durable."
4.0,Ordered this shirt and received a different shirt totally. Shirt I did receive was of nice quality. It's nice and thin.
4.0,The lace isn't soft. I wish it was. I would give it 5 stars. Color is pretty.
4.0,I purchased 3 sets 1 for me and the others for my daughters. I was surprised they are larger than I imagined quite sturdy. I leave one on my purse in a small ziplock bag because I tend to forget them once I‚Äôm in the store. I like them I would buy again. The colors are nice too.
4.0,"Hey y'all. These sandals were a replacement for my old, raggedy pare of (awesome) Earth Origins brand sandals. I love that brand and shall return... I do, however, want to say that these are seemingly well made, sturdy sandals with *excellent* tread. The only reason why I did not bestow upon this review a 5-star rating is because of the height, though this was entirely my fault for not realizing the height of the heel. They're too tall for me; I wanted something lower to the ground and ""chill."" Going up and especially down steps, I must watch it or I will surely fall to my death. The high heels make my a** and legs look a-okay(!) and the copper color is to die for (Gawd I love copper), but too tall for what I wanted and needed them for. Will I send back? HELL NO! I just told you that they make all the special bits look premier! Five stars in reality, four because I might fall to my death. God Bless."
4.0,5' 125lbs double D large fits a bit snug in the upper region. So many compliments on this dress...
4.0,"Im an xl 38dd 5ft 8 tall, and this fits well. Good color, will hopefully save my clothes and be a good barrier, will update with a strand test as a thread works loose to test."
4.0,"They are really soft, and even by the end of the day they aren't stretched out around the legs like some brands do."
4.0,"No instruction on how to wear it, needed to watch a youtube video and even then was struggling at times."
4.0,"Cute and comfy, but runs very small"
4.0,"Purchased the first set a while ago and the first time I tried them on, it broke. The company replaced them and so far so good on the second set. The delivery came fast on both (initial and replacement) purchases. Despite the broken earring, the exchange went smoothly. I am very pleased."
4.0,"Purchased for my wife, she is 5'1&#34; and the small was large on her, it fell below her knees.  It is a nice soft material, not too thin.  We were looking for something for her to wear with her leggings, that's doable, but with the length, it is more of a dress.  Still it is nice, worth the purchase price."
4.0,"I have such mixed reviews with this dress. First of all, it's short, which all the other reviews state. BUT, I'm only 5'2&#34; so that didn't bother me at all. I ordered the navy and the color is stunning. It's a fun, flirty dress. I wear a C cup and the V wasn't too low, but if you like modesty, this isn't the dress for you. I am returning this dress simply because the zipper is so cheap, it won't work right. I wanted to keep this dress, but I don't trust that zipper! I need a dress for a Christmas party and didn't want to be typical with red or green. This dress is stunning, so if you sew, get a zipper and replace it. Other than that, I highly recommend this dress if you want something fun!"
4.0,they are warm and love the colors.  thanks
4.0,"My sons friends absolutely love this jacket and want to have one of their own.  I will send them the link...  Fits as expected, looks nice, but is made with a material that grabs onto everything that comes into contact with it (hair, thread, pet hair, lint, etc)."
4.0,"I am 5' 2"" and weigh 135 lb. I bought size M grey and steel grey sweats.<br />The darker grey ones fit perfectly around the waist etc. but are a bit too long. They did shrink about 1/2 inch after the first wash. The fabric does not feel like its 100% cotton, but I knew that from the other reviews. But I am happy with the fabric, color and fit. The pants are very comfortable and warm. I wear them for my  morning walks and with temperatures now in low 30's they still keep me warm.<br />I returned the steel grey because the fabric was very different. Slippery kind of and the pants did not fit like the dark grey one. Too long, loose and had some stains on them."
4.0,"Good shorts. Kind of wish there was more elastic in them. They're pretty comfortable though, and they look good too. The fly is fake, simply for looks (if that matters to you). The material is pretty thin but feels strong. It has a little stretch to it but not a whole lot. I like them overall given the look and comfortable fit and feel without being too tight. I typically wear a 36 or 34 and got the size L which fits me fine."
4.0,should have come in shorter size for us short people... can't really alter this one. so I have to wear it pulled up high... darn it
4.0,Arrived on time and worked really well for a Halloween costume for myself. Kept me warm also. Washed and stayed brightly colored and did not fray. I'm not a large person but they fit a little tight on my legs.
4.0,Love it great chain and it look nice on my neck
4.0,"For the price you can't beat this set. True, it's costume jewelry and not particularly high quality, but I have seen individual earrings in this set selling at various gift shops for $7 or more and it's far more gratifying to get it a whole bunch of them here and be free from high-priced temptation at the gift shops! My favorite pair is the iridescent horizontal bar earrings - they are very nice, like cut glass, and have a great shine. The other ones aren't quite as nice but they are still pretty good for what they are. I've seen other collections that were of lesser quality and these are pretty good overall. And whatever you don't like, you could gift to family and friends."
4.0,Good non slip
4.0,"This is a beauty and other than it's really large, It is just  what  I wanted.  Just have to figure out how  to make it smaller."
4.0,"The clips on these are nice, but while these are adequate, I was hoping for a slightly sturdier coil."
4.0,Love this! Fit my son's computer and accessories
4.0,This vest fit a little snug but it was still very comfortable.  Has a great shape to it unlike some other vests that make you look boxy.
4.0,nice gift for my baby son
4.0,"these shoes are great - I have purchased these more than one summer... they wash in the washer and they're durable... sometimes the sole falls out, but you just pop it back in and get back to it!"
4.0,Good for money but not very durable
4.0,No me agrado lo liviano pero queda muy lindo puesto
4.0,smaller than expected but still wearable
4.0,"Adorable bag inside and out. The owl is actually an outer pocket. There are plenty of inner pockets, including a zippered pocket, as well as a zippered outer pocket on the back of the bag. A great medium-sized bag with straps long enough to fit over the shoulder. I only wish the bag zipped closed.<br /><br />My only complaint, and the reason for the loss of one star, is the smell of the inner fabric. It smelled fishy (the only way I can describe it). It was bad. Really bad. I turned the bag inside out and let it air out for a full day. That seemed to help, but only temporarily. I ended up having to leave it inside out another two days and spray it with perfume-only then did the smell go away."
4.0,I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and have a 38 H bust.  This dress was the ideal length.  The top was loose and wider than expected but not a huge amount.  Overall a good dress for the price point.
4.0,I always wear these hats when boating.  Lightweight and good protection from the sun.  Can be rolled up or stowed easily as they are very thin.  The cord is very important to me.  Keeps it from flying away when it blows off my head.  Sounds silly but when your boating hats blow off all the time and you dont want to be trying to fish them out of the lake.  Stays around my neck when not in use.  This one gets 4 stars because it does not vent the heat like some others I have.  They do get very warm without that.
4.0,It‚Äôs ok. Could be a better material but for the price can‚Äôt complaint
4.0,Ok so the shirt was a gift for my husband. We had washed it in cold water and hung dry but the ink on the mouth still cracked. Im going to look up ways to fix this as my husband absolutely loves it but im a bit disappointed
4.0,"Very satisfied, it is what I expected. The zipper doesn't glide very smoothly."
4.0,It's nice but too thin. Overall my daughter liked it and was happy.
4.0,"First, I loved the cloak. I gave it 4 stars because the outside layer looks lighter/cheaper in person (think fleece-by-the-yard). HOWEVER it was perfect for my costume or lounging around in the house. Was warm enough to wear outside in 50 degree weather for the day.<br /><br />I am 5'2"", 160lbs...I bought the large. It fit a little big, but how I wanted it to. I added some embellishments to the cloak and it really made it pop. I would buy again or in different colors."
4.0,this bag is very nice soft and plenty of room but I gave 4 stars because the color is not red but sort of pink red.
4.0,"I liked the material and the style, but the sizing chart is just wrong, had to return it."
4.0,Wish they would make it with a Velcro adjustable back closure. Otherwise unique and fits well.
4.0,I liked them and works out well in my store
4.0,"The frames are a little too far apart. The nose bridge is a bit too wide. But other than that, its worth it for the price"
4.0,I bought these on a whim hoping my picky son would like them...and he does! Win for me!
4.0,My husband bought thesenfornlenfor valentines day and i just love them! They have a little weight to them but they aren't overwhelming. They are really beautiful! The pictures doesn't do them justice. They are comfortable enough to wear to bed. The only problem i have had so far is the coating on one had gotten a little rough but i think that is my fault cleaning a new industrial piercing. They still look amazing.
4.0,I got this for everyday. Came on time. Is holding up and I have washed several times.
4.0,"It is a beautiful body con dress, I was expecting something loose and it wasn't. I am a 36ddd and the large made my look biger in the upper part. The dress is kind of stretchy. But it is a beautiful dress, just not for me."
4.0,"I would have given these 5 stars, but one of the bras arrived with the strap sewn in twisted. Luckily, I'm handy with a needle and thread. Otherwise, they're super comfy and fit perfect."
4.0,"the bigger ones are beautiful, the stems are a bit too long"
4.0,"Purchase the size by using the measurement chart and buying for the largest measurement - so we sized up.  Dress is beautiful, quality is great.  Our daughter loved this for her Father Daughter dance.  It took her weeks to choose this one, and she was very pleased."
4.0,"I took away one star because these aren't adjustable. I suppose I should've known because they are stainless steel which is super strong. But since I have ridiculously tiny wrists, I needed adjustability. If I shake my hand hard enough, I could shimmy this right off. If you have a more average sized wrist (like 7"") then these would probably work for you. I found the end caps to screw off easily and screw back on securely. All my bead charms by various brands fit. Just be careful if you have small wrists or larger wrists, because these bangles can't be adjusted tighter or looser."
4.0,"32DD/28 inch waist/39 inch hips<br />Ordered a M based on the sizing chart<br />I love this swim suit!  The top is rather small for me and I wish you could pick different size bottoms and tops, but for this price you can't complain.  I love the bottoms because I feel very secure and they are subtly sexy.  The one thing I do like about the top is that you can tie the bust line and they aren't hooks. I always find that when they are hooks they are never quite secure as when they are tied."
4.0,VERY small for an adult/ perfect size for a child- however a great size for an adult fastener.
4.0,"So this turns out to be sort of a shrug, and sort of a shaw, its kind of a strange fit really.  When I first opened it, I didn't know what to think.  it seemed really small just laying there....also, there were some thread ends that had to be woven in.  But I finished the ends, then hand washed and dried it, then put it away in my drawer for a couple of weeks.<br />  The other day I felt a little cool on my shoulders and decided to grab this to wear with my dress.  it actually got bigger as I wore it throughout the day...so after awhile, it wasn't short on my frame anymore and had more of the length as in the picture. Its loose and flowing but it does stay on and looks nice in its own way.  Very unusual piece, and it seems more for a dressier occasion then just hanging around the house.  It would be nice with one of those sweater clasp things"
4.0,"Decent for use around the house,  no arch support, memory foam is comfortable but not much support."
4.0,In general I liked the socks.  My only complaint is that the XL which usually fits was too small.
4.0,Love love love.<br />The hemline is alittle off and very long. I'm 5'9&#34; and it was dragging on the ground. However it raised it up to above my waist and used a belt and got so many complements on this skirt.
4.0,"Shoes feel good on my feet being I have high arches and many fusions to my spine, BUT my only complaint is I wish the shoes came in half sizes."
4.0,"My son has been wearing these glasses for a little over a month and he likes them. I like that I don't have to worry about any metal parts bending or breaking. The only complaint I have is they didn't come with a case. They came in a cheap plastic bag and the back strap has hooks instead of the little buttons that pop right in to the holes in the back. Luckily my eye place had both for free. They can be worn without the straps, but I prefer having a strap so that he can run around at school without worrying about them falling off. I would recommend giving them a try."
4.0,This is a good sports bra for my needs. I wear med. But I should of ordered a size up cause it's a little bit of a tight squeeze getting this bra off. Other then that its comfortable.
4.0,Girls loved them for Halloween
4.0,Very cute. Not top quality by any means but they are interesting and fit my size 8 1/2 feet quite well
4.0,"Fit was good, I wish the pockets didn't bunch up, but other than that a great value."
4.0,Second time ordered due the first time....only received one earring.
4.0,I bought three suits at the same time and this one fit the best. There is just something about the top of it that flatters even my big bust ..I do love it. I have to wind the ties twice about my waist to feel most secure an I dont like halters  so I make it into a bra type by winding the straps under and over. Of course the bottoms are way too big so I wrapped it down. I weigh 200 lbs 38 dd . Got the 2xl.
4.0,Cute. Wish both side was made same. One side is finished other side not.
4.0,"I like this suit, had to order size up obviously and it fits well everywhere except the chest! Overall it's a good suit though, I love it :)"
4.0,most biking shirts run small I've found. this was largest size and I would like it looser fitting but will bring on bike trip and hope for the best.
4.0,Fits my twelve year old boy perfectly.  He's small for his age
4.0,I like the envelopes.  The reason for 4 stars is that 1 (out of 5) envelope magnets did not work.
4.0,"Very pretty scarf, very authentic, a bit short though."
4.0,"They're not too thick and actually slides down a little bit during the course of the day (foot size: 8), especially when you're only wearing booties. I am using them, though, because they're perfect for boots."
4.0,"the PU leather is a little stiff.  it will take some rolling and flexing to get it where it is actually comfortable to wear.  Other than that, it appears high quality, and has a good range of size adjustments.  I don't hate it."
4.0,"Well made, beautiful but a little small. I had to change the bottom."
4.0,"I recently flew to Spain and back from the southwestern U.S. Travel in each direction lasted 16 and 20 hours. I wore these socks on each flight and noticed that my ankles were not swollen when I reached my final destination. Therefore, I assume that they worked."
4.0,"Soooo cute and great size! Can fit everything I need in it with some space to spare. The color is perfect for me and I can‚Äôt wait to decorate it. The only docks I‚Äôd give would be that the straps are a little loose so they don‚Äôt stay adjusted if you move a certain way. I just knotted mine to keep them in place! Also the side pockets are a bit small for a drink, but good for small things. I‚Äôd buy this again üíú"
4.0,The colors I got were not bright rainbow but very muted.
4.0,"my son has wanted this hoodie for months and he finally got for Easter. he loves, loves ,loves it. the sizes do run small though,which it states on the site. my son is a youth medium and I ordered a large. it fits but I wish I had ordered an extra large so he would be able to wear longer."
4.0,These are so comfortable. I like the fit and the look.
4.0,"As my county relaxes its COVID-19 lockdown Phase II, I'm getting back to work full time starting Monday. So, I needed to upgrade my wardrobe as I have gained a little bit of the ""quarantine"" weight. So, I ordered this Amazon Brand - Goodthreads Men's Lightweight French Terry Shawl Collar Pullover Sweatshirt.<br /><br />Unbelievably, I have owned many different styles and color, I have NEVER owned a Terry Shawl Collar Pullover in my life. SO, when it arrived this morning, I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to put it on and see how it fits.<br /><br />For a review point of reference, and to better help YOU select the right size - IF you decide to get one after reading my review, here's my measurements. Please be aware, I am carrying ~ 10 lbs quarantine weight which I'm sure I'm confident that I will lose it once I resume my pre-COVID-19 workout routines.<br /><br />  Height: 5'9""<br />  Quarantine Weight 155 lbs / Normal Weight: 145 lbs<br />  Fit Preference: ""Comfortable"" fit - ie, neither too snug (uncomfortable) nor too loose (too casual, not my style)<br /><br /> Becauese I prefer a ""comfortable"" fit, and this includes the sleeve lengths don't run too long past my wrists necessitating rolling the sleeves up creating a 'bulk' at the wrists, I do NOT want that situation; so I ordered a size small (see photo). In preparation to getting back to post-COVID-19 work normalcy, I paired with one of my favorite desinger brand slim fit stretch slacks so TOGETHER I can see how the Terry Shawl Collar fit and look on myself. NOW, like most people, another issue is I desperately needed a haircut, if I can look decent now, I should look much more presentatble when I get that haircut. So, from the photos, I'm very pleased with another new style look that I've never had - the Terry Shawl Collar. As well, because it's made of 100% cotton, it's comfortable, but the facbrics is a litte heavy for my taste. I would have preferred if the fabrics contains some sort of stretchable fabrics (just like my slim fit slacks) like Elastane, even at 5%, this will make this pullover sweatshirt that much more fitting as it stretches to fit my body contours better, and also much more comfortable. Come returning to work on Monday, all I have to do is slap on my blazer coat, and I will look Silicon Valley's Casual Dressy dress code, hey, I think I may even stand out amongst my male colleagues üòÉ üòÑ üòÖ  I also love the kangaroo pocket, again, by choosing a ""comforable"" fit dress style, this kangaroo pouch pocket won't become a BULGE, I'd look funny having a coat or blazer on top. The delicate ribbing at hem and cuffs are also a pleasant prize for its execellent stitching job. Of course, it's machine washable, preferrably in cold or lukewarm water - definitely hang dry, or this 100% cotton fabrics WILL shrink!<br /><br />In summary, it's a great look that I really do enjoy - the Terry Shawl Collar; I am still missing a Cowl Collar in my wardrobe set - that's next in line to add. So, if you're looking for one yourself or your family, I'd high recommend it as long as you choose the RIGHT size. Now, I can't emphasize enough, you need to decide HOW you are going to wear it. IF you want to wear it on OUTSIDE by itself, ie, without adding a coat or blazer, then you can order a larger size - as you're pretty much wearing it like any other hoodie, except without THE hoodie but a Terry Shawl Collar. IF you DO want to wear something over it, I'd suggest that you, like I did, order one a size down (from your regular hoodie), then you will look SHARP - now which man doesn't like the sound of that!<br /><br />BUT, in all, this is a very comfortable, fitting and pretty good looking no frills everyday sweatshirt.<br /><br />üíûüíìüíØüí™üëç HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDüëçüí™üíØüíìüíû"
4.0,I have had a pair of these for 10 years and have used them for everything outdoors. I even used to to  clean my stove pipe. That got them dirty. I have left them out in the rain and I have left them out in snow where the froze.<br />I am still using them though. In areas they have worn though. The inner fleece is not what it was. They are still great mittens. These days I wear jersey gloves underneath for added warmth. I have a new pair on order which I will be kinder too. I am not throwing away the pair I have now. I only give 4 stars because I had a better pair of mittens 40 years ago
4.0,Pretty swimsuit and good quality!  Fits well but the bust inserts could have been thicker and bigger.
4.0,"They run small but will stretch with time, mine work for me because I‚Äôm not wearing thick socks with them."
4.0,Cute for fall but definitely see through so you‚Äôll need a slip. Fit into the xl at 37 weeks pregnant!
4.0,"Cute! Very lightweight, easy to put on, and a fun way to liven up any plain top. Only drawback is the gold/mustard and white/off-white are very close in color. I'll use those duplicates as stocking-stuffers.."
4.0,This will defiantly keep you warm... many configurations for if you get too hot wearing it.
4.0,"Stretchy, easy to put on.  Good price for fau vintage look."
4.0,My husband really liked these for his birthday. They were very well made and not overpowering in size.
4.0,"Great dress, was a bit large for what I was expecting. Got a medium, am 135 5'5&#34; 36D and am going to shorten the top to make it fit my waist better; wanted the dress to be large enough for my bust, which it is, but the torso is a little long. The added length in the torso makes it long for my height, but that should be fixed when I take in the torso. Great for taller gals as is, I will need to adjust it but I bought leaning on the larger size since you can always take in but you can't add."
4.0,Nice quality! Perfect for monkey bars addictedü§ô
4.0,"Definitely more of a pink color than purple. Holds up well - but I will say, where the end crosses and latches in, it has created red marks and irritation on my skin. I‚Äôve tried airing it out and cleaning it but it still does the same thing. Still a good price though!"
4.0,"Really nice, but Very large."
4.0,Not what I expected but my fianc√© liked them a lot. They are tiny to me but again my fianc√© liked the size.
4.0,"I purchased this in a Medium to wear as a long shirt instead of a dress.  The length (as a dress) looked too short for my comfort level.  As a shirt, however, it's very cute.  I did at a belt to cinch in the waist, as it is quite big.  The material is a nice weight, and can be worn comfortably on cooler summer days, as well as all other seasons.  I received quite a few compliments the first time I wore it and it was very comfortable.  My reasons for 4-stars are that the elastic (on the wrists) was fairly tight and became a bit bothersome after a full day at the office.  The second reason is that I could not wear this without pairing it with a belt which I already had in my closet.  I realize this is meant more as a dress than a shirt, hence the reason to not include the belt, but, for my purposes, it would've been nice to have a belt."
4.0,I got this as a gift and haven't given it yet. It's a very cool ring though.
4.0,My 8 year old loved these for about 2 weeks - he was teased a bit by his older friends unfortunately. Good deal for the price - lights are cool.
4.0,The color was just as in picture I ordered a Xlarge and it fits great
4.0,"The sweatshirt I received was very warm and felt nice. It's quite thick, though that may make it less than ideal for certain athletic uses. However, the XL seems to be larger than a XXL with other brands, so keep that in mind when buying. It also had a very strong chemical scent when I received it, so definitely make sure to wash before wearing - though that's fairly common and washing is recommended with any clothing purchase anyway."
4.0,VERY CUTE AND SOPHISTICATED. IT WAS A BIT LONG AND SINCE I PREFER SHORTER NECKLACES I JUST SAT DOWN TOOK SOME LINKS OUT THEN PUT  A CLASP ON IT AND IT FITS JUST THE WAY I WANT IT. ITS SO TIMELESS AND JUST LOVELY.
4.0,"Nice, stylish dress. My only complaint would be that the material is a little bit heavy for a summer dress."
4.0,"This was absolutely perfect for a recent trip overseas. It fit three passports some credit cards and cash, my iPhone and one lipstick. It was my wallet for the majority of the trip and my clutch for two of the weddings we attended. I docked a star because the strap does come off the snaps too easily, but I didn‚Äôt use it with the strap much anyways."
4.0,"Runs true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 116.  Usually wear a small, but saw that others said it runs small so I ordered a medium.  Had to send it back and get a small. Material is super soft, but a little see through."
4.0,"This is a super cute set, and obviously quite trendy at the moment. I love that these can be worn together or separately. I bought them for my son, but I feel like this set is pretty gender neutral.<br /><br />I love the little harem pants. They are definitely very on trend at the moment, and there are other brands that would sell just the pants for more than this set costs in total.<br /><br />The quality of these is quite good, and I love how soft the fabric is. The tshirt is very, very soft and almost buttery.<br /><br />I would say that these fit a little bit small, so order up a size. Especially given that babies grow so dang fast!!<br /><br />I would recommend these to buy for your own child, or as a gift to someone else. Because I believe that they are gender neutral, I think you could buy these for a boy or a girl.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,fits nice. not big around the armholes which is usually the case with summer blouses.
4.0,A little snug. One size fitsmost is right. Hopeit stretches out a bit.
4.0,"These were a hit with the kids, but the plastic is brittle and breaks easily."
4.0,Design is adorable and I want to buy more. But my 2 month old could only fit in the 3-6 month size for a week. I should have bought the 6-9 month size at least. The material is cotton and not very stretchy.  Since it's cotton it did shrink A LOT when put in the dryer. I recommend buying at least 2 sizes bigger.
4.0,The barbell is a bit shorter then expected but they still fit nicely. They do look a bit cheaper in person but I didn‚Äôt expect great quality for the price. Good value for your money
4.0,Fit pretty nice
4.0,"So I bought this to help me wake up in the morning cause I really like sleep and over sleeping. It's helped me wake up to my alarms in the morning, even sometimes before my alarms. The only thing I wish was that this was programmable for the alarm without the app, the app keeps asking to save media files on my phone and I don't want to, cause this is just an alarm wake up aid. I could care less about the courses available honestly. If it wasn't for the weird app not just being another type of alarm it'd be a 5 star to me. I also wish that there was a type cloth covers for the arms of the wrist band parts."
4.0,ok quality. These get the job done and the for price they are pretty good. I like how long they are. I use them for snowboarding on snowy windy days and it does a good job at keeping me warm and my face protected.
4.0,"I really like the satchel. It is large enough to hold all my stuff with easy access. However, when I ordered it I thought it was a concealed weapon purse. It is not, but I like it anyway."
4.0,"Not a bad bracelet for part of my wife's Christmas presents, I'd buy it again. It was a great addition with the others I had gotten for her."
4.0,"Really like this nightgown. The material is super soft and stretchy, perfect for lounging and sleeping. I wish the collar was a little bigger, but I know that‚Äôs just my preference."
4.0,"Super cute, but is very clingy. I am a very fit person, but it was still quite right around the middle."
4.0,The skirt fits great I'm 5 5 asks 157lbs love it.
4.0,"I love the way they look, this is actually my second pair because the back fell out of my first pair. So that might be a negative or I was just unlucky and didn‚Äôt screw it on well enough. They‚Äôre actually small for my ears which are gauged at 0g. But that could just be my own problem also. Anyways all in all they are one of my faves. I‚Äôve gotten compliments on them. üòä"
4.0,"The dress is made of a heavy polyester not a silky material. The color is exactly as pictured (I bought the blue). The fit was great. I listened to the reviews and bought a size bigger than I needed and it fit great. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Fun pattern, runs a bit snug for an XL"
4.0,Beautiful jewelry! Smaller than I expected
4.0,"This dress is okay. I ordered it for my graduation night but it was my second choice dress (my first choice would arrive too late). I am 5'4 and weigh 105lbs so I ordered the small, and it fit decently, but it was a little too big at the top around my chest area. I didn't love the length for everyday dress, but my school required our dresses to be below the knee so this dress was perfect for that! It hit just below my knee. This dress is a nice, soft, thick material and very well made, just a little larger than expected."
4.0,"Good Watch, Thanks."
4.0,I always loved the haunted mask goose bumps episodes. So I had to get this mask.
4.0,This was a gift and she loved it! Brighton always does a nice job.
4.0,"Adorable dress! The only negative thing -&#62; it is a bit see through up top, but wear something underneath and you will be fine. The dress is a bit longer then pictured as well, but still VERY cute :)"
4.0,"I adored the style of this costume.  I would just say, adding the white paper to the black print, is not a good idea, It stick to the print.  Overall it is a very nice costume."
4.0,"A little too suntan for me, but the size was right.  Thanks."
4.0,like it . great for hunting
4.0,Needed this for my toddler who wanted an Anna dress for Disney on ice. She says it‚Äôs a bit itchy and it‚Äôs a bit much to put on but once on it fits so well and is super cute! She didn‚Äôt wanna take it off. Don‚Äôt know how it will hold up cuz we‚Äôre saving it to wear to the event but first impressions were good.
4.0,Daughter lives these shirts
4.0,It's a bathing suit
4.0,I absolutely love the look of these. They're just so thin and fragile that I almost don't want to wear them. Just accessory for pictures not for actual everyday wear.
4.0,Fabric much thinner than I expected
4.0,It‚Äôs a see thru fabric...it‚Äôs very thin. Like very! It‚Äôs also very long. But fabric looks like it was cut and never seamed together. So it can be cut and then hemmed? I wore with my leggings under and boots. It served it purpose for the occasion I needed it for. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy another.
4.0,"Nice, pretty good quality! Fits a large head - pro or con depending on person!"
4.0,Beautiful.  The flower I had to gorilla glue it to the shoe.  The clips fell off. That's why I rated 4 stars
4.0,"I'm a medium (narrow shoulders, 36D, 28 waist, 5'2) and purchased a medium- the fit was perfect. Nothing fit too loose or snug. The positioning of the snap at the cleavage area is perfect for me- no big reveal nor did I feel trapped. The dress fell at the top of my ankles, which is what I hoped for. Pattern is cute and springy; material is not cheap, thin, or see through; stitching is good. I'll get good use out of this dress as I plan to make it a staple in my spring/summer office wardrobe."
4.0,"Update: The seller responded promptly and offered a replacement. Hopefully the new one will have a stronger zipper.<br /><br />Original Review: Used this cover for one flight and the zipper was destroyed.  It is no longer usable because the zipper is the only thing that holds the cover on the suitcase.  It is a cheap plastic zipper and does not seem durable enough for airline travel.  It is a shame because the material is really nice and it fit my large suitcase snugly, but it needs a stronger closure method.  I am waiting to hear back from the seller to see if they will replace it so I can give it one more try - maybe I just got one with a bad zipper."
4.0,Fit as expected but was a little large under the arms had to get it altered which only cost about $30. so it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Still a great deal overall. Would deff recommend!!!! (I added the belt it did not come with the dress)
4.0,"Really cute leotard but the stars fall off. I haven't even washed it yet, afraid they would all fall before her first time wearing it. I will update after washing. However, it is still adorable with or without stars, just keep a broom handy."
4.0,Nice looking and functioning watch it looks as it cost more than it did. However you do get what you paid for and I got exactly what I expected and I'm happy to add this to my collection
4.0,A little small but nice overall.
4.0,"It is very warm, it is a bit masculine.... I may buy another as a gift!"
4.0,Did not really like the length or how big the lapels were. I didn't notice the velcro when I bought it. Will not buy again. But only because it was not what I was looking for.
4.0,Said they were slims but looked real large still. Couldn‚Äôt tell difference between them and regular sweats
4.0,My girl is very much petite so I hoped these would be small being sized 2t-4t but they are slightly too big. Very well made and soft she loves them.
4.0,"I bought the size M and I am 5'9"", weight 177 lbs. The shirt fits just right with the exception of the chest area where it is a little tight. I would probably try the size L for my next purchase."
4.0,"Fits just like I had hoped!! Only wish that it was adjustable. Otherwise, 2 thumbs up!"
4.0,Fine as expected
4.0,". . .and I'm enjoying it.  The fit is true to size.  Can't say anything about fading in the wash yet, as it's only been worn a few times, but the quality looks good and it seems to be worth what I paid."
4.0,Bought size Large and it was tight. I'm a size 8 and have never worn an XL.  This is a pretty red dress so I  returned the large and got an XL. If you are curvy you have to go 2 sizes up!
4.0,"Just got it today and it appears to be very good quality, better than I expected. Based on reviews I ordered a size large and it is big but I‚Äôm pretty sure medium would be too small.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 125 pounds, 34 d, big bum, usually wear a six. And it‚Äôs very long. I think I‚Äôll keep it but I will have to hem it- It comes down to midcalf length and I wanted something above the knee. Nice plus‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs lined. May have said that in the description but I didn‚Äôt catch that."
4.0,"I bought this for my son to use as a backpack. After six months, the straps had ripped as nd I had to purchase another backpack."
4.0,I like it a little longer and baggy so I ordered a 3x. It's soft and light weight something I'd wear in the fall or spring.
4.0,Cute boots for the price. I‚Äôd recommend one size bigger they seem to be very sung with the fur and socks.
4.0,"Per the manufacturer's suggestion, these run small.  I ordered the green camo pattern in XL.  The pair I received has a tag that reads, &#34;XL 34-36&#34;.  I'm a 32&#34; waist and these fit my waist, legs, butt perfectly.  The pouch comes with a weird removable &#34;modesty&#34; pad installed, kind of like a padded bra, but it doesn't leave room for, well, me.  I immediately removed the pad and now everything fits properly.  Plan to use these during private tanning sessions, but see how they'd make good swim trunks if you rock speedos.  Drawstring style waistband."
4.0,"Took a while to get here but it was somewhat worth the wait. I love the design on the back and the sleeves hang nicely. The only problem is, is that the waist is a bit short. I ordered a large and was expecting it to be a bit longer but it wasn't. I'm short so that's not that big of a problem for me. But for tall ladies it could be a bit annoying."
4.0,"First of all- they didn‚Äôt make my butt look bigger. I do have a nice, bubble butt. I will add!<br />However, they fit me well- I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4.5‚Äù 123lb small waste, long legs, and the small fit me great! They are also very comfortable. I have yet to workout in them, but I can say they were nap/lounging approvable!<br />Overall, I‚Äôve given them a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. 4 stars because I didn‚Äôt feel like it really made my butt ‚Äúpoppin‚Äù like everyone‚Äôs talking about! However, they do look good. And they are comfortable and I‚Äôm surprised by the thickness.<br />I definitely wouldn‚Äôt mind getting another pair in another color. I got the gray and I like them :) I like the color."
4.0,"Like the style, for the price is acceptable but it is extremely cheaply made."
4.0,"Arrived on time! Love them! The dangling coins are plastic not metal, but overall really nice"
4.0,"This is a fun, professional sweater that I can wear at work and feel modest. Love the mint color."
4.0,It was a little small but fit like a bandeau. I am a 38C and I ordered a medium. Still room to breathe
4.0,price could have been lower but pretty
4.0,"I considered returning them as the strap doesn‚Äôt feel great, but decided to keep. I just won‚Äôt be able to walk long distances in them."
4.0,It doesn't feel like or look like chiffon.
4.0,thin material but for the price it's perfect.
4.0,"It‚Äôs good quality but I was expecting better from pictures. It‚Äôs always hard to buy clothes just on picture, it‚Äôs always a little disappointment"
4.0,They run small but are very cute! My daughters foot pops out the top sometimes bc they are cut a little weird
4.0,My granddaughter was thrilled with them and so was our dog who sneaks them off to sleep with.
4.0,"They run a little small, but super comfy!"
4.0,"The skirt is functional and cute. The tights stay kit and it fits as expected. The color is not what i expected. It almost looks green. Also, the tights are a light teal and the inside of the pocket is a lime green. The combination diet match and makes the color of the skirt even mote confusing. I wear it weekly to the gym and get compliments on it."
4.0,Not heavy. Good quality
4.0,"This is a nice, soft scarf. It is a very large square so you wouldn't use it as you would a chiffon style scarf. This could be used as a very light lap blanket. You can fold it like a triangle and use it more as a shawl. Wear it under a coat for additional warmth, put it over your head to keep it warm. The possibilities are actually endless! The gray that you see in the picture on the seller page is a large light gray square in the middle and there are darker and lighter grays around it. Over all, a good purchase!"
4.0,"I love this ring. Ring wears well, and is nicely made. Delivered before projected date."
4.0,"The wallet is a unique idea, with promise, it is very difficult to remove credit cards and is rather time consuming it crowed check out lines. More work and this could be a great wallet."
4.0,It was great thanks
4.0,"nice pj's, soft material"
4.0,Sleeves did not go below the elbow as picture portrayed otherwise it is a beautiful dress well made great fabric.
4.0,"Good quality, fits same as her usual size.  The shoes primt and the rest of the outfot print did not match, so ended up using other shoes."
4.0,"Super cute dress, and well-made. The only problem I had was the neck strap is not adjustable and was just too long for me. I could have altered it easily, but didn't want to. It would have been perfect if it had an adjustable neck strap."
4.0,SISTER IN LAW LOVED IT.
4.0,"This is a nice belt.  The heart was a scratched just a little, but for the price, I would still recommend."
4.0,"The feather fell off almost immediately, but it's still a pretty necklace without it."
4.0,"I haven;t had a chance to wear them yet, but I don't anticipate any problems.  The gloves are soft and comfortable."
4.0,"It's pretty, and it has plenty of room for your credit cards, bills, and change.  it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.  It's almost too big for my small purse.  Shucks, I guess that means I'll have to go shopping for another purse ;)"
4.0,"I purchased this for my size 18 / 2 XX body as a size 5 X, after reading reviews. The light flowy over jacket is nice and fits fine. The dress is very pretty, maybe a burnt orange / brown in color, and perfect for fall events. It came in about 5 weeks.  The dress is just too clingy for my body type. I was able to slip it on  over my head, and it fit me, but since I do not wear tighter form fitting clothes, I will have to send it back. Other than that I liked this dress for the price. It is beautiful.  Also it came to just above my knee."
4.0,The dress is made with really soft material which I was worries about . It did shrink a size when I washed it so you might want to order a size up and wash it first before you wear it . I didn‚Äôt do that and wore it right out the box to work and it was fine . After washing it and putting it on to wear to work I realized it was too short of wear to work.
4.0,"Pretty belt, love the way it looks. I like to wear gold belts around my waist to cinch dresses, and my old one had worn out. I like that this one is fully adjustable. The only downside to that is that it is really long when I cinch it around my waist, but that happens to me a lot with belts. I use a clear hair rubber band to hold the extra in place around the side, and that works fine."
4.0,Runs small bought XXL and fit like a size medium
4.0,"The pros and cons of this guitar strap:<br />* Solid heavy, high quality leather and stitching<br />* A half inch wider than most other straps<br />* Well made, good quality that will last a lifetime<br />* Great value for the price<br />And now the cons:<br />Basically it doesn't look like the picture. The leather is very stiff, not a big deal but the picture looks like the leather is very broken in and supple.  The biggest drawback for me is the color is not even close to the picture.  Mine is a generic medium brown with a moderate amt of dye that makes it look a bit ""distressed.""  The strap in the picture has a much darker, deeper, greenish color and worn look.<br /><br />Summary:  A high quality strap at a great price but very disappointed on the appearance which was the major motivation for my purchase :-("
4.0,"good quality, strong secure closure"
4.0,Very please. Prompt delivery. Great gift.
4.0,This top is a little more ‚Äúfrumpy‚Äù than I though it would be. Nevertheless still very cute!
4.0,I purchased this skirt for my daughter.  It looks really nice on her and I like the fabric. Only problem is that the waist band rolls and twist itself throughout the day. She said it gets uncomfortable and she hates having to adjust it throughout the day
4.0,True to size but the arm part ripped as I was trying it on. I ended up taking the other side off and wearing it as a strapless top still cute
4.0,Me encanta me anuncia todas mis notificaciones
4.0,"At 5'3&#34; and 140#, I wish I'd ordered the small.  I'm returning it since I had to buy a dress locally at the last minute.<br />It is a very nice dress that doesn't cling to the body. The quality is great and it has enough stretch to be comfortable.  The belt is stretchy and not adjustable; it seemed to ride at least an inch above my natural waist.  I ordered a &#34;poufy&#34; slip to wear under it, but that makes me look like I gained 50 pounds.  The skirt part is heavy enough to fall around the body nicely without any need for a slip. Getting the wrinkles out and the pleats pressed will take some time since this material wrinkles easily."
4.0,"The color was off. Not the dark navy blue shown but more of a royal blue. Also the sizing was a little off. Had to order a smaller size then it still had to be taken in. Luckily, we had time considering this was a bridesmaids dress. Good quality dress otherwise."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 165 lbs and ordered these in a XL<br />I wear a Medium in the infamous old navy flannel pajama pants but I already knew Amazon sizing, I needed to size up. Glad I did, was hoping they‚Äôre be more ‚Äúgoing outside‚Äù pants but they‚Äôre definitely pajama pants. A little more rough feeling than old navy pajamas but they‚Äôre nice"
4.0,"fits great on my lower half! I gave it 4 stars because it does not have belt loops and I NEED belt loops. Fits great everywhere but my waist, just a little loose so therefore I would need a belt....I am 5'5&#34;/130lbs with a booty.."
4.0,This is s really nice-looking band. I received many compliments on it. Very easy to size using included tool. Well packaged.  This is my second one. I wore the first one almost daily for a little over a year. All of the crystals stayed put but the plating on the inside of the band was beginning to wear off.  (Thus the 4 stars.). But I liked it so much I ordered a replacement anyway. Can‚Äôt beat the price for something that looks this good!
4.0,A reasonably sturdy belt that you don‚Äôt have to take off at airports.
4.0,I love the softness and comfort.
4.0,"I like how it gave my crochet hair style room to flow freely. The hair length was 10"" and it didn't get bunched up. This bonnet really allows room for hair to breath. Sorry I didn't think to take pics. I hope this helps!"
4.0,"I bought it for a St. Patrick's Day party and it fit the bill. As others mention, it is thin, but that was an advantage in my case.  It is comfortable and attractive enough for the price."
4.0,Nice style. Good value.
4.0,Its a very pretty dress but not the best fitting for someone with a larger chest. Also very tight on the arms. It fit everywhere but the girls. My refund came very quick so I could get something else in time for my party.
4.0,"I bought these because they were advertised as being polarized. They are not, however, I will keep them because they are cute."
4.0,Purchased as a gift. They were very excited to decorate their crocs.
4.0,Nice quality.  A little snug.
4.0,"So far, so good.  Looks in pictures like a Figaro link, but it's really not.  Great for the $, not sure if it will last, but I hope so."
4.0,These arrived on time and are a very good quality.  I'm happy with both.  The only reason I did not give a 5 star is the silver is replacing a pair of silver shoelaces that have worn out.  My original pair are more sparkly than these and I loved that about the old pair.  I love sparkle!  These are good though and will definitely keep them.
4.0,Cute and fun.<br />Odd fit.<br />The shoulder cut out is very large. Wearing off the shoulder hangs way down.
4.0,I would have given 5 stars but the idea slightly differs from the one in the photo. The one listed shows white with black and red . Mine was just black and white. That aside it‚Äôs a great piece of art and addition to my drum room
4.0,Love the socks they fit great! I wear an 8 1/2.
4.0,Cute and as vendor described.  Order up a size.
4.0,"They are wonderful and silky, but they need to come in a petite because I am walking on the bottoms.  But they are keepers and I will deal."
4.0,"I wear a size 8 and this dress is XL...for $20 bucks, a good deal"
4.0,"Exact same product is in the funeral home catalog for $200. $200! It's stainless steel! Charm is large and heavy, not an every day piece. Simple design. I can't quite get the screw to lay flat again not that the ashes are inside. I like it though, and a super bargain."
4.0,Very nice . The size small was just right for me!  I would like to buy more!!
4.0,It gives. Definitely snatches waist only problem is it staying in place
4.0,"Good pants, my only recommendation would be to buy a size larger. I purchased these for my son, his size on all other pants is a 28 waist. These pants did not fit him at all. Luckily my other son needed a pair and they fit him just fine. One size up would be my recommendation.<br />Quality: Great<br />Durability: Great<br />Comfort:  Great<br />Price: Comparable to other brands."
4.0,"I receive many compliments when I wear this dress. I am only 5'1, so the dress was very long on me, which I expected. The only thing I dislike about the dress is that there are a couple of barely noticeable stains on the top. I hadn't noticed them until I hemmed the dress and wore it to work."
4.0,"I like the looks and material of this dress, but fits small.  A good value though!"
4.0,I bought this for my niece she loves pink doughnut so far it looks wonderful I just hope she likes it I love the little bag came in makes it look adorable
4.0,Cute dress. Fits true to size. Not a sweater though...more like a lighter long Johns material.
4.0,"Love the material and the height of the heel, but my size 10 felt more like a size 9. Returning for a size 11, hoping those fit better."
4.0,"This bra was bought for my jump rope and rebounding sessions.  As a larger girl my girls need the taming.  This bra is perfect.  It's cheap, it holds the girls in place, and it dries out quickly.  My only complaint is that the inserts were stiff.  I ended up removing them."
4.0,"I liked that the visor fabric was soft and the elastic was not restrictive. The fabric seems to be of a good quality as does the construction. The visor is not too deep, which I prefer; there is less of a ""closed in"" feeling. It is a tiny bit tight on my head, but that may loosen with time (I've only worn it once)."
4.0,"My girlfriend and I wanted to spice it up, so we tried ordering this. It‚Äôs a very light weight and doesn‚Äôt feel like much but will do the trick to experiment a bit"
4.0,Comfortable and true to size.<br />Not cheap thin material either.<br />Worth what I paid .
4.0,Fit perfect! Very cute sandal.  BUT i took away a star for the non grip bottoms.  Beware it‚Äôs very slippery. Might have to scrape bottoms over concrete to give some traction.  Other than that üëåüèæüòâ
4.0,"The bow on the front was held on by only a very unsightly safety pin, which looked quite tacky as it showed when the dress was put on. I added a couple stitches to hide it and it looked much better. Other than that, it looks very nice. My girls feel like princesses."
4.0,good cheap sunglasses
4.0,"Very light, but seem sturdy.  Time will tell."
4.0,"I LOVE the size (ordered extra large) and that the zip pocket is separate from the snap pocket. I like to be able to get my cell phone out without opening up my entire wallet. Now the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.... the zip close does not close all the way/slightly insecure. I put a tiny carribeaner clip on i. And, there are only 2 slots on the inside of the zipper part.  Not enough pockets - I was expecting more.  Other than that, meets my needs for the cell phone (moto x 4 with a whole case on it) fitting perfectly in the snap outer compartment."
4.0,The outfit fit my wife (normal size 12 -14) but was a little tight.  Would have liked a little more room for comfort.
4.0,I love the color and the shape but a x-large isn‚Äôt a extra large. It gave a larger measurement for the bust area but it isn‚Äôt correct. Hopefully I can wear a cami under it.
4.0,"Aside from color being a bit lighter than I expected, it is a nice formal set."
4.0,"Very nice product for the price. Was pleasantly surprised of the quality, and very attractive design."
4.0,Cute but a bit thin. Great for the use i had in mind but wont hold up over time.
4.0,"Overall great product for the price. The chain is extremely thin, but this was not an issue for me as I already had a chain I wanted to use for it. The gem exterior is flawless. When you hold it to the light there are a few imperfections, almost look like small fissures, but they haven't compromised the stone."
4.0,"I ordered this top in a different color in the past,totally love it,so I reordered 2 more and they were not the same style as the pic or last shirt, these 2 came in longer no peplum waist and equivalent  to a mini dress..ugh..not going through the hassle to return these and probably  get the same thing..again love the style and quality, but mfg.need to pay more attention  to what they are shipping..a little disappointed. .should be the one in this pic not the dress style,"
4.0,Bought for my father as a Christmas gift and he seemed pleased with the quality and colors.
4.0,I received the item on time and in good condition. It came with a cute pair of hanging earrings free of charge. Both pieces are nice and complimented my outfit. Hopefully they will last a while.
4.0,Good quality but was very large. Ordered a large shirt was as big as a 2x
4.0,"Great price, very cute, not organic cotton as advertised. Tag on the bag specifically says ‚Äúmade in China 80% cotton 20% polyester‚Äù. Still adorable and going to keep, soft and good material. But had originally purchased thinking it was a deal on org cotton hats and it is not that."
4.0,"Read other reviews and bought 4-6T for my 3.5 years old. They are just slightly big, with room for growth. 2-4T would have been too small.  Good quality for the price."
4.0,"Overall, this is a great dress! I love how it fits.<br /><br />Mine did have a slight manufacturing flaw though. There were stitches through the bottom part of the zipper, sewing it shut. I could not fully unzip the dress.<br /><br />However, I could still get the dress on. It might cause problems for others though, depending on your body type."
4.0,the design was a good size and it was true to the picture. It was a little bit tighter then expected but over all very happy & will be wearing it a lot!
4.0,Cute.  Wish it was a bit longer (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù).  Confused about conflicting care tags (see pic).  1 says do not dry clean & the other recommends it?!?!?  One shows ok to iron & other says no ironing?!?!?!?  Worried about ruining it.
4.0,The material is great for the spring and summer. It fit me perfectly. I am a true medium.
4.0,These look just a pictured.  They are very delicate and lightweight.  Only time will tell if they hold up well.  For now though they are fine and you can't even tell that they are on your ear.  Not sure if someone with &#34;thin&#34; ear lobes would have an issue with them staying on but they stayed on fine for me (and I have thicker ears).
4.0,The back is weird but it is cute and fits as expected. I bought it for Vegas :) served its purpose! Great price!
4.0,I am very happy with this shirt. Great quality and fit. Long enough to wear with leggings. I am 5'4&#34; and it hit just above mid thigh in the front and fully covers my booty in back. I did order a 2 sizes up per the reviews. The only issue is the awful smell when it arrived. I opened the package and the smell was overwhelming. I washed it right away and there was still a faint smell so I dried it in the sun and that helped.
4.0,Roomy and Sturdy
4.0,Elastic flips gets very big stretched out as wear it but most linen pants do gained weight due to meds needed quick pants to throw on these saved me cute rolled up
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how cute and well made this T-shirt is even though it look a tiny bit different than the one in the photo.  I ordered the one with the kitty on it.  The bottom is a little more flared out than it looks like in the picture, but it's cuter that way.  The fabric is soft and doesn't feel like it would bother someone with sensitive skin.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to wash it yet, but if the quality decreased upon washing I will update.<br /><br />One of the first places I look when researching products is the Amazon reviews, so I believe it is important to give fair, accurate and unbiased opinions. So I received these at a discounted price for my fair and unbiased review and that is what you see."
4.0,I absolutely love these sandals but unfortunately I will be returning them because they‚Äôre too narrow for my feet .
4.0,"After a few days of wearing them, they feel so comfortable! I wore them in the rain and it felt like these boots grip to the concrete! Awesome feel of non slip soles. The zipper feels tough like it will never break! Very happy with these boots.<br />Well after wearing them for a while, I can tell you and warn you that these boots are not for snow and ice conditions! They are very slippery on snow and ice. Almost cracked my head when I slipped on the ice. Other than this, the boots are well constructed."
4.0,"Was a bit larger than I thought it would it be, but I still love it!  Glad I purchased it."
4.0,"It is a good sturdy Watchband. When I first fitted it I thought it was too stiff, however after taking it off and putting it on a few times it is much less stiff."
4.0,"I was nervous ordering shoes online because, normally, size 7 is a little big on me when it comes to flip flops, but I read the reviews saying to go up a size and they were right!! I would normally get like a 6.5 and the 7 fits great!! If they were in half sizes, I would have gotten a 7.5!! They are really nice shoes too! I have really high arches and they are great support. I took one star away because I clicked that I wanted &#34;black&#34; and I got white. The picture stayed white on the page so I think there must've been a glitch. That isn't the shoes' fault anyway!! I like the white, too, so I decided to keep them!!"
4.0,"Very cute design, but they damage very easily when scraped on the ground. The straps were quite tight and gave my child blisters around her ankles - they seem to have stretched out more with wear. They were the first pair of sandals for the year, but beware that they will show wear and tear. Good price, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,not quite xxx
4.0,"really like the belt, how it was made. very strong, yet comfortable. i knew i should have ordered my normal size cause it is just a bit loose. am on the last hole but, it will be just fine. pretty sure i will gain some weight over the winter time and during this covid deal...lol. overall i really do like it. may even ordered another one in the near future."
4.0,"The glass is of a high quality. The side shields are well made. The fit is comfortable. Overall, this is a great pair of glasses for wear in bright conditions. My only complaint is that the rubber part that goes over the ears slides off the metal part too easily."
4.0,I now look like John Lennon
4.0,"Great material, perfect camo color and design Great Beanie, just feels too tight on my head as if it's a kids beanie, opposed to its  tittle &quot;Big Boys Beanie&quot;"
4.0,Works well. Shipping good
4.0,"Extremely long, had to cut and hem! However, extremely comfortable. Use them as maternity pants so sized up 1 size and they fit great at 6-7 months!"
4.0,"Somewhat large, have not worn yet but I tried it on and looks good. Would just look better a little more fitted ."
4.0,Elegant product but when washed the stones broke
4.0,"Good hoodie and comfortable, but I thought it would be warmer."
4.0,"Light weight and comfortable, wish the sleeves were a little bigger but overall is a very nice night shirt."
4.0,Adorable dress! The material is good quality but the dress runs small/short lengthwise. We will keep it but there will be leggings worn with this one!
4.0,"So far the only reason I am not giving it a full five stars is because the hat has gotten a bit loose.  I am going to put it in the wash and see if it gets it shape back, if it does 5 stars."
4.0,"This band is really comfortable and easy to put on, which is exactly what I was wanting. The pattern is also very cute. The only thing i can say that's kind of negative is that the coating will eventually wear off and the white of the flowers gets a little discolored. Which doesnt change the quality of the band any."
4.0,The medium fits me (I am a true Size 8) but is a little short for my height 5'7&#34;.
4.0,"Comfortable and light gloves. I purchased for a cosplay and needed green, but gloves are more like neon yellow color than green."
4.0,"These socks seem to be pretty good quality and work as advertised, but be sure to order the correct size. I ordered large based on my shoe size (11), but it was too tight on the calf. I should have ordered extra large. I wore these on a long flight to Europe (multiple layovers) and by the time I arrived the socks had rubbed my shin and calf raw at the top. It took more than a month for the scar to go away. Needless to say, I haven't worn them since. But ordering the wrong size was my mistake, so I still give them 4 stars."
4.0,"I feel in love with this jacket as soon as I seen it. I was very pleased with the quality of it, its made from in my opinion a very high quality strong matterial. It so very soft and plush and beautiful. I have very sensitive skin and this high quality matterial hasn't given me any issues what so ever. This does run a little small but that doesn't bother me to much at all. I'd buy it again even after knowing it runs small."
4.0,"I received many compliments on the yellow color and the ruffles, wrap style.  Unfortunately, after washing it one time, it is now too short to wear as a dress.  I wore it as a tunic with leggings, but I am disappointed."
4.0,"This jacket is great fun. I get complements everytime I wear it. It is lined with a fux silk which makes it very comfortable. My only complaint is the quality of the snaps for closure, they are not terribly strong and mine will need to be reinforced."
4.0,I love these Gaiam sports bras. I use them for yoga or walking. The fabric of the green and pink bra is cotton but I have the gray striped one and it‚Äôs more spandex like and shiny. I prefer the other material to be honest but I like fit and color so much that I kept it.  Makes your waist look super tiny. I am a 32-34 C/D and I ordered the small.
4.0,"Tight fitting. Runs small. Thick material. Very stretchy. Beautiful patterns. I might try again in a larger size. Ordered size large. 5'5"" bust 36B, waist 33"", hips 42""."
4.0,"Beautiful bag that looks exactly as pictured. I like the size and the vintage style. My only issue was the strap broke at the link the third day I had it, but I just super glued it and its been fine ever sense. I would still recommend this purse. I get a lot of compliments!"
4.0,The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the price.
4.0,"The socks are nice, good compression on the calf but very little compression on the feet.<br />May be it is a trade off for easy to put on."
4.0,"I order the product for my wife and it works well. We ordered the grey version and the grey is very dark with a tint of green. I probably would order another color next time. The materials is soft and stretchy. The built in flat is perfect for a quick feed in public. We opted for a 2 times larger size (she is usually a medium, but we opted for an XL) as this product looks to be an Asian/European fit. I would suggest going just 1 size up. Overall, good fit and great functionality. Its a good product for the price."
4.0,love the charms
4.0,quality was good only that the wire around the edge was coming out so i had to return same
4.0,The only problem that I have with this wallet so far is that the card slots are a little small making it difficult to get cards out.
4.0,My daughter loved this retro dress.  The collar is a bit wide but not to noticeable.  Great heavy zipper and fabric - washes well.
4.0,"Other than the fabric being rougher than I expected, or what she's used to, my 5 year old loves these pajamas.  I ordered a size 7 for my 5 year old daughter that's 42 lbs, because I wanted them to be big enough to last for 2 summers.  I love how long the shorts are (right above her knee).  The pj's are exactly like the photos.  Just wish the cotton wasn't so rough.  I've washed and dried and used fabric softener a couple times and the fabric seems better.  Love the design."
4.0,"These are comfortable, like typical Clarks. Fit is as expected."
4.0,Used for my son and his first swim lessons. He didnt seem to like wearing it and did much better in just a swim diaper. :[<br />But the shirt is nice and has cute colors!
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 150 lbs, my chest size is 37"". I normally wear men's small but bought a size medium because of comments saying it runs small. It fits so I agree you should order one  size larger than you normally do. Overall I am happy. The jacket has real pockets and a real button at the neck. I think the jackets is good, I would have liked it a tad longer but that's just me. The gloves are not great but they will work for the few times I'll wear it. The hat is baseball style not trucker style ( no mesh, not as tall). I think the hat is decent quality. For around 25$ I think this set is a bargain. Hats easily sell for 10$ so 15$ for the jacket is a good price. The gloves I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for. I didn't see a lot of pictures so I tried to upload some hoping it helps someone üòä"
4.0,These are super adorable... they were a birthday gift for a little 6 year old fashionista who loves penguins. Bought in two colors.<br />The material is very thin... more of a neck accessory than a traditional scarf function.
4.0,"Not sure what happened during delivery, but the goggles themselves are fine. Case is Crushed."
4.0,Really cute but the flowers are dead so it makes it look a little ugly
4.0,nice glasses. a little 'open' at the bottom of the lens on my face
4.0,"I don‚Äôt know about other reviews but this coat runs just true to size. Ordered a small & yet there are still plenty of room to wear extra layers inside.  However, this is not the right jacket for very cold winter. This is thin & very lightweight. The reason I‚Äôm returning this is because although true to size the arm length is just slightly longer. Probably ok but I want my hands be out of the sleeves with no distractions especially if I‚Äôm holding something. Quality wise is ok as this is made from China.  For the price it is a reasonable coat to wear in the cold season. I tested the jacket to wear in the 20‚Äôs degree c weather. I can feel a little cold. The only warmth I feel is the neck area as it is furred lining on it."
4.0,The colors are lovely as is the material. They do run pretty large. I wear between a xsmall and a small so I ordered an xsmall and they‚Äôre plenty big. So definitely order down a size. My favorite part is that they say ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù in Spanish on the band. Cracks me up.
4.0,My only additional comment to date... the ankle cuff is too constrictive (making it too difficult to put them on).
4.0,Lovely dress just to small in the burst
4.0,"It's a wonderful t-shirt, just a bit snug."
4.0,Extremely Narrow but awesome leather quality
4.0,A little bigger a than i expected and very long. Im 6'2&quot; 195lbs and the shirt almost reached my knees
4.0,"cute, I get lots of compliments on it."
4.0,"O K Quality,"
4.0,"Material is a bit thin, and runs big. But it is cute! I‚Äôm a medium and fits like a large, hoping it shrinks in the wash for a better fit."
4.0,"This is the same as the Maxcatch offered here on Amazon for $20 more. Quality seems fair and the pocket space should be more than enough. I'll add that I am a bigger guy (5'11&#34; 300lbs, 3XL shirts) and this fits me well. Haven't used it yet, so I can't say what it's like in the field but assume it will be fine. Love that the zipper pocket in the back is large enough to fit my 18oz yeti rambler, hot coffee on those cold steelhead (Erie, PA) days is a huge bonus."
4.0,"I love this dress and will have to have it altered. I ordered a medium based on reviews that it runs bigger, I normally wear a large so I ordered a medium...it is still too big, I wouldve been able to order a small for a better fit. A small will be more form fitting, which is what I was looking for, the medium will be perfect for anyone who isn't looking for more form fitting. For reference, I am 5'6 138lbs and 36b."
4.0,"These are cute but they turn your fingers green and grey, but I just painted over them with some clear nail polish and now they are perfect. Hope this helps :) They are also a bit small, I have smaller fingers but if your over probably a ring size 7 these might not fit, even though they are adjustable."
4.0,"Liked that they are built very sturdy, The jewels are nice and big enough to see what they are. Wished there was a way to separate them so they didn't all clash when I wear them. Other than that they are really nice."
4.0,"I liked them just fine, but wish I would have gotten larger ones.  For most the fit would be fine, but it's tighter than I personally care for."
4.0,"It's pretty cute. Figure flattering. I'm usually a Medium but have put on a few pounds recently, so was not surprised when the Large I bought fit perfectly. I was surprised that it's so cotton feeling, had expected it to be a little more silky or satiny, but that's my own fault for not looking. It looks adorable with my new denim vest. The reason I took off one star is because it's a little shorter than I expected, and I'm only 5'3''. Two inches above knee which I usually don't wear something that short but will be wearing with leggings! Also a bit see through so will be wearing a tank top underneath."
4.0,These are super comfy and long (which is good since i have legs a mile long). Only disappointed by the fact that they pilled after 1 wear.
4.0,"Very cute, but larger than I expected"
4.0,I like the feel and style. It looks very upmarket. It was a little looser than I expected especially at the end of the legs. Overall would buy again if price was a little less. Would probably order a medium next time.
4.0,"Well made, lightweight Jute.<br />I like the fit, and the style is OK.  It doesn't quite look like the picture; there is a very small ridge on the top, running front to back."
4.0,Great for games with lots of cards in your hand.
4.0,This dress is good quality but the fabric is a little on the thinner side for working in an office environment. I am 5 feet and dress is 2 inches below my knee. I will return this for a different style.
4.0,The mask is awesome and it's a perfect fit.
4.0,The dress fit my Grandaugther perfect
4.0,"Very nice, thick knitted, winter sweater. I‚Äôm usually a size 8 (medium) in tops and sweaters and ordered up the recommended one size from other reviews. The large sized sweater fits, but it‚Äôs VERY fitted and tight. Flattering, yes. But not the most comfortable when it‚Äôs fitted. It‚Äôs definitely not stretchy, so keep that in mind."
4.0,Awesome I love this item it was actually what I wanted my only problem was it took forever for it's  arrival and also the band was a bit small and cheap but it just got a more cooler band put on it
4.0,Comfortable  and stylish
4.0,Surprisingly good quality considering the low price.
4.0,liked the color
4.0,I did quick repair on a coat lining work great
4.0,I liked it it was to big
4.0,it was what I was expecting but took forever to get here
4.0,"Super cute, but don‚Äôt stay in place when tucking hair behind ears."
4.0,"Very good hat for FL cool morning weather, pulls down just right to keep my ears warm on the morning 2 mile dog walks.<br />ordered two one for me and one for my wife."
4.0,so cute....
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; 155 lbs. and I ordered a large. Pants are hard for me because I carry my weight in my middle and bust but not my legs. So, if I get them to fit my waist they're way too baggy on my long, slim legs. These are of great material in the fact that they do not appear to be &#34;jeggings&#34; like some do. They did stretch a little during the day, but not too much at all. The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is for 2 reasons:<br />1) they are too short. It's fine because I wear them with flats, but they end a few inches above my ankle and are not as slim at the bottom him.  They come out just a little... not an extreme long skinny pant like the photo shows.<br />2) these are beyond high rise. They button about 2  or 3 inches below my bra! I do like high rise for tummy control, but these are much higher than that.<br />I will be ordering a denim pair in a medium size due to the stretching and super high rise to see if they are a little better. Overall, these are great and would definitely order again!"
4.0,Really great for summer.  You will need a robe around company...
4.0,"I love it! Buy only gave it a 4star review cause there is nothing on one side of the chain to stop the charm from slipping off...but other than that!(it still works, don't worryüòâ)"
4.0,".59 cents!!!!! You are crazy to not buy at least 2 pair to keep around for emergencies or for use when you dont want to use your ""more loved"" pair! THIS IS AWESOME"
4.0,"For the price, it was great! It fit well and the print didn't crack."
4.0,Very comfortable and very nice.
4.0,"Adorable dress, but bottom fabric a bit tight around the middle. Pockets on dress stick out."
4.0,My daughter loves her unicorn swimsuit !!!
4.0,"These seem to fit true to size, maybe a tad bigger. They're soft and comfortable, and long enough for me (I'm 5'10&#34;). I got the denim ones and was surprised to find they have a bit of a texture to them - almost like jean material. Not a big deal, and maybe I just missed that in the description. They're comfortable!"
4.0,This necklace is pretty and seems well made. It comes with a felt bag and a box for gift-giving.
4.0,"These beads can be worn as a necklace or used for Buddhist (or I suppose other kinds) prayers. The beads are small, but can be counted when praying one by one provided one pays attention (they are pretty close together). The necklace is light-weight and, thus, comfortable to wear. It is also easy to put on or take off as the band stretches.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it five stars was that I thought the necklace and beads would be a bit larger."
4.0,I wouldn't wear them for a long period of time but they are good for using for trips to the shower. The shape is a little funky and hurts the inside edge of my foot if worn for a long period of time.
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 160 lbs, size 8, 36DD. Ordered a large, dress fit great. I ordered size up due to my chest size. And it was super comfortable and still fitting. I wore my strapless bra, the one with the laces in front and didn't worry about any straps showing. Also, my spanx was helpful.<br />Wore it for a wedding and the dress looked great."
4.0,Fit my 11 year old perfectly. He looks awesome!!
4.0,"Nice looking shoe, but not as much arch support as I like."
4.0,Love the detailing on the sleeve.... Perfect add on to coordinate with my burgundy Pumas or leopard booties!!
4.0,Great quality product but runs quite large - I usually wear and XL and have a bit of room but the XL was HUGE!  Order one size smaller.
4.0,"For reference I am 145#, c-cup, 5‚Äô3‚Äù and ordered a pink short sleeve dress in a Large. The color received is a true pastel pink (was hoping for the color shown as sold) knocked off one star for the color mismatch. Quality overall is well sewn (no loose threads). Zipper back. Adjustable sleeve ties. I plan to wash and air dry as I do not want this dress to shrink.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering a black and another neutral color!"
4.0,I love all the different compartments it has.
4.0,it's ok but I feel like it is going to break every time I wear it.
4.0,Fits great great price
4.0,"Wife loved it, but we got the wrong size. Had to return and order the correct one."
4.0,"Beautiful looking dress from the front. Is relatively shapeless, maybe to accommodate more body variety?, and would certainly look best with a little sharp tailor tweaking."
4.0,"I like this scarf, length is nice. The colors were very light, the scarf is nice and soft. Pretty."
4.0,Loves the style often scars it complements a lot of my clothes
4.0,I gave it a 4 star because the side buttons could be a little easier to feel and push.
4.0,The Joe boxer pajamas ate winter pajamas. That wasn't describe on your site.
4.0,It was much smaller than I expected them to be but still very cute!
4.0,I am slowly trying this. It fits good and is comfortable when I use it.  I am hoping it will help with slimming.
4.0,I had already purchased several pair of this brand of capri's and yoga pants so I was disappointed that this pair did not fit the same. This one runs a little small.
4.0,"Cute and comfy but the quality doesn't match the price tag. The buttons are sewn on haphazardly and aren't symmetrical, and the color is neither red nor pink but more of a coral. Still plan to wear until it falls apart. Bought my normal size and it fits well."
4.0,Cute and cheapish
4.0,"The material and drawstring is comfortable and durable.  The issue I find with these involves the pant to the waist line connection is poorly done and irregular.  This problem is so much that, I consider these shorts to be IRREGULARS.  they should be listed and marketed as such.  Otherwise, an ok buy for lounging or general working out."
4.0,I was spasificly looking for an apron that was treated for oil and water proof. This is not it. I was washing my pots and pans and I got wet under my apron. I had one that was treated. I picked it up a number of years ago. It‚Äôs been misplaced. I got this one as a replacement.
4.0,"Is silky and soft, but the straps are a little short (or my head is just too big for standard fit. Other than that, I like them."
4.0,"Love the Myra bags,  Great bag for  weekend trips"
4.0,"Even going by the measurements this ran small, but quality is great and received tons of compliments was used as part of a pirate costume for Halloween"
4.0,Fanny is awesome everything else is poor quality
4.0,Great and do exactly what it says they will do.  I love them.
4.0,"My daughter liked it, but it was a bit large."
4.0,It actually has a chain that lets you adjust the size. Well that is smart thinking. Overall very impressed. Easy to fix if it does happen to separate. I still like playing with it. It was meant to be for decoration.
4.0,Lil guy loves them<br />A lil on the small side
4.0,It fit a little big
4.0,The skirt I found to be a little larger than expected. It sits on my waist and I still have room. The only problem with my skirt was that the hole in the back for the button was completely sewn shut and I had to manually cut it in order to fasten the button. Other than that I'm pretty pleased with the cosplay
4.0,Wore to Cancun it looked and fit wonderfully.
4.0,Bought these cause they were listed a face masks as well. But they are too small for that and uncomfortable.  For a headband great.  Nothing else though
4.0,I am 5' 2'' and it was down to my knees
4.0,"fit well, material as expected"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a great ring, hasn‚Äôt turned my finger green, hasn‚Äôt broken, looks like the picture, the only thing about it is that it‚Äôs a little small, and seems too stiff to adjust without breaking. But, I think by slowly stretching it out, it‚Äôll fit perfectly. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you have big fingers though."
4.0,"I read all the reviews and settled  on a size 10  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 140lbs. I love the fit, fabric, and Len. It wasn‚Äôt as low cut on me as others have said. Getting it zipped is a huge pain, fair warning."
4.0,The watch face is larger than I would have liked.
4.0,"Great colors.  Sleeves are a tad long (I'm almost 5'9&#34;).  If you are busty, this is a little small in the bustline, but definitely worth the money.  I bought 3 - two were fine, one I had to return because if had two area right below the neckline mid back that were devoid of dye."
4.0,I went by the size chart but it was still just a tad small. Not so much that I can't wear it though. I've received many compliments inn the dress!
4.0,"Small. Order a size up. Cheap material but I expected that bc of the price. Good for costumes, but I don't recommend for a real event. Good value overall."
4.0,Beautiful but the beads are smaller than represented. Also the band and loops do not stay tight and therefore slip off temples.
4.0,"nice, not the quality i expected"
4.0,these bibs are excactly as pictured
4.0,Shirt felt very soft.  I got quite a few chuckles from others seeing me wear it
4.0,Love the colours in this but it slides out of the cover all the time making it difficult to play<br />my words with friends.
4.0,These are really cute considering the price.
4.0,Love the stretch and softness. I wish the shorts were a little longer as they ride up at night.  The fit was as expected.
4.0,I had to return. Sleeves too long. I did like it and very flattering.
4.0,"These were super cute and I liked them, but they were too small.  i measured and ordered the given size, but i couldn't get them on her feet.  I returned them, and ordered the size up, different style."
4.0,"Great princess shoes, size down significantly though!"
4.0,This was a surprise but in good way shirt fit perfectly and the quality of the material was top notch. And it looks great with either dress pants or jeans
4.0,"Looks to be a quality product.  Not produced in China.  Would have given this a 5, but have not had it long and the print materials must be a 3.  Has all the bells a whistles except media.  A little large for my wrist.  It does work."
4.0,"Pros: sturdy fabric<br />Good weight (not flimsy)<br />nice colors/great style<br /><br />Cons: sizing chart is just plain wrong<br /><br />I would have loved to be wearing the workout shorts by COOFANDY. They looked great out of the package and felt well made. Definitely passed the eye test, with smart looks. I really like that the liner comes a little below the short for a subtle 2 tone look.  Unfortunately, I am not wearing them because they 'swim' on me. I have a 36 inch waist and followed the chart and selected a 2XL accordingly. They are so big on me they just about drop to the floor. So, they are much too large based on their chart. Still, if they fit, then you will likely be happy with these shorts."
4.0,Good hat for costume. Kinda itchy though.
4.0,Definitely size up! It's soft and nice. Fleece isn't as thick as my old Land's End robe but it's good for the price.
4.0,Bought to use after cataract surgery -- should work well.
4.0,"Toddler sized, not for baby as I had expected. But still nice for the price"
4.0,The plastic contact tools could be better. But overall üëç
4.0,"I really liked this, except it was so small I couldn‚Äôt get the two pieces to screw together. It was just to difficult. I‚Äôm there use it was a great item."
4.0,"good running shorts. i stayed cool even in the humidity of dc summer. as others have noted, the pockets are very small. i slipped a key ring through the mesh so i can attach my keys when i go for a run, but frankly i wouldn't trust them to stay in without the key ring. it would be nice if they were deeper or had a zipper on them or something."
4.0,"A little big and sleeves for funny. Overall a cute dress, I just don‚Äôt like the sleeve length."
4.0,I love the look of these but they definitely don't help shield your eyes from the sun.
4.0,Looked nice on me!  Color and fit as expected. Not too short either so that was good.
4.0,My father likes these slippers.
4.0,"PROS: Good material, no loose threads, thick but very breathable.<br /><br />CONS: Could be longer<br /><br />I use these as an undershirt for CCW. I wear them under a shirt and tuck them in. They just go past my waist, so I wish they were longer so I didn't have to constantly tuck it back in."
4.0,I'm giving it 4 stars because it fit as expected but the color was a really light blue (I bought the navy blue). No where near navy. If I could buy these in all colors I would. I'm pregnant and have gained a lot of weight and these help me feel better and like I'm covered.
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger and that side pockets would be attached to bag at bottom. I was hoping for More compartments
4.0,"I wasn't sure how these would fit, so I got a XL. Glad I did because the XL fit perfectly when I usually wear a Large in this type of pant. So this item runs small. The only thing that bothered me was that the inner lining was too thin. It did not prevent the sequin from scratching me. Other than that, the pants were a big hit at the event that I wore them too."
4.0,"Runs a little on the bigger side. Next time I will order 1 size down, still they are comfortable with good grip."
4.0,"Not bad for the price, several arrived bent and the metal is flimsy.  Easily bent back in place."
4.0,"This film is set in 1970's NYC, taking us into the neighborhoods of Soho, Tribecca and Greenwich Village.  Melissa McCarthy adds a new dimension to her acting, branching out from the comic roles she usually plays in films and on tv.  All of the supporting cast were equally excellent.  Glad to catch up with this film which I had missed when it was in the theaters."
4.0,"I have asthma, and we have an at risk child to the forever on going pandemic, so we are getting masks still. I wanted to LOVE these ones so much but with the filters in it makes it so thick and heavy I feel like I am suffocating everytime I use it."
4.0,Glasses are good but too dark to use at night for headlight glare!
4.0,"At 4'11'' 104lbs 34C I ordered size small. It fits on top but a bit loose around my waist. I'll have my seamstress take it in on the side and I should be all set. The t-shirt looks great, can dress it up or down."
4.0,They are a bit too narrow but I do wear them. Have great arch support!!
4.0,inseam different on same size pants
4.0,"Ordered the size I would normally wear and it fits like a loose tank. I got several compliments on it and it was comfortable. Like other reviews have said, the bow is floppy, but that was an easy fix."
4.0,Buen acabado general
4.0,"Very cute.  Got it for my nephew for his birthday, and he loved it."
4.0,Cute I'm 190lbs 5' 5 I could've went a size up truthfully it was a little tight around my arms but it still fits... I ordered a large
4.0,"It provides basic protection with a minimal package.<br />The heat molding feature is true and feels great.<br />Additionally, the anti-slip gel in the sleeve helps keep it in place.<br />However, it is not durable compare to traditional knee braces. One fall can leave holes on the sleeve."
4.0,"After two uses it was snagged in a few places already.  The material is a bit unsatisfactory, but it was fun to wear."
4.0,"These were actually a lot nicer than I thought they were gonna be. They are a little hard to put on, but other than that, I am happy with them."
4.0,"Fits a little on the loose side, which I am fine with. The material is shiny, almost like a jersey type feel, which I'm not crazy about. Long enough to cover your backside."
4.0,"This wallet is pretty good! It came nicely packaged, in a box, and just looked high end. I deducted one star because upon closer inspection, there was some weird sticky stuff (like  reminence of a sticker?) on the charm that's on the zipper. Also, I had to get some pliers to squeeze the loop on the zipper shut more, that that the tab on the zipper didn't come off. For the price, this is an awesome wallet!"
4.0,"So far, I like it. It looks good and can't wait to wear it outside.I just like to wear it by itself. I like the top rim so the sun rays are reduced coming in from the top."
4.0,Perfect so cool I am
4.0,Nice pendant...cheap cord.
4.0,It‚Äôs a little big on my ear
4.0,"It fits nicely and provides nice support to my wrists. It feels slightly cool to touch. I like it so far. Pretty nice if you hove irritated skin and don't want to show it to the public, or you don't want to expose the irritated sensitive skin to the strong sunlight. But I wish it did not have the white text logo(?) on them."
4.0,"These looked great, felt good. Fit right.  The toe tounge felt weak and i could tell it was not a durable connection to the base sandle. Not much to the sole for foot support for a sandle. These would be best for light use around a pool/house. Very lightweight design. but i doubt they would last a whole summer."
4.0,Their cute shades & they came in on time.
4.0,"They were not clear on top like advertised, I did like the anti stress coating for long term computer viewing, but I wanted to be able to see when walking so I needed them to be clear on top. Oh well. They were sturdy and cute"
4.0,Great necklacea
4.0,Very nice high shine. Nice styling!
4.0,Amazing and very attractive
4.0,This is a flattering dress. I normally wear an XL but went with a XXL and it works great. I would defined say size up. It‚Äôs a good length.
4.0,Very comfy and soft. They're snug. They look more like women's jeans then men's though.
4.0,"I am 6‚Äô and wear a size 18/20.  This dress is really pretty and the cut is adorable.  Very slimming, just wish it was a bit larger and longer."
4.0,"The leather quality is very good for this price points and I'm overall satisfied with my purchase except for a few issues I'll describe below.<br /><br />First I was a very disappointed with the color, I ordered the black strap and the tone of black is very light almost grayish and not as dark as I expected. I thought about returning the strap but then reconsidered and I'm hoping the leather will get darker as it ages. I was also expecting a bit more from the hardware and stitching, but again if you want something better you'll probably have to pay quite a bit more.<br /><br />I purchased this strap to pair it with one of my lower end watches so I didn't want to spend too much. After debating about returning it I finally decided to install it on the watch and most of those initial concerns faded away, I've been enjoying the strap thoroughly."
4.0,"Winnie the Pooh pillow pet is a great product.  He looks just like the picture!  Very durable product!  Washes well, too!"
4.0,"These are beautiful.  They really sparkle! The only down side to them is the clasp, very big and bulky and it takes away from how lovely they are.  I cut the clasp off and put on some sterling silver ones on you can get at craft stores to make your own earrings.  Fixed and better.  Nice."
4.0,"The bar is a little smaller than expected but it's probably listed somewhere. Average quality and will do the job.<br /><br />If you're just looking for a basic tie clip to hold you over, this is perfect."
4.0,"This is a very nice blouse, very nice quality has a pleated front and is sleeveless. Light weight and perfect to wear for any occasion even a hot summer night. It has a floral pattern and several colors to chose from. I recommend buying this blouse. Even great to wear to work."
4.0,Very pretty pendant.  Love the floral design.  The gemstones are nice & vivid.  Since I like bigger pendants I will be gifting it.
4.0,Already broken you get what you pay for
4.0,"Such a pretty pleated skirt!<br />It fits me great, and looks really nice. It's a little longer than I expected, a little below the mid calf, but not quite ankle.<br />I pair it with a black t-shirt and it looks live I've pulled myself together, except I'm still super comfortable!<br />The fabric is nice, and even though the bottom is left unhemmed it doesn't look unfinished and I have not had any issues with it unravelling.<br />All in all, it's pretty, classy and at a nice price!"
4.0,Well made. Magnetic clasp is helpful when putting them on.
4.0,Absolutely love the design on the mask. Gave the mask 4 stars only because it is not protecting you from Covid. I had to cut open the back portion and add filter inserts to give it a lot more protection. Then I had to stitch it close.
4.0,"Material is thick and cozy, however color is bright red in person. I was expecting a burgundy color. It‚Äôs a knit woven fabric and will probably keep me warm, it‚Äôs okay. Length is a little longer than my other scarves."
4.0,The photo was not what I was given. The colors was darker the advertised and the pattern was different has will has the color.
4.0,"Good shirt, just a little smaller than expected and listed."
4.0,"I dont think the pictures do this jacket justice...it is so much cuter it person. I believe it is thin enough for baby in the carseat, but thick enough to keep warm. I have not tried ot out yet in the carseat, but  i will update this when i do. I sized up so that baby can wear in the winter, and it is correct size for what I ordered. The zipper also has a little teddy bear on it. Zipper seems to be a little iffy, you have to have it just right to zip it up. Otherwise I am glad I went with this one!"
4.0,Nice suitcase only giving it a 4 star because I haven't actually used it yet I'm going on vacation in November so I will probably update after I return
4.0,Like but not as thick a chain as I wanted
4.0,"I wear a size 6 jeans and this only went to the largest hole. If I punched another hole, the belt would have looks weird. Sadly had to return. The buckle is absolutely amazing. The belt needs to be longer. And more feminine."
4.0,Very nice pair of sunglasses.
4.0,I like how easy it is to use and how nice it looks. My only complaint was that the chain was too short. I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a longer chain.
4.0,I really love this skirt. It is a nice and thick material and a good length for wearing in cold months. I ditched the belt it came with and used one of my own and it worked perfect. I gave it 4 stars only because it has pockets (which is great) but the pockets are located directly on the sides and the hips. If you have curvier hips like myself it doesn't look quite as flattering from the front view.
4.0,Gift for a person who travels.  Loves them.
4.0,These seem to work just as I needed
4.0,"Love this purse, very roomy and beautiful color. Reason for only 4 stars is that it came with the strap twisted. It was attached backwards on one end and you can't un-twist. Annoying! Maybe I will try to take the loops apart..."
4.0,fit as per my size and good fitting. Nice cloth
4.0,Like the product. Seems a little baggie around the shoulders ( have narrow shoulders anyway). How ever I do like it.
4.0,Good but it's small. Could have been longer
4.0,"Pretty dress! Runs a little small it seems, but able to work with it!"
4.0,It's fine for its money..
4.0,Fits great and looks great! My only negative is that the material sheds. Not too bad though.
4.0,"It's a nice skirt that will fit up to a size 16, I'd say. It's ankle length and the color is true to the photo. It's comfortable and looks good. Seems well made."
4.0,This swimsuit runs very small.
4.0,"The key ring was delivered quickly and looks to be good quality, but the GTO logo came off the ring it came with it but I was able to add it to the main key ring."
4.0,"Though the Large is a little large and the material a bit thin compared to other hoodies I own, I like the price, look, fit and feel."
4.0,Size was perfect. Nice piece to add to my wardrobe.
4.0,"Cute TMNT slip ons! One star off because they did rub a bit on the inner foot and cause red marks. Now that they're broken in, they are comfy for my daughter."
4.0,"This dress is soft and comfortable for me.  I use is mostly as a swimsuit cover up, so its very casual. I got the blue one with orange and red flower pattern.  It has a kind of empire waist, so if you‚Äôre big on top, it might not fit well.  I wanted to buy another one, but they are all sold out of the patterns i wanted."
4.0,its a little tricky to install but over all I like the band for my watch
4.0,I love it because you get every one and color and one except buying individual ones . Great purchase!!!!
4.0,"Order one size up, but it is well made."
4.0,"These socks are very nice, cashmere which I love.  My only complaint is that they are a little thin for the money.  Nothing like the mens cashmere socks that I purchased.  They are  nice socks."
4.0,"Cute, perfect to hide in our fairy garden so it is less obvious and looks like garden d√©cor."
4.0,"Much better than I expected. The gloves fit well, stretchy, have a sheen to them, and a rich black. They don't stay up around the elbows, so I am not sure what to do about that yet. But I like the gloves."
4.0,Very thin but nice !
4.0,These are better for swimming outside. It is hard to see through them in an indoor pool. Must be how the light affects them. Good otherwise
4.0,It was a gift for young adult and they love them. Nike costed too much.
4.0,I bought the socks to wear at work.I bought these and two other pair.They fit true to size.I am a nurse and I am on my feet for 9 hrs a day.I am very happy  with them.Next time I will try a little more compression because I have had vein surgery in the past.I would recommend them to others.
4.0,"Great grid system; however, I wish the backing was made from stiffer material. I use this for my changers, power and phone cables and the backing has a slight bow in it from the tension of the straps. It is in my backpack most of the time so I don't see it much. Other then that, I recommend. I like the fact that as long as this is with me I know I will never need a cable or charge while I am in the field."
4.0,I purchased this item as an add-on to another Allegra K clothing item (for 10% off) - and I love it. The dress fits as shown in the picture (the belt is included) (I'm 5-5 and 107 lbs). The material is VERY thin and something must be worn underneath it.
4.0,"Watch face is nice, band is too short i have a small wrist but this watch band seems tight for me."
4.0,Both my wife and my daughter loved their two-part Christmas gifts and still wearing after two weeks!  The product is as advertised; soft and cozy but not honeymoon fancy! And the price is right.
4.0,"I am 5'9 and 6 months pregnant. I wanted a dress I could grow into. I usually am a 4/6 and ordered a medium with my bump. the dress is very roomy and flattering. I would get a medium if I wasn't pregnant as well.<br /><br />Caveat is the dress straps are WAY more narrow than pictured. I might cut them and resew to look more like the photos. Either way, I still like and would recommend!"
4.0,Love the watch.  Great quality for a very reasonable price.
4.0,I like my new sunglasses üï∂
4.0,"A little bigger than I expected, but still fit my twins. Very stretchy and have good coverage on the booty. They also can double as shorts under long dresses!"
4.0,"This scarf is VERY long.  It is a beautiful knit, and matches my dress perfectly, but it is enormous.  I didn't check when I bought it."
4.0,soft!  order a size up  for  shrinkage
4.0,My daughter loves this skirt but it is extremely thin so leggings are necessary
4.0,Good value sweatshirt. I like my sweatshirts to be a little on the large size so the fit suits me.
4.0,"Bought this for my niece and they‚Äôre definitely cute for little girls. If you plan on giving these as a gift, you‚Äôre gonna have to get a small jewelry box or something bc the way they come isn‚Äôt exactly pretty. Attached a pic so you could see how they come just for reference"
4.0,"The fabric is as fluffy and luscious as the pictures look! It‚Äôs super cozy and was warm enough to wear alone back to my car after my jacket was wet from snowboarding. I wear it on the couch to watch tv with a blanket over my legs so I feel like I‚Äôm in a whole Sherpa cocoon! I sized Up (I‚Äôm usually small but ordered medium) because i was afraid it was going to fit snug and wanted a more loose cozy relaxed fit. Medium was perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 135 lbs muscular build.  Sleeves ride up a little when the hood shifts around, but when I adjust It, they‚Äôre the right length again.<br /><br />But again, you get what you pay for: the pocket lining is very cheaply sewn. My left pocket blew out in the first use and (luckily) was empty when I noticed it. Nothing I can‚Äôt fix myself, but it happened within hours of being out of the packaging. For $21 (brand name ones are like $80), I‚Äôll get a ton of use out of this so I‚Äôm not complaining in the least. Just want to keep the consumer informed! Looks like I‚Äôm not the only one who had some issue with the stitching either."
4.0,I like the quality of your goods!!
4.0,"The top is a bit too long for me and I have a long torso. Otherwise great!! I love the adjustable straps. The material is very nice! Holding up well anywhere from ponds, chlorine pools, and even the lake! I machine e wash and dry it too"
4.0,Love the item but the color is really a brown if you are interested.
4.0,"very sharp looking! the colors are great, get lots of compliments"
4.0,"The watch is very beautiful, but unfortunately it has no backlight."
4.0,Great color; very nice fabric; good fit!
4.0,"This is a very cute & comfy casual dress--looks and feels like a t-shirt.  Size chart is accurate--note this material is thin, so be honest with your measurements, since a lot of stretch with this material won't look good.  Torso is too short for me;  I wish the bodice was a couple inches longer.  DEEP V-neck;  plan on a camisole (or lots of attention) if you have a larger bust.  I'm 5'8"", generally a size 12, and the XL fit fine.  Unfortunately the short bodice made me look like a cupcake from the ribs down, so back it goes."
4.0,This coat is so pretty. Had to return it too small in the arm area but my arms are my problem area... but it for true too size. Coats and jackets always fit that way on me..
4.0,Good product for the money.  Hanes briefs have been part of my wardrobe for as long as I can remember.  They never disappoint.
4.0,"I ordered a medium and the size was what I expected, the compression liner fits snuggly, but doesn‚Äôt restrict blood. The fabric and workmanship seem very good"
4.0,"Good tank tops. Wish they were longer. I‚Äôm short, 5ft and I‚Äôm wishing they‚Äôre longer."
4.0,"The swimsuit fit beautifully but the color is completely different than pictured.  I ordered the geometric design which is shown as blackish but it's a light grayish blue color.  I ended up returning it for snpruget design.  For reference I'm 5'20, 125lbs with 36C bust and ordered the medium."
4.0,Its good for daily wear. Its lil big but he cab manage it and liked it. Cant compare with crocs but material is good.
4.0,"It's hard to say how I feel about these socks. They're thick and cushiony where it's needed most, and that makes them feel very comfortable to start. Unfortunately, they aren't ""fit for all seasons and super breathable"" as the listing claims; they're actually quite sweaty and too warm for hot summer days - even without shoes. They're cute, look exactly like the picture claims, and will likely be nice to wear in the autumn and winter, but they don't live up to their claims and aren't very useful to me now unless my feet get cold. I'm a little disappointed, but not enough to knock off more than one star since they're still good socks - just not quite as advertised."
4.0,"Like some of the other reviews stated, the ankle strap is HUGE compared to the the rest of the straps. But it did fit and my kid loves them so it's not a deal breaker."
4.0,Smallish. and very pink
4.0,"Picture is a little deceiving, I thought it would have a front pouch pocket but it has two small side pockets. Personally I cannot stand side pockets because my other spiral sweatshirts with side pockets now droop and it looks like I have two pouches that hang below the bottom of the shirt."
4.0,"look cheap, and this trend is getting dated..."
4.0,"Great hat, love scentlok. Only problem is hat does come down to the ears as much as I prefer. A little on the small side. Otherwise would have given 5 stars"
4.0,eye glass protection for my reading glasses while wearing shirts without pockets for them
4.0,"They are awesome. The glasses are nice and dark so that I don't have to squint when I am out in the sun. I only did 4 stars though because the purple is not as purple as the picture makes it seem, but I still really like them."
4.0,My niece loves her new shoes.
4.0,Cute and she loves them
4.0,"I liked the look of these a lot, and was surprised how high quality they were for the price! I also loved the case and the cloth these came with. I did feel like they didn't ""hook"" behind the ears at all, and due to the temples they can't really be adjusted. I was constantly afraid of them falling off. But overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how great these were and would definitely recommend them."
4.0,"It is comfy and pretty, a little long."
4.0,Well the style was great just what I was looking for...but they were actually slightly crooked..good thing they were plastic because I was able to bend them straight..so..
4.0,Perfect for workouts that make you sweat a lot. The tiny holes help air flow.
4.0,I love the material and fit but there was a small tear in the seam of the top.  Not enough worth the hassle of returning it so I stitched it up so I can still wear it.
4.0,"The belts are perfect for littles who struggle with a belt buckle, but I measured both my boys and opted to go up a size. Unless you have a husky child, I wouldn't suggest doing what I did. Both the belts are too big and the Velcro isn't long enough to cover the difference."
4.0,I purchased this for my granddaughter  The fit was perfect.  She loved the dress
4.0,"Well made. Smaller than I thought, but quite detailed. It's easy for someone to understand these are SCUBA/snorkel fins. They arrives fast and I am not disapponted. Looking for the mask cufflinks to match. I'd buy these again."
4.0,"I liked this outfit for a photo shoot of my baby. She was still fitting in 9-12 month/12 month clothes at the time, but on the verge of going into the next size up. I bought the 6-12 month size and it was a bit too small. So I swapped it for the 12-24 month one. That one was way too big. So I returned that one and ended up going with another outfit. It seemed well enough made and cute though for a photo shoot, if you can get the right fit. It‚Äôs hard with such a large age range."
4.0,"the color is nice, as pictured. a little small for me. the additional strap is a great option to use as a cross body bag. (which I do)<br />needs a key hook. decent amount of pockets."
4.0,"It looks very good, and lightweight.. not a jacket to keep you warm but a jacket just to enhance a steampunk look in my case. I recommend it"
4.0,Great purchase and well made.
4.0,Had not worn anti-glare and found it annoying to look at screens with these lenses.  Will use this pair as a backup.
4.0,They are nice but delicate
4.0,I have bought the skirt to different times but almost a year apart they are very good quality the only difference between them is the first one I bought was longer and had more stretch the second one I bought was not as stretchy and it‚Äôs a little shorter
4.0,This beautiful bag is a great value and just as nice as some of my others costing four times as much...great size for me... I really like it!!
4.0,"I put that this vest 'fit as expected', but it was a little small in some areas and a little large in others. I know it's slim fit, but it was just a bit odd (for clarity's sake, I am a woman, so I knew I might have issues with the chest/bust and ordered up a size).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, it is definitely a bit long!"
4.0,good cheap glasses
4.0,I ordered a small for my 13 y/o to wear to a school dance. She's just barely 100lbs...about 5'2&#34; or so. Fits perfectly! The back is lacy and see through so she will have to wear a tank top underneath...again she's just a 7th grader...but it should be just fine for an adult.
4.0,It's amazingly cute for kids and I'm sure it will work for a long tome.
4.0,"I have been wanting these pants with the teal line down the legs for over 6 months because the practice I work at, primary color is Teal. I noticed they were never getting in a regular small or x-small unless it was tall or short. I‚Äôm about 5.7 and decided I didn‚Äôt want to keep waiting so I ordered the x-small tall because I didn‚Äôt want high waters if I ordered petite. Well, shocker they are too long but doable with sneakers. They are so comfy and can‚Äôt wait to show them off when we no longer have to suit up in gowns, face shields, etc."
4.0,I have lost connection with my watch a couple of times because of the design. I still love the look and the feel.
4.0,I like the easy wear & lightness of all 5 lightweight cardigans I ordered. I don‚Äôt care for the side pockets‚Ä¶it gets to bulky & catches on pants
4.0,My daughter likes the texture and the fit of the product
4.0,"I received my Eye Sun Classic Aviator Sunglasses at the end of last week and have been using them for almost a week.  While, the are a little big on my head, I love the weight and feel of them, the material is very lightweight but not cheap.  They look good on and have good protection.  The style and shape of the lens' are great and I love the feel of them.  The case they came is a great case and it is awesome to have to protect the glasses while in my car and my purse.  The cleaning cloth is also really handy.  These glasses were a great purchase for myself and I see myself having them for a long time.  I did receive these glasses at discount."
4.0,"The picture doesn't do justice,  its awesome my bf loves it! Dale jr fan?You will love it"
4.0,"nice ring, cant complain for the price"
4.0,"So, I have ordered these for myself and all of my friends (while shopping on Amazon after having some wine) because they are hilarious. I wish that it has a zipper in the front instead of buttons, because they gape open, but I still think these are pretty great."
4.0,"I bought this dress for a holiday, and it ended up just not being my style. I didn't like the way the flowers looked, and I found the waist to be a little strange for an A-Line dress. It was also a little looser than I expected at the top (and I went with the measurement table.) I think it's a cute dress...it just didn't fit my taste."
4.0,"I thought these would be a little bigger and more of an actual clip (I admit, I didn't read the...well anything before I one click purchased these). They are Bobby pins and I got one gold one and one silver one. Which was fine but I wish I could wear both at once. I know I technically could but God forbid I commit a fashion faux paw and mix the two alloys. Over all, I had always wanted these and now I have them so 10 outta 10 there"
4.0,Fits snug but too snug
4.0,"I like the waist trainer, I just wish I get the smaller size cause I got Medium that's the available they have, it's not that loose for me, it came out okay, with so much excitement to try it on, I just take a picture without noticing my shoe is in the background, Lol.<br /><br />As you can see in the Amazon picture, the bottom looks like a short, mine is not, but overall I like it."
4.0,These shirts fit pretty decent. My only problem with them is they are a tad bit shorter and smaller than I am accustomed too
4.0,"Way to small, ended up giving it to my sister. she normally wears a small, and this large fit her perfect."
4.0,"I knew it was polyester when I ordered it. I would have preferred a blend with cotton,  bamboo or hemp, but it is very soft and I was pleasantly surprised.  I just hope it breaths well in a hot & humid climate. Well worth the price and it arrived promptly."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for! It is a small purse, but that's what I use in the summertime. The shoulder strap is perfect. I like to carry it on my shoulder so it fits at elbow height. Perfect for shopping and vacation when I go into those tight quarters shops. I feel much more secure having my purse tightly tucked under my arm.<br />I do love the zippers on the ends of this purse to hold keys etc. But, I'm not sure I trust it from the zipper falling down and loosing my keys. I wish it was more secure or had some sort of lock or key clip so I knew that I would loose my keys from here. Luckily I have an industrial sewing machine, so I will think of something to make it more secure. That was the only reason I gave it 4 stars, I have to do work on it!<br />Otherwise the quality is good. Nice leather, nice metal clasps. Well worth the price."
4.0,"Nice...It fits a little big but if I get it smaller it will be too small in the bottom. However, It is a nice body suit to erase the bulges."
4.0,It was little bit to long but fit as waist wise. We probly could got a smeller size but this had faster shipping needed it for a Halloween costume and it got here faster than expected so all in all positive!!
4.0,Wish it were heavier material but it's a cute purse.
4.0,"Not African cloth, but cute African print on polyester nonetheless.  Can be dressed up or down.  For the price, very cute!"
4.0,It is beautifully good and hope will last long
4.0,"The color was lighter than what is pictured, but otherwise I love it!"
4.0,It's beautiful! Great purchase and great price!
4.0,"Nice strap for the price. The band itself is very thick, around 4mm. Buckle has a nice brushed finish. The leather is stiff and it'll take a while to break in.<br /><br />One reviewer commented the strap is on the short side. The strap measures around 70/120mm, maybe a hair on the small size. I'd call it medium-small at best.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the band is straight (as opposed to tapered) and the buckle is very wide. It gives the strap a very chunky look, which may not suit some watches. It looks okay on my cheapo sub homage."
4.0,"Beautiful pendant, love to wear it.  The chain length was not specified and it was a bit short for me.  But I really like the pendant."
4.0,This dress was gorgeous and fit well. We returned it only because my daughter didn't like the jeweled band at the waist. I loved that part of it though. So that's just personal preference. It was good quality and proper sizing.
4.0,"I order 3 of these to go with french cuff shirts. 1 is a very tight knot, and looks great. The other 2 were loose as shown in the picture. I would rate them 5 star, but I am upset by the lack of uniformity of this product. The cuff links work, no complaints there, the tighter knot feels like a better quality. All in all they work well though."
4.0,Like the style but upon close review the plastic end tips are too flimsy
4.0,"This top is so comfy.  This is a little big for me but I still wear it. The color was not the  quite what I expected.  Nonetheless.  It is a very comfortable, able to wear with shorts, jeans and skirt."
4.0,"These are great; soft, smooth and no panty lines!! They provide complete coverage in the back and do not ride up. I would give five stars if they were just a smidge higher in front, but that's just me."
4.0,Just about perfct!!!
4.0,Like this a lot.  It's a little smaller than expected but still works well.  The only thing that I'm a little disappointed with is that after two weeks of use I found a few runs in the back of the cap.  It could have been caused by one of my nails but I'm not at all too sure.
4.0,Very cute for the price and fits as expected.
4.0,Great starter glasses for kids. They are a good thickness and comfortable to wear for children.
4.0,"A nice, lightweight skirt for summer.  The buttons could have been a little closer together to prevent gaps."
4.0,"very cute, thought it might be a little bigger"
4.0,My husband loved the colors to match his polo shirts but not easy to change bands and they pop off.
4.0,"I like them. Do they have any sort of tummy hold? No. If you need tummy hold this would not count as tummy hold. I am between a L and XL and I went XL so they fit comfortable on the looser side, but in turn they aren‚Äôt see through, a L on my booty would have been very see through."
4.0,Very cute little product. Only problem was one of his hands where the wheelbarrow attaches is cracked. I will use a little glue to fix it. Other than that- cute addition to my garden
4.0,"It was nice and roomy, pretty color mix as well.  It's very thick as well."
4.0,"Cute little wallet.  Not a whole lot of room in the zippered part, but if you are just running to the store and only need your photo ID and a few credit cards, this will do.  Not sure if it actually blocks RFID, but purchased this on the strength of the reviews that I read.  Hope it does because I have had a few people &#34;bump&#34; me in the past few days.  This came on time, boxed nicely."
4.0,Will make great decorations but not anything I will ever wear.
4.0,"Good quality, medium weight Sterling silver rings. Would have given 5 stars if they would also have done engraving. I had to take the rings to jeweler to have the monograms engraved."
4.0,More white than the khaki/cream color shown. But well made.
4.0,Short waisted but I expected that for the pic!
4.0,"Unfortunately these masks usually come in one size.  This was much to large; the chin was very big, I wouldn't be able to wear them.  However, I had t put a piece of elastic along the chin line and now it fits fine!"
4.0,nice fitting visor.
4.0,"This was so comfortable and I wanted to keep it so badly but the padding provided was horrible. It was too large for the cup size so it was smashed and misshapen. If you plan to remove the padding, its an awesome shirt/bra."
4.0,"nice materials, but a little tricky to attach to the Withings watch"
4.0,Tag says its 100% cotton but it has to be blended with another material. Really like the way it fits. I would buy it again!
4.0,Very happy with this watch !! Perfect for small wrist like mine... matches the description very descent can wear it with any attire overall satisfied with this one!!
4.0,These look great!! However the tip isn't as hard as I'd hoped and they are kind of hard to put on no matter how much we loosen them up. But still my son loves them! I love them because the color is so shiny and bright I can always tell where he is on the field! Hahahaha they are beautiful cleets. We got the blue one.
4.0,"The front is longer, don‚Äôt know if mine are defective or is the style.<br />Is true to size, color is the same as the one in the picture and is comfortable to wear.<br />The only think I dislike is the front that is longer than the back, usually the back is the longer.<br />These loose tops or dress look good with leggings & boots.<br />As a reference I purchased a size Large in Burgundy and black as well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 158lbs and I still have the post baby body.<br />Hope it helps, please click on helpful button  if it does :)"
4.0,Thought it was longer
4.0,This jacket was actually very nice.  It looked more expensive than it cost.  I would buy this again.
4.0,I ordered a size up to be sure it would fit but the arms still feel tight to me.
4.0,I wore it for a month and then it broke! The whole top part with the stone broke off. Not repairable. So bummed.
4.0,"Very cute, wish it had a bit more elastic to stay on the head."
4.0,You need to get a size up from what you usually wear
4.0,Nice my daughter loves it.
4.0,funny..it is what it is...
4.0,"I'm indifferent on these. Not the best hiking socks I've tried, but also not the worst. They have a lot of hype but just fail to really impress or stand out as a top performer. Long story short, these wouldn't be my first choice but they are better than just a standard sock if you're going to be hiking all day."
4.0,"This is one of the most important gifts for men, and it made the happiness of my friend who continues to thank me.<br />Classic, very flexible design and very refined.<br />Made with strong, resistant material.<br />I even ordered another one for myself and was really satisfied.[[ASIN:B01BH6RWXS DASH Co. RFID Extra Capacity Bifold Passcase Men's Wallet]]"
4.0,[[ASIN:B00X4WHP5E Amazon Echo]]
4.0,"I was pleased to find that there was an assortment of the three colors I wanted the most! The price was fair for all three, and they‚Äôre of pretty decent quality. Would recommend!"
4.0,"Stretchy, soft material and super cute vibrant design and colors but feels like a night gown"
4.0,"I had medically needed liposuction surgery to remove Lipedema from my legs and needed full compression as opossed to just stockings, I ordered these and wore them just 2 days after surgery. Like all proper compression, it was a struggle to get them on right, expecially after having surgery! I used a trick with plastic bags... you put your feet into plastic grocery bags then slide your feet into the compression leggings... then you just ""walk"" them up your thighs little by little and once they are up just pull the plastic bags out. Only issue was that the seam right at the waist did not stretch and since I had just had surgery, I could not stand the pain the pressure caused on the bruising, so I cut the seam off. The leggings are still usable like that, no running or anything which means they are of good quality material. Plus side is they have a panty on the inside which is of nice stretchy material too. Overall I am happy with them and will be ordering more so I have plenty available since due to my condition I will need to wear compression probably for the rest of my life.  For size reference, I am 5'6, size 16 and about 218 lbs and I ordered an XL."
4.0,Its pretty. I thought it was silver from the picture but its not.. my fault I didn't read. Its Gold. :(<br />Super heavy and hurts my ear. The clasp was bent all out of shape when I got it.<br />Was ok for the 3 bucks I paid.
4.0,"I bought one for my future daughter-in-law and she was so happy with I bought one for myself, but in a different color.<br />vibrant colors and well designed fit make me feel a little bit special when I wear it."
4.0,I wish they had bigger sizes.
4.0,It's a well made and inexpensive sweatshirt. It fit in line with what we expected from standard sizing.
4.0,Nice sunglasses. They are big. You can see your eyes through them. They are cute. I don't wear sunglasses all the time so they should last a long time. And for the price and it came with two and cases they are fine.
4.0,I really like this skirt however; it runs about two sizes too small.
4.0,This skirt was really pretty and spark! The sequins did fall off easily though.
4.0,"El juego completo, le gusto al cliente, lo original que se ve"
4.0,The most I ever paid for socks. My feet do feel great in my boots now. They are very long but don't leave much if any mark on my legs.
4.0,I loved this dress so much I‚Äôm buying a purple one now too. It is such a flattering dress and so comfortable. I wanted a long sleeve dress for a holiday party and I felt so comfy and confident in this. LOVE
4.0,These are amazing. Great length. Comfortable. Love the wash and frayed areas. I wasnt sure they'd fit my Oompa Loompa shaped body but they fit perfect. I mean yeah I still have muffin top but thats to be expected with having 6 kids.  I can always spanx my tummy but I greatly enjoy the fact that my backside isn't playing peek-a-boo with the whole world. I will say the denim is thin and has more stretch than I was expecting so I may end up ordering another size but smaller to see what feels better.
4.0,The scepter is nice.  The Velcro on the criss we n came off the first day but I was able to mend it.
4.0,"I loved the detailing on the Womens Waffle Knit Tunic T Shirt size large. The deep v neck and big buttons gave what might otherwise be a plain T-shirt some extra interest and oomph.<br />The shoulders and sleeves were perfectly sized and I have wide shoulders and am 5'10 so this is often a problem area in shirts for me.<br />The one problem I had with this shirt was the bust line it was almost too small. This is not a problem I have often have but these seem to be somewhat small through the bust.<br />Otherwise, this was an attractive and well-made Tshirt suitable for late summer and fall wear for me."
4.0,I bought the rose gold version and  the one I got looks like the regular gold. But they look  nice.
4.0,Quality is good but it's not the same size. It's too short
4.0,Not too bad I would have considered a size larger but it works for casual comfort.
4.0,beautiful purse -- too small for my needs
4.0,Very cute print Granddaughter will love it. Anything ‚ÄúMarie‚Äù is a win
4.0,"They shrunk a lot,Jake sure you order a bigger size"
4.0,"I love the design of the shirt, but I have big arms and wear a size 40DD and the 2XL was still too small."
4.0,"Very sexy dress on, straps are very thin so be careful adjusting them also the back of the dress is see-through, so wear nude undies. other then that I loved It!"
4.0,Love it but color was to pale.
4.0,"I ordered this ring as I thought it was a nice addition to my every day wear collection. It arrived in a timely manner and undamaged. It comes in only the whole sizes. I typically wear a size 7.5 and due to this being a wider than normal ring for a women, I ordered an 8. It is slightly too big but does not fall off my finger due to the wider band. I mark it down from a 5 star rating because of the irregularity of the cubic zirconia gem set. They are not set in a precise line and two of the gems are tipped to the side. I expected some imperfections and I can turn the two tilted gems to the bottom so overall I still give this a pretty positive rating. I have several CZ rings and I think if you are looking for perfection in the set, you will need to pay much higher jeweler prices. For the price, this is a great ring! If anyone is looking that closely at your ring to notice these imperfections, their opinion probably shouldn't matter that much to you. I also notice the inevitable scratches that come with wearing a ring a little more because of the wide metal band. The ring cleans up well, just like my wedding band. It has been cleaned in my jewelry sonic cleaner and looks wonderful again. I didn't pay full price for this product, but I think it is on par (even at full price) with the other CZ jewelry I've purchased from Amazon vendors in the past. I will continue to look for similar products as I enjoy the variety of this jewelry without having to worry like I do over my wedding band."
4.0,"These were longer than I expected, other than that I have no complaints."
4.0,"The bracelet is well made, however the variscite beads are much smaller then portrayed in the picture, and it's coloring somewhat darker!!!!"
4.0,"May look small, but it carries enough toiletries."
4.0,"I love the design and the fabric. However, it is on the smaller side, I would suggest ordering the next size up unless you like things a little snug. I would buy other shirts from this seller:)"
4.0,"The slippers are great except the Sheepskin on the inside of the sole (where you slide your feet in- at the heel) wore off the first week.  They will still last a long time due to the rubber sole on the bottom.  The leather uppers and sheepskin trim look great when I'm wearing them, but I am disappointed and surprised at how quickly the inside wore off.  Otherwise, they look brand new."
4.0,Really liked this product!
4.0,A little more fitted through the arms than I would prefer but not bad.  The style is very trendy and comfortable. Fun to wear.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d9d75a0c8ac1abaab979340126caaa8b]] I got the neutral color of polish to polish my white nursing shoes.  I didn't clean them first since I don't have a cleaner, but the wax took some of the scuffs off.  As I was applying the wax, I felt that the shoe was getting somewhat off-white, but when I put the polished and unpolished shoes side-by-side, it looked like the polished shoe was a bit whiter, so I guess that was my imagination.<br /><br />The shoe did NOT get any shinier though.  I didn't buff it, but other waxes that I have used in the past do make the shoe shinier without buffing, but this was not the reason I got this wax.  I was more interested in the water resistant aspect since these are nursing shoes.  You can see in the video that the water beads on the polished shoe, but not on the unpolished one, so I am happy with that.<br /><br />The included applicator pad is a plus, so you don't have to find something to apply it with and then either throw it out or keep it for next time.<br /><br />My only complaint is that technically, ""neutral"" is a color; it is not clear.  The basic colors of shoes are black, white and brown, so why did they make black, brown and neutral instead of white, or at least clear.  I didn't ding for that though.  The one star ding was for not creating a shine like most shoe waxes do.  I don't personally care in this case, but most people do."
4.0,"Ordered this to use as a bathing suit cover up. I am 5‚Äô7 and when I tried it on it barely covered my butt. That being said, it would make a really cute summer shirt with the right accessories. The fabric is slightly sheer but with a nude bra or something you probably could get away with wearing it without a tank top underneath. The tassels are really cute and it appears to be really well made. It just didn‚Äôt work for me for its intended purpose."
4.0,Comoda y simple<br />Color algo diferente al de la fotograf√≠a
4.0,"Very stylish, comfortable and a great price."
4.0,"Nice ring. Spinning center was a nice surprise. Slight flaw in center section. Overall, a good product."
4.0,"I like the fact that this protector has no smell and can be used indoors. Simply spray it on the shoes, let it dry, and it is all ready. It seems to work, too."
4.0,"Cute, I Luv the leopard print.  They are much lighter weight than expected"
4.0,Cute shoes but right foot was so small!  I guess Life Stride runs small and narrow. I had to return these.
4.0,Easy to use and spacious
4.0,"Nice, vibrant colors with great stretch."
4.0,"Wore this dress for my son‚Äôs Christening and received so many compliments. It was light, comfortable and moved easily."
4.0,"Live the length of the top in front , but the back was too long to wear with golf skirts.  Pants are ok, but I am having the altered"
4.0,Can pinch arm hair or pull at certain fabric
4.0,"I was expecting both sides to be covered, since it is ""full"" graphic, but the back is blank white. This does mean there are no printing issues on the seams, which happen with fully printed shirts. Printing isn't super bright but looks great and has no issues like missing parts, etc. This would be 5 stars if they stated that the back was blank.<br />The shirt fits just like a US standard size. If you wear M shirts normally, this will fit. I will upload pictures."
4.0,My son uses these to keep his head covered at work as well as protect his hair at the same time. The pre twisted tail is a nice touch and makes it easier to wrap and make adjustments. The inner satin is soft as it should be to protect strands
4.0,"It's warm, soft & cozy.  My only concern is that it sheds terribly, even after washing it."
4.0,"The merchandise was as good as it gets, however I has to go to a dealer to get it cut  as cutters would  not cut a key they did not sell"
4.0,Watch is easy to use. Only wish I could answer calls on the watch. And the battert life last til about evening hrs but if used alot it drains fast
4.0,"It‚Äôs fine for what it is, I was needing something to hold my glasses to my face during hard and/or sweaty activities and it was too long/not adjustable enough for that.<br /><br />Not a design flaw, just not what I needed."
4.0,"Very comfortable, fits nice. The seam where the two fabrics meet is a little strange, but not terrible. I wear it a lot"
4.0,"Natural and comfortable fashion but unfortunately runs small. Arrived sooner than expected.  If you order the right size, it's a good deal."
4.0,Love this product it‚Äôs very comfortable and easy to wear with your everyday outfits
4.0,This is a very cute dress. The fit is perfect and the quality is really good too.
4.0,Truly linen. Wrinkles easily but that's typical for linen.
4.0,The sole was a little stiff and hard. Unusual arch support feeling. Back strap is for a large foot. Almost too big for a 9.0. What made this sandal a delight was the material used for the foot to sole interface. Amazing. No slip even when wet. Very comfortable. Made up for the stiff sole. Very light and airy. I like it.
4.0,I tried the large first because I'm size 10 to 12 but I had to size up to get the loose look I choose for work.<br />The design is classy. The fabric is heavier than the seller's palazzo pants. These will pair great with a long blazer.
4.0,I definitely should have ordered a size bigger than what I normally wear as it fit really snug.
4.0,These are very nice good quality just a little small but they'll do for what I need them for...
4.0,This robe is soft and silky. The sizing is right on. It's comfortable and covers well. The only issue I have with it is that it will not remain closed. I have to adjust it often to stay covered up.
4.0,"After what felt like forever, it wasn't eligible for prime shipping, I received this top, it's constructed well and is very beautiful. The pictures online didn't really show all the details in the fabric. It does run a bit in the small side but it laces up the back so it's not a huge deal. It's very comfortable and a flattering fit. Overall very pleased with this item.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I have only worn it once so I guess I will have to wait to see if it is 5 star. So far I really like it. Nice HD belt and looks great with my dress pants.<br />If all goes as planed I want to loss about 30 lbs & when I do I will see how cutting off excess belt goes.
4.0,I have on a large and it fits great. Normal size dress is 14. Great stretch and sexy but comfortable fit.
4.0,This helped to complete my Macho Man costume perfectly!  The bandana was a tad bit small but still did the trick!
4.0,"I love this dress! The fabric is a bit thick and stiff, like super stretchy polyester. I was unhappy with that at first, but the dress is so comfortable and looks so great that the fabric is forgivable."
4.0,"Just got it, so I'll tack on the extra star after g months or so, but this thing is QUIET, plus the 4 pre-programmed settings are a nice touch. I was surprised at how big it was, but it's not too bad."
4.0,"Basic slipper that I can wear around the house. Fits nicely over a pair (or two) of socks, a bit loose for bare feet. Nice sole for those times when I have to dash outside for a minute or two."
4.0,"Definitely orange - not red. I love a bright bag, but this one was just a little too small for my build and too orange to work with my wardrobe. It seemed to be good quality, just not the right size or color. The picture is pretty close to the actual color (if your brightness is all the way up), but I wouldn't say the sellers description as &#34;tomato red&#34; is the best choice. &#34;Orange-red&#34; or &#34;tangelo&#34; or &#34;fire orange&#34; might be better descriptions."
4.0,They are great. Have a nice sole. The only problem is the part where the strap starts does not fit right between your big toe and the rest of your toes. The strap starts in the middle which makes no sense. It seems like it could possibly be adjusted though
4.0,"After my first band broke shortly after receiving it, the company contacted me and offered me a replacement no questions asked. The replacement band looks and works great! It's been over a month now and it's holding up perfectly."
4.0,"They came quicker than expected and seem to be high quality. My issue is that they come unmarked, so it's impossible to tell what gauge you're using if you don't have some sort of background knowledge with gauges. I'm only on the first pair, the 16g, so I can't speak for the rest, but I've found that they're unreasonably long compared to other tapers. It makes for a more gradual slope, however, they tend to stab my neck and get caught pointing straight down instead of behind my head. My boyfriend is at a 00 right now and even he said that the tapers are extremely long in comparison to the ones he used when he was gauging up. Other than that, however, they are nice and exactly what I needed. I cleaned them and used a bit of lube, and they slid right in without a problem."
4.0,I love the look of this dress. The fabric is soft and it fits well.
4.0,"It's small, just the size I wanted for my laptop. It's cool, I really  like the drip effect. Only thing, the drips don't like to stay - I have to press them back down every now and then. But none of them have ripped off yet, so that's good."
4.0,"I was impressed with the quality of the piece for being only $9.  It's super soft and stretchy and the straps are adjustable to fit most sizes.  Unfortunately, I am in between an A/B cup, and even though the straps adjust, you can tell there's too much fabric for my size/or lack-thereof.  For reference, I am 5'3 and about 140#.  I ordered a Large.  Maybe in a Medium the bust wouldn't be so obviously over-sized?  Regardless, a good piece for the price!"
4.0,"The quality seems nice, strong fabric. But is really small. i've ordered une size up, and is still small."
4.0,The necklace is beautiful but cheap looking. The chain discolored easily but the sun pendant still looks pretty good. The length of the necklace is perfect.
4.0,decent product for the money
4.0,I would have liked a 1/2 size availability. So I bought the larger size which has turned out okay.<br />The colors and tje motif on the left and right side are a nice touch.
4.0,"Advertised as knee high, but a couple inches short."
4.0,Really like these panties. No show and very comfortable for every day use. They are on the large size
4.0,This cover is pretty and made of good quality material.  I was disappointed to see that the enclosure is a zipper.  That is going to make it tricker to quickly close since the enclosure is on the bottom of the luggage.  I double checked and the description says it is velcro so I am not sure why the change.  I am going to have to think about whether this will be functional or consider returning.
4.0,Overall great looking bra ! The sides by my arm are a little wide for me I wish this came in am xsmall.
4.0,I won't give it a five stars because this skirt is really not the length it shows here. I like it but I wish it covered my shoes.
4.0,"Looks good. Ok quality. Feels cheap, but gets the job done."
4.0,"These are nice, light weight and comfortable."
4.0,"These seem great, but they are a little big for my toddler. I really liked them though so I am going to keep until he grows into them. Four stars because they were too big"
4.0,"Love these! got them for my bridesmaids, but had to get an size larger for everyone, since they run a bit small."
4.0,Nice glasses and clean loook. Fits the head nice
4.0,"My wife loves this bag,me? I hated it soon as I seen it,not good quality to me,but my wife loves it so I kept it....üôÑüëé"
4.0,"liked it, very long though. great for bbw and busty"
4.0,"Terrific watch for the price. Fit is just right, simple to wind an set time. Great weight and look. Lots of admirers."
4.0,"Very cute bag, exactly what we wanted.  Don't even mind the big patch that others said they removed.  Has lots of pockets, makes a great purse or daypack."
4.0,Serves the purpose when we travel.
4.0,A little thinner than most Jordan shorts
4.0,"The pins are smaller than what the picture indicates.  However, in the description they say the pins are about 1.5"" which is right.  I thought they were nice and worth the price."
4.0,I wear medium shirts but needed to get the large/extra large size.  This size fits really well.  It's comfortable and wears well. I washed it and let it hang dry (no dryer) per instructions...it held it's size well.
4.0,"Fit as expected I wear a large and ordered a large, was a little thin and need a jacket or undershirt"
4.0,"so far so good! These stakes haven't warped yet (unlike some of the Y stakes I own), and keep my tipi staked down in heavy wind."
4.0,"Very lightweight and not bulky.  I don't even know it's there 1/2 the time.  I did have to soak it to fit all the cards I carry, and am still leaving a stack behind!  That's not the wallets fault though.  I'm fitting 11 cards in there plus a few bills. Quality seems very good so far."
4.0,"Arrived fairly quickly. Good size and quality for the price!! I wanted something a little less sporty for my watch for when I'm not working or at the gym. Not too expensive and fits well! I have a pretty big wrist, I wore the L apple wristband and fits about the same. Looks nice, might buy in more colors depending on how it holds up."
4.0,"Nice, good quality for the price. Doesn't feel like the sparkles will come off easily."
4.0,I l√≠ke the shoes good service
4.0,Color bleeds during washing!
4.0,"Cool colour, nice fit"
4.0,"Love these! Had to stretch the waste out a little for them to fit comfortably. Also definitely a fall weather kind of clothing for they are a little heavy. But all around, they are great!"
4.0,"At first glance these are cute pants and they fit right, but they are very thin. To the point where I‚Äôm afraid to wear them without spandex shorts underneath because I‚Äôd be afraid that if I were standing in the right light, you‚Äôd be able to see through them! It‚Äôs not going to stop me from wearing them because they are comfortable and look nice, just beware."
4.0,"Open it up.<br />Put in the glasses.<br />Close it.<br /><br />Behold.  Encased glasses.<br /><br />Open it up.<br />Remove the glasses.<br />Install on face.<br /><br />Behold.  A light-weight case to bear.<br /><br />My one-star penalty is that the clip doesn't hold well.  However, it's good enough for my uses.  It might benefit from applying some pliers to close the metal inside and make the clip a bit more grippy."
4.0,"These are great! Not see through and don't droop at the crotch.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of the seam on the butt, not particularly flattering..."
4.0,"Overall a nice bracelet. The centerpiece  looks durable and I like the size. The strap/chain looks as though it would break if you are rough with it. The strap/chain was also a little big. Had it tight as it would clasp and was still loose on my wrist. No worries though, just knot the leather and it tightened right up and still looks good."
4.0,"Nice costume! Fit snug on a guy with 36&#34; waist. The hat, collar and belt could be better quality, but for the price... pretty nice."
4.0,"These are practical and bohemian. They seem a little thin, but I think it‚Äôs a good value for the price."
4.0,The pieces are all very cute however are not amazing quality. Obviously for the price you do pay for what you get so if you are just wanting this for random things or for just starting to create something and don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money than definitely give this a try! 6/10 would recommend! I have made many earrings and they are super cute!!!
4.0,Pants are really nice however they are pumpkin orange not brown! I wanted like a cinnamon brown pant and unfortunately will not wear orange! Fit great and the style is really nice though!
4.0,Using it to attach to slim-line wallet which holds my bus pass.....I attach it to my purse and slim wallet so I won't have to open my pocket book all the time....I don't use it for jewelry...although I could.
4.0,Very nice and cute. Will get more
4.0,Comfortable but I wish they were all the same length.
4.0,Quality was decent and it was comfy but a medium wouldnt fit a 34A. If only there was a small available.
4.0,"I bought large, don‚Äôt know why it says XL but can‚Äôt complain still fits and are pretty durable, has a good grip too"
4.0,"The heels slip a bit, for the price I had higher expectations"
4.0,"The reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the lower portion of the sleeves. It's scratchy, not long enough and looked awkward on. I took it apart at the seam and it looked so much better as a short sleeve bodysuit."
4.0,The mask doesn't fit like the picture. It's sticks out more.
4.0,"I purchased this for a Doctor Who halloween party<br /><br />It's pretty cool for what it is, though the plastic at times feels pretty cheap and i worry that I might break it. The button on top gives it the cool lights and sounds though my complaint with that is that it's too sensitive and it goes off every 2 seconds and the it only has one quote so it can get annoying after a while. Sounds quality on that recording isn't too great either. The size is a little too big also compared to your average pocket watch but then again this is a toy and still looks pretty cool on display."
4.0,"Very cute and modest. Pads are not the right size and wired looking, they won't stay in place when in the sea :-(. Might work for pool but not sure. They need to be stitched to the suit from the inside or replaced with other ones. It ran a little large for me."
4.0,"These readers in the XL size don't have the expansion joint in back that were/are the weak point on the XXL size Clics. I went through two pairs of the XXLs where the rear joint broke within a couple of months, making them useless, and they're expensive. I also note that this XL size has lenses that are not as tall as the regular sizes or the XXL size. They also come in more limited color choices, and don't include the tortoise shell ones that I prefer and have worn for years. Now I'm stuck with only plain gray."
4.0,"Always remember, with Tipsy Elves brand unless the onesie is skin tight and looks feminine/ ""sexy"" the item is unisex. Ordered this in a medium for my daughter for Halloween and did not disappoint. For reference she's 12, 5'6 and about 110 lbs. A small probably would've worked but She wanted a little room to wear long sleeves and leggins under since we love in the Midwest.  Only reason why i took off a star is because after the first wash,  the tail got a tiny snag in it and lost half its cotton. Its an easy fix with a decent sew job but still. The stitching on the tail is a little flimsy for the almost $80 price tag. We own several tipsy elves costume onesies and this is the only one that didn't make it though a wash ok."
4.0,"Highly recommended.  I have Stetsons that cost over $150.00, I get more compliments with this hat for under $15.00. It was slightly large so I put a piece of felt from Ace hardware inside the liner to make it fit. Small inconvenience."
4.0,Like the dress just wish the Empire waste didn't dip down in the back. Still I will wear it. It fits really good.
4.0,"Cute, basic and comfortable dress.  Perfect for summer work in the length and tank strap width.  It‚Äôs basic, but it‚Äôs a nice clean line so it‚Äôs sharp.  BUT, for me, I have a pretty round athletic behind and it‚Äôs one of those dresses that ends up being ‚Äúbusiness in the front, party in the back‚Äù.  Not too terrible, but that is annoying in a dress (I wish they would cut skirts on these types of dresses keeping in mind that a butt will make the back ride up a bit).  It‚Äôs right at the knee-line in the front and 1-2‚Äù higher in the back.  Still wearing it, but I would give it a 5 if not for that."
4.0,It was a gift and well liked
4.0,Very pretty but the charm was a bit larger than I expected (prob my own fault for not reading enough of the info)
4.0,"Really like the material of this product, but runs small."
4.0,"This watch is exactly what I needed: it told the time. It also, of course, gives the date and it has an alarm. It can switch to 24-hour time and it has a not-so-impressive backlight that only lights half the screen. It's a nice little watch. Nothing fancy, but nice."
4.0,Doesn't seem to be same quality as other hats I have had in the past.
4.0,"Fits slightly larger than I expected, but it works well.  I am able to style my hair and it doesn't mess up the style.  It is easy to put on and take off, though a too-strong breeze can move the hat enough that I worried once or twice it would be pulled off.  I really like the color and fit, though."
4.0,"Nice hat, worth the price, however the material is not very durable."
4.0,"I like these jean shorts overall. They aren't too short but they are a nice length. They are well made with quality material. They have some stretch to them for comfort, though I find them to be a little tight (not sure if that due to pandemic weight gain or that these run small.)  Overall, they are nice simple cut offs. I like them."
4.0,"The pendants are positively stunning. Although these are couples, I got them for my best friend and me and we absolutely love them. The pendants are high quality and durable. This would receive five stars if it weren't for the issues I've experienced with the chains. It came with one cheap silver chain and one black rubber-ish chord, both very cheap. The black chord wouldn't even go into the pendant; the clasps were too big. I always have chains from old necklaces laying around, so it wasn't too much of a problem for me. It's beautiful with its replaced chain and perfect for my friend and I."
4.0,Nice shirt. Would buy again
4.0,"I was looking for a loose fitting shirt to hide my belly, but this looks more like a potato sack. It's ok, but definitely not how I expected it to fit."
4.0,"Hi! I'm usually a small, but after reading reviews I decided to size up a bit because i'm about 5ft inches. SIZE UP if you are tall/ have longer legs. The small was shirt length, but the medium fit well!"
4.0,"I had such high hopes for this dress.  It's pretty and comfortable on (the arms are a bit tight, though), but it's also shapeless and there is no &#34;glimmer&#34; to the color.  The fabric is the same as you'd find in panty hose that are 100% nylon -- there is no give at all -- and the material is pretty fragile.  My husband was not impressed with the dress, and thought my arms looked like they had tattoos on them -- there either needs to be more embellishments on the arms or none at all.  I was thinking that I could put a different, maybe darker dress underneath the sheer dress, but the underdress is actually connected, and would not be easy to remove or replace.  I'm in my 50's (but cute and youngish), but I think this dress would be much better suited for a teenager or someone very &#34;waif like&#34;."
4.0,Love the light weight material. Fits my granddaughter well
4.0,"Nice boot to wear for cold weather. Great for beach or sandy places, no sand in your shoes."
4.0,High quality (Y)
4.0,"You just never know about sizes.  I would say order up 2 sizes on this.  This skirt is adorable and really good quality.  If you wore a size 10 normally in a skirt, get a 14 or XL."
4.0,"Love this purse, get lots of Compliments.  Reason I only gave 4 stars is because the zipper material started to separate from the side of the purse right away, but only a little bit and then it stopped."
4.0,"This organizer is a really good buy. It's easy to assemble and customize, and it's well-made of durable materials. It rotates smoothly and has a deceptively large storage capacity. Great for cosmetics, hair products, etc."
4.0,"Good for the price.  Don't compare to Thinxs, but they are so much cheaper."
4.0,It fits a little snug but I love it
4.0,"Arrived on time and looks as portrayed.  I cannot attest as to durability or quality yet because they are gifts and will not be given until the holiday season.  Hopefully, they will stand up to daily wear and tear of handwashing.."
4.0,They're very comfortable and fit very secure. The only reason they did not get a five is I don't believe they get dark enough but it does say on the description smokey. Not True midnight black. So that's on my fault. They do get dark enough though to take out some of the intensity and glare that is on the road during the day.
4.0,Was a little loose and awkward but looked pretty good
4.0,gloves in perfect condition however they run tight in hand but long in fingers even for typical small size.
4.0,"Cute and Easy to put on; Not sure how long it will last, but it works. Would buy again or as a gift."
4.0,"I'm really happy with this hat.  I tried not to expect much and was pleasantly surprised.  It fit well.  Although it wasn't shaped perfectly, It can be shaped exactly as I want it.  I love this hat.  I'm getting ready to order another one!"
4.0,Love the design. Only negative is skirt is too long for an infant. Going to tske her pics so it will look cute with her sitting-not standing. She'll be 1 yr and shirt has some room. Would be wayy too large for a 6-9 month
4.0,Ordered size for my 4 year old and seemed much too small.  I returned for a 6-7 replacement.  Got an 8 replacement so huge and he will grow into.  Product seems nice.  Only issue with the request for 6-7 and getting 8.  Not in mood to replace because he will grow into.
4.0,Stunningly beautiful dress! Gorgeous and different sleeves. Fits a FS bit loose around the waist but not bad. Length is okay. My feet show which I don‚Äôt care for. I prefer my maxis to sweep the floor but not a deal breaker. Looks like a gauzy material which will probably shrink. Definitely won‚Äôt be happy if that happens!
4.0,"Exact 100 was in the order and it looked just like the picture. There was a few that looked a little off but in a lot of 100 it's not too big of an issue. The string size also varied by a few centimeters, some of which were a little short to my liking but it can be overlooked.<br /><br />^ ^ Overall, this is great."
4.0,Liked. It‚Äôs for a 1 yr. old child.
4.0,Super cute but size down. Too large
4.0,These rings fit great and I wear them while at work or the gym. The rings do have a noticeable seam down the middle and I wish it was perfectly smooth.
4.0,"I absolutely love this necklace. It's very pretty. When I wore it to church last week,I got sooo many compliments. Very nice !"
4.0,"cute design, but too big for 5years old girl ^^"
4.0,Great love the support it gives and comfort it provides. You won't be upset with this purchase. It meets the need so I can carefully recover from surgery.
4.0,I think they will be perfect. The quality and appearance are fine. A great look for the price paid
4.0,Cute when dressed up. It‚Äôs a little boring without heels and jewelry.
4.0,"Great for the beach for sure,  but I was hoping it would be cute with leggings. Its just too big and too long. (I am 5 7"" and 150 lbs.) The fabric is a simple polyester. and the blue is very bright. I would say the online description is very accurate. It's quite expensive for what it is."
4.0,"Most comfortable, best fit!"
4.0,soft n stretchy w/o pilling
4.0,"The shirt sizes seem to be Women's instead of Men's. They run VERY small. Quality is good and they served the purpose needed for our company softball team, but we were scrambling to find larger sizes for some players. I would size up 1 when ordering."
4.0,Very good quality. And it came eariler than expected by a month.Only problem was i didnt think the inside would be split in half but its still a great and lasting.üëåüëåüëçüëç
4.0,"Very nice gloves. Not real leather, but didn't expect it for this price."
4.0,I really like I look and style of these glasses. I would prefer a nose pad but I'm still happy with these. Very light weight.
4.0,"I gave it as a gift. Luckily it for the recipient and he loves it, but it does run a tad small."
4.0,The set is very nice.  However the ring is not adjustable and they do not ask for your ring size at purchase.  It's a shame because my ring is too small
4.0,"Super cute, zipper is a bit tricky though"
4.0,Light and simple jacket with nice color and construction is as expected for price
4.0,"great soft sock, love the design but it slides down my calves"
4.0,Cute dress material feels heavier than we expected as well ran a little big for our toddler.
4.0,Nice sweater- but sleeves are too short.
4.0,"I'm glad i went with what other reviews said on buying bigger....I am 5'6&#34; and 128lbs, usually wear a Medium. I purchased a large, the top fits great and the bottom is a bit snug on my behind! its also very cheeky but thats what i wanted so overall i'm happy with the purchase! Great for the price range."
4.0,"Little bit short but otherwise great fit, soft, beautiful top"
4.0,"This is a beautiful ring! For the price, you can‚Äôt go wrong. The color of rose gold looks authentic and the stone is a gorgeous. It fit true to size. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because one of the small stones is pushed in more on bottom right. Other than this, I am very happy with this ring."
4.0,The quality is exactly what you pay for. But regardless I wore it a lot in the spring so got money's wort.<br />It's a cool looking hoodie with sweats when your in a rush
4.0,Love this. I'm 5'2 110lbs & It fits perfect. It's a little weird In the neck area(fit wise) but otherwise no complaints! Worth the buy!
4.0,The plastic is way cheaper and lighter than I expected but for about $2 a pair you get what you pay for.
4.0,"I like this suit, fits well, except not much support in top.  However, I can wear a bra with it and it doesn't show."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and 245. Ordered a 2x and it‚Äôs a perfect fit. Love the orange color. I gave it 4 stars because  although it‚Äôs a perfect fit (even sleeve length), the material is a little thin. Overall very pleased with my purchase. Great addition to my wardrobe for cooler days."
4.0,Nice style but the mateial is a really thin cotton stretch.
4.0,I used this for a wedding and I recurved many compliments. I really liked how the colors matched and my only complaint is the cuff links. They were very low quality. They were plastic and not a stainless steel cuff links.
4.0,Pretty comfortable for height.Greta for standing but not too much walking. It is a very nice looking shoe.
4.0,"I love how this item has a pocket for a face mask filter. It‚Äôs also very convenient for shopping, etc.  The only issue I have is that the ear holes make this face mask too tight."
4.0,"Well made, machine washable!"
4.0,"It is very pretty, and it came with earrings which I didn't expect..  The down side, It took forever, to be delivered!!  They lost it in transit, so I almost forgot I ordered it.."
4.0,"its bigger than i thought, but i folded it in and its fine"
4.0,"I bought this watch for my son to teach him how to read a clock.  It has a digital time as well.  This watch is easy to read, easy to use and adjust, and looks great on.  I recommend this watch for its value."
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty just wish the  fringe went all the way around the dress and not just in front.
4.0,very soft. just don't love the seam down the outside of the leg
4.0,These socks are comfortable and fit well. They do not feel any warmer than lower rated thermal socks...
4.0,would buy another
4.0,"Love tbe material, but on the smaller side in my opinion."
4.0,I like the watch.  It feels a bit less substantial then I anticipated and the crystal is already scratched up a bit.  Great little watch for the price though
4.0,Nice quality. Warm. Thick material. Definitely need to size up. I ordered the 2xl but they are to small. Very little stretch
4.0,Pretty!  I need to go find these.  Wonder where I put them?
4.0,"This is a cute hat, the red is a bit darker than the pic, but I really like it.  I've received compliments on this hat.  The sizing strap in the back could work better, but otherwise a great purchase."
4.0,Soft fabric and fit true to size. I'm very busty and the xl fit perfectly with a little room to spare.
4.0,"Necka little  loose,  but niece likes it non the less"
4.0,Makes the FITBIT more suited for casual nights out and other non sporting events.  Good quality.  Very satisfied.
4.0,"Very pretty, quick delivery"
4.0,"I was so incredibly sad. This sandal was perfext instyle, fit and comfort. I plotted to get all the colors but the sole was not rubber and I tend to slip easily without a rubber sole. Broke my heart."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. I have a very similar style from a much more expensive, retro themed website and they fit exactly the same. The arms are a little tight, and the bust is a little small, but nothing that I can't work with. Overall, great dress for the price. The mustard yellow is gorgeous!"
4.0,it is a little too snug.<br />I hope fabrics works in summer.
4.0,I wish it were a little longer.  I like the style and fit.
4.0,"I kinda agree with the &#34;eeeh&#34; review of another buyer.  Not the best.  Color is a lighter pink than I expected.  That's okay. Cheap, but cheap, so can't be too upset.  Definitely a little big/roomy.  Probably okay for large framed sunglasses.  Maybe not so much for regular glasses or readers.  They'll do."
4.0,"These mittens are very soft and cute. They are comfortable to wear.  However, I had hoped they would be warmer.  My finger tips are still chilly in them."
4.0,Just what I needed. Thanks!
4.0,Fit well - soft material- colours are beautiful<br />a little hot and see through though ...<br />-
4.0,"So cute! Can't wait to give these to my daughter. Based on the description and other reviews, I thought they were a bit more flexible. Hopefully they're as durable as everyone claims! Time will tell."
4.0,"This glove is well-constructed and comfortable.  Based on previous experience with Thisulsate, I believe this glove will keep your fingers from freezing when temperature is at least as low as 10 F (-12 C).  I didn't give it 5 stars because the manufacturer had the gall to put a very-obvious advertising label on the outside of one glove.  To be fair, they do actually show the tag in their ad photos.  Still, unless you are big on showing labels, you will want to carefully cut this one off, as I did."
4.0,Love this dress. Very soft and warm. Tight fitted though and not quite like the picture. The neck is more like a cowel neck then an off the shoulder.
4.0,Would buy again.  I bought this for a November wedding and it was perfect. My only complaint is the length. I am 5'3 and with heals (pretty high) this dress still touched the floor.
4.0,This was an anniversary gift and my wife really liked it.  She wears earrings all the time and this simple but classy style goes well for her.
4.0,It's nice but it's a little thinner than I expected. It definitely not as durable as a thicker rubber band but besides that I love it.
4.0,"Nice-looking glasses that I now keep in my car.  I have read that there is no such thing as effective &#34;night-driving&#34; glasses, since all colored lenses tend to reduce the amount of light that reaches your eyes, which is not a good thing at night.  However, these glasses really brighten up a heavy overcast day.  It's truly amazing how they make the clouds seem to lift and the sunlight appear to return.  I do think that, when used on cloudy days, they can at least seem to improve your driving vision.  Probably the polarizing helps in that situation as well.  (They do tend to make the windshields of other cars appear like sheets of yellow plastic, which was disconcerting at first, but I quickly got used to it and don't notice this &#34;effect&#34; any longer)"
4.0,"Its large size, but I liked it"
4.0,"Good, tight, compression base layer. However, the legs end about mid-calf. As in the picture, but the picture could be cropped; not really, that is where they actually end. Not a big issue, but you shouldn't be surprised."
4.0,"Its cute, it will make a good cruise bathing suit cover up. I would not say its good to go  out to a restaurant or anything more formal than that."
4.0,These are great for the holidays! I just wish the women‚Äôs style also had a hood.
4.0,This dress was cute and my daughter liked it but it looks a little cheap to me. Perfect for LOL party tho and fairly priced I guess.
4.0,"This is a very unique ring. The colors are beautiful. I would have given it 5 star if it was not too bulky. My fingers are short so it kinda makes it chubbier. I bought this knowing it was bulky or big, but now that I am wearing it, it does look big. Will post a pix so you can judge for yourself before buying it."
4.0,Super cute but very little room in the bust.
4.0,These are large sizes - I ordered an XL and it's very 'roomy'.  Probably an L would have sufficed.<br />Anyway - nice light shirt - perfect for a workout.  I would buy one again and recommend for excercising.
4.0,"I have a very small waist and it fits me even a little snugly. It's not uncomfortable, but I imagine it might be a bit tight for those with wider frames. After a few washes I've noticed a bit of fabric pilling, but nothing that can't be solved with a lint eater."
4.0,"Really nice looking plugs for the price. They aren't quite as smooth in places as some other ones I have, but I still really like them and they are comfortable.<br /><br />One thing to note: they are very heavy. These are probably the heaviest stone plugs I have. If you have very large gauges that might be an issue, but that's the nature of stone plugs and not a flaw with this product."
4.0,I like how the chart shows the pressure points of the foot areas.
4.0,I purchased these as a gift so I can only rate in appearance.  They are very pretty & appear to be well made.
4.0,"Great watch for the price. It looks decent, constructed well. Durable with daily/nightly wear (remove for shower) for the last 2 months. There is an audible ticking that can be heard from further away than other watches I own, but this is also the least expensive watch I own."
4.0,It's a very pretty but exceptionally delicate ring (exactly the thickness of a dime).  The size also ran about a half size small which was just enough so it wouldn't fit comfortably.
4.0,This is a cute charm but for some reason it is very hard to attach to the charm bracelet.  Much more difficult than most of the other charms that I bought.  But other than that I am happy with it.
4.0,"The gloves are very soft, not itchy at all!. One of the thumb holes is small and leaves a mark on my thumb. Otherwise, they are great!"
4.0,"Great price, not all have doubles for earrings so make sure your buying 2 in bulk"
4.0,Just got these puppys and I do have to say that for the price you can't beat them. I wore them for an 8 mile run. They were light on my face and did not jiggle up down like some glasses I have tried. They are pretty dark though so keep that in mind. I'm  going to see if company makes any other tints and get a couple more pair. Can't talk about longevity but why would I at this price?
4.0,"because I love these tops<br />Sadly they are small fitting and even the 3xl did not fit me, so very disappointed I really liked the.so did my mom."
4.0,Beautiful...but the tree spins around. I had to add a dab of glue to keep it sitting in the upright position
4.0,"Like them, a little lighter then I expected, which may be good. Like the red frame, wanted a different one from my other sunglasses."
4.0,"It needed some adjustments to fits with my g-shock Ga-100, but i made it by myself, without a professional. Good for the price"
4.0,"I have to admit that the cut out on the shoulders is a real issue for bras.  I bought this in a plus size and those of us who are plus know going without a bra is taking our lives into our hands.  Other than this, the fit and texture is great.  I love the shirt for the office, home etc.  The color is a wonderful deep red and it has held up after many washings.  I am quite pleased with the garment, and love the length of it."
4.0,"The front looks cool, but the back is just flat. The compass works ok but there is an air bubble in it that prevents it from functioning as it gets stuck under it. Its big too, which I like but thats up to you."
4.0,"Love, love, love! Cannot wait for my baby to wear it. Only 4 stars due to larger sizing."
4.0,I sized up but this was a really cute top!
4.0,"Absolutely love this dress! Just received it. It is a one piece dress not a skirt & top. Ordered the pale pink/black and the teal/navy. The material is thick but clingy. Being that it is 103 degrees here, these pictures were taken without my Spanx. It will look so much better with the Spanx. The dress shows all of my fat rolls; however, this is a must have! I typically wear an 8 and a 6 depending on how the garment is made. I ordered the medium. The tag says size 6. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 145lbs.. 34C. The top was just a little big under the arms but not noticiable. The bottom is tastefully fitted (lose enough that it is not too tight...comfortable). The ONLY thing I do not like is that the zipper color is the color of the top and it stands out. But, I will more than likely order this dress in a few other colors. The more curves, the better this dress will look. I only gave it 4 stars because of the zipper."
4.0,"This sweater is so cute! However, after washing (according to instructions) it seems a bit dingy and has started to pill. I've also found a hole in the under arm after washing."
4.0,Nicely made.  Subtle pattern.  Overall very satisfied
4.0,"I have a small/narrow face and glasses tend to slide down my nose and fall off .. These are opposite.  They're actually slightly too tight but I continue  to wear them because I'd rather them be too tight than falling down every 2 seconds, plus they're really cute and have a mirror lens."
4.0,"Got this after having tried the Costco TSA Approved Lock Cross Luggage Straps, which were just too much bother.  These seem to be much more practical, helping to strap the suitcase together, but without any locking device - which really didn't a whole lot of security.  I've traveled for years with one strap around my suitcase, but a recent overseas trip convinced me two-way straps would be a lot better than my one-way single strap."
4.0,"Went by the sizing chart and unfortunately they are really big on me. I will make it work but being a little tighter would make them work out friendly. Can only use for a walk, no major exercise. I would say look at the size recommended and size down 1 or 2 sizes if you want it snug."
4.0,I use this in our truck to keep drive thru change from flying about when you hit the brakes. Works out well for this and is easy to find in case it goes flying!!
4.0,I love these earrings.  They look exactly like the picture & shining but expensive looking.
4.0,very nice and it felt great to wear something more edgy for me
4.0,It‚Äôs an ok top. 100% rayon but feels like polyester. For me it‚Äôs a little short. üôÅ
4.0,very nice and fit my husband great!!
4.0,love the fit and quality
4.0,I ordered a 7.5-8.5 which is my usual but it was too much of a perfect fit it looked like more of a 6 or 7 to me but they were very comfortable just too short so looked kinda stupid. But I will be ordering another pair
4.0,This was absolutely beautiful. My only con was that its cut a little small in the vagina area giving you some serious camel toe! I'm normally wear a medium and based on the reviews I ordered a extra large and I'm happy I did.
4.0,"They stretch nicely, fitted but true to size.  They dry quickly.<br />They seem to be not as durable as other Wrangle performance I bought before for hunting but for anything else they are nice."
4.0,"First - I ditched the ""Horween Leather"" band and replaced it with a stock Bertucci nylon strap. The watch itself could easily be a standard-issue US Military Field Watch. It checks all the boxes and I love the fact there is no date complication - just a plain Jane, black-faced field watch. The black face and white hands are the ideal combination for a field watch, because it gets the most effectiveness/readability contrast out of the available luminosity and ambient light. I have watches with white0face, black hands - and they look great and read great in the daylight, but not so great in low-light/darkness. I am very impressed with this watch, and I would buy several of these as gifts for a scout troop, new soldiers, groom's men gifts. birthday gifts, or whatever other occasion where your person is an outdoorsy/manly-man type individual. They are really do set the standard for a perfect, relatively low cost field watch."
4.0,They are what they are advertised.
4.0,"Love these! Beautiful color red for Christmas, Valentines and just in general. Sometimes the clasp does not seem to close easily like it needs to be oiled or something.  I have been wearing them for a couple of months or couple times each week with purchasing again."
4.0,I am very cautious when I wear a bathing suit and is is a good pick. The color and style are good. I don‚Äôt know if there is ever a bathing suit that fits perfect but this is one of the better ones
4.0,so good so far
4.0,"Very cute Halloween costume. They do run small so I could say at least size up one size. The head peice is a lot smaller, everything else fit my son but the head peice seemed to be 2 sizes to small."
4.0,"This is more like a bath mat instead of a door way mat. It looks just like the picture.  For the price, it is a very nice item. I bought it for a gag gift. I didn't care about the quality or size."
4.0,They are so cute and my baby loves them but the sole ripped a little on the edge :(
4.0,"I wear a women's 8.5-9 and I ordered these in a large, they fit well. The soles are great, they have a nice amount of cushion for being so thin. I wear this along with my arch supports and they are great for shopping or playing at the park with the kids. The heel does slip down a bit, but it's negligible to the overall comfort and wear, the shoe doesn't slip off, the material just ends up with a little bit of a fold. For the price they were worth it and I will be ordering more because they are comfortable and convenient."
4.0,Looks a little cheaply made but very cute.  12 year old girl who received gift was happy with it.
4.0,"This set is so gorgeous. It's a nice heavy set of white pearls and stud earrings.  The earrings have long posts that some people may find uncomfortable. That, and the fact that the clasp for the necklace is not a standard ring, lobster, or even toggle clasp are the reason for my 4 star rating as opposed to 5 stars.  The set comes in a velvet pouch inside of a box, ready for gifting. In very pleased with this and I think it's definitely worth the current listed price $28.99."
4.0,"Exactly what you'd expect for the price.  They are slightly bigger than the oversized sunglasses I generally buy.  Lightweight but not flimsy.  The lenses are light, too.  So, on a very bright day, you may still find yourself squinting from the sun.  They are polarized but are closer to non-polarized when compared to my other more expensive polarized sunglasses."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:f57d9476179d39c4b9b25fadd86e3290]] It's a very sexy dress and it compliments your figure but it's a little short and there's alot of boob action. If you're not one for that then you shouldn't get this dress. You'll also need a strapless bra of some sort unless you don't care you bra straps showing.
4.0,"I like the cottony ralph lauren pj's, but these pants are tighter than my other four sets. I would have bought up a size as it is tight in the seat area."
4.0,"I really liked this bag, but the leather felt weird to me (like not really leather). My husband thinks I'm nuts but I felt like it looked fake. (returned it)"
4.0,Good quality but I was unable to use the ring it came with because the ball was too tight of a fit. But otherwise great!
4.0,Loved the material and colours
4.0,Really like this dress.  It can be casual or you can dress it up.  Great Summer dress.  I would recommend this dress.
4.0,Stitching doesn't seem to be the best on parts but looks good.
4.0,it was a gift for my husband. he loves it. only issue is that 9 inch not big enough for him and had to bring to jeweler to add a clasp for additional room needed.
4.0,"Earrings are kind of big for little girls, but they are cute."
4.0,I put this on my wishlist and one of my sons bought it for me for Christmas.  The mustard yellow really stands out but I love it! It's soft and really long which I think looks pretty stylish. My husband at first thought it looked like a robe until I dressed it up with some boots and a scarf.  I also tried it with some tighter fitting jeans and it looks great.... I'm going for a different color now.  It's good to have some staple pieces in your wardrobe that you can mix and match.
4.0,"The dress is a bit small in some key areas, and the color definitely fades out a bit  when stretched.  If you have large hips or breasts, go up one size from your usual."
4.0,They fit well except around the ankles. They're a little loose.
4.0,"Cute, material thin, would order larger size.  The strap was torn and I had to return."
4.0,As much as I disliked ordering a 3x (I wear size 10 & 12) it fit well and was comfy. It's perfect under tops with low backs or cut-outs. Washes beautifully. (Hand wash cycle-cold water/ hang dry).
4.0,Wrong instructions came with this watch.
4.0,The item looked as pictured. The durability has not been proven as it is a gift that hasn't been given to the recipient yet.
4.0,"My wife wears these for cycling and they are perfect for her. They were super affordable, which is nice.<br /><br />These are comfortable and grip her head well. They provide great eye protection as well as shade from the glare.<br /><br />I don't personally prefer the wrap-arounds because I'm a pig and I sweat too much and fog them up, but my wife is built more like a typical human and they work just great for her.<br /><br />For this price, these aren't much of a gamble. Give them a try."
4.0,A hair too big also kinda tight around the high viz part around your stomach. (Meaning the high viz doesn‚Äôt stretch) feels nice and breaths well.
4.0,Comfortable and fit well.  I like these.
4.0,"Warm and comfortable. Can be too warm for mild weather, but I would recommend socks for that."
4.0,"The VersionTech waterproof case for iPhone 6/6s arrived just in time for our yearly Canada fishing trip. I immediately opened it to place on my phone before forgetting. At first it was a little difficult to snap closed completely as it comes in two parts, but eventually I got it. I appreciated that all openings or buttons on my phone were covered and protected. My only issue with it was sensitivity. It was difficult to text with as I had to keep pressing the same letters over and over for it to register. The fingerprint ID scanner wouldn't work each time either. This was a bit frustrating, but for the time being I could handle it since it was only a 4 day trip. Overall, this is good to protect your phone from water, but I do not recommend you use it daily.<br />I received this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Fits ok (could be tighter around the belly) and to my surprise it doesn't get too warm wearing it.
4.0,ALL WAS GREAT EXCEPT SLIGHTLY LOOSE IN WIDTH (WITHOUT SOCKS).  LIKE COLOR.
4.0,Dress fit nice enough. It was slightly big across the stomach so the layered areas looked a little weird but it worked for family pictures and you can‚Äôt see those issues. I ordered a large and wish I got a medium but wonder if it would‚Äôve been tight elsewhere. I usually wear a large or extra large which is a size 14 for me. Pretty happy with the purchase. Very pretty pink.
4.0,"This dress was just as it appears...I am very tall (6ft) and the waist was too short, so it did not hang right.  Wonderful dress for someone shorter."
4.0,IT WAS SO CLINGY...I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE COTTEN LIKE A THICK T-SHIRT BUT WAS REALLY SILKY. DON'T GET ME WRONG IT WAS NICE ON THE SKIN AND FIT EXACTLY RIGHT BUT IF YOU GOT A ROLL ANYWHERE ... LOL
4.0,Digits are not clear in some angles .we can see the background digits in shape of 8 other than that its ok. Waterproof works.
4.0,"these hats do what their supposed to do and that is keep the sun off you. You'll need to put a different chin strap on it but other than that, they are good hats. Great when you need to keep the sun off your skin."
4.0,"Nice fabric and fit.  I Went a size up bc I am breastfeeding and love that it has working buttons. However, I‚Äôm still so busty that I cannot button all the way. Fit is flattering and I can definitely wear after I‚Äôm done with nursing"
4.0,"Overall this top is very cute! It is pretty long (hit mid-thigh) and looked adorable with navy leggings. It fit nicely in the shoulders and wasn't too loose or too tight. The only issue that I had with it is that it is rather wrinkly, and I had a bit of trouble getting it ironed out."
4.0,Bought is as gift to go along with concert tix for my son. The medium was a little larger than expected so I washed it in warm water and dryed to shrink a little and it was perfect!
4.0,"I love the style of this helmet. It's definitely a warm weather helmit for sure. I also read a few reviews that mentioned an annoying whistle sound.. I have yet to hear that when the visor is closed. If I leave it up, I can here a slight whistle around 40 mph. The helmet does not have much sound dampening capability. I don't really mind it because I can actually hear what's going on around me. Situational awareness is nice on a bike. I noticed that I can eat snacks and drink beverages without needing to take the helmet off. My peripheral vision is also increased with this helmet. All in all, I think it's a pretty solid helmet. My only complaint is that I thought it was going to come with a tinted lense and it came with a clearüòî (not shown in the picture). Anyways, I guess I'll have to spend another 40 bucks on the dark smoke lense..<br />Well, hope this helps!<br /><br />Be good to each other.. and party on dudes!"
4.0,"Fit, but didn't like the draw string.  Del Rossa has a different style I love.  A0762"
4.0,"The sizing runs a bit small, but good overall."
4.0,"Good coverage, my glasses didn't fog up. I usually beaer n95s and these were even more comfortable... but also bigger. I wish they have a medium and small size.  I was able to get this for around $25 but the price has jumped up to mid-thirties so I'm not sure if I'll repurchase. I have some Japanese masks that are cheaper and as effective."
4.0,"The only issue with this case that I have is that the lock button for some reason sticks and wants to turn the device off. Other than that I love the color, protection, and overall look/feel of the case!"
4.0,"These are a little bit tight! They are cute though and they really do have a cooling effect. So far they haven't stretched, but I think they will with enough exercise and such. I've been wanting sunscreen arm warmers/coolers for a while, so this is really exciting for me. The little finger hole is a plus. In all, it's great for a costume as well. The only thing I'm not into is the logo on the side. I think the logo takes away from how cool these are."
4.0,Per comments we ordered a size larger than normal.  It did shrink in the wash however not a whole size.  Still enjoyable to wear and more cool and comfortable than silk or synthetics.
4.0,very comfortable. the grey bra seems bigger than the other two but it shouldn't be an issue
4.0,This cami is so soft and comfy. My clothes slide over it with ease. The ruffle at the neckline peeks out softly under a v neck top or sweater. I do wish it were a bit longer . I am 5'3&#34; and i feel it is too short (mid hip). I will still probably buy another one as it is so soft.
4.0,"Good cap, appreciate the sale"
4.0,Looks great although these earrings are inexpensive
4.0,The outfit and quality is good. It is adorable. It runs about a size large (in my opinion). I am OK with it being baggy and maybe it will still be in use next year.
4.0,Very pretty. Good value.
4.0,"This sweater is very thin! Do not expect it to keep you warm in real cold weather. However, it worked nicely here in Florida when the temp dropped into the 50s."
4.0,"This dress is light, airy & beautiful on my 13 year old daughter. She needed a navy dress, but as you can see in the photo it‚Äôs more periwinkle than navy, even though the package says navy. For reference she‚Äôs a size 14/16 in girls but this dress in an XS fit great."
4.0,"Fit as expected, except for the back part that you could see a bulge, it did not look good.  My daughter sent it back."
4.0,"nice dress, however somewhat thick"
4.0,"This is a great jacket. It really is. However, the bottom of the jacket is not elastic so there is no giving. My 9 year old (size of an 11 yr old) son could wear it this year but it's tight at the bottom. I'm not so sure it would fit next year. I plan to return it for that reason. Make the bottom elastic and you'll have the perfect coat!"
4.0,Love these! Fit perfect. But the reason I only give it 4 Stars is because the end of the arms that go behind your ears is kind of sharp so you have to be careful putting them on. Maybe could‚Äôve had a rubber guard on them. But other than that I love them. And love that it came with a hard case for my purse.
4.0,"These gloves should come a tad bigger,I know over all thses are cheap but one size doesn't fit all!"
4.0,Could be better if it has more elastics to hold pencils.
4.0,"It‚Äôs soft and warm, my child.will really enjoy it"
4.0,My 7 year old is very petite.  The underwear for perfect but the training bra is quite a bit big.  I ordered her a size small (4-6 yrs).  I don't blame the company; these are cute and comfortable and she loves them.  Just something to be aware of when shopping for a small framed girl.
4.0,"These are incredibly comfortable, my biggest issue is that they seem to lose their shape by the end of the day. It‚Äôs as if I need to tighten the straps, but if I do that, the back will come up too high. Overall I do find them comfortable to wear thanks to being made with cotton, especially since moving across the country to a much warmer climate than I am used to."
4.0,nicer than what I can find in stores...will probably order another pair to leave in car. they make it easy to keep my no line bifocal glasses on without buying costly script glasses that I would have to switch back and forth to. have done that in the past and tired of having so many script glasses.I can't wear contacts so this is a reasonable solution...not perfect but it works.
4.0,"Beautiful casual dress, I personally dressed mine up with tights, sweater and heels for the office but it can be worn casual as well. The material is ok and its very comfortable. The dress is very see through, I had to wear a slip under it!"
4.0,"Seem to be good quality, fit well and are really cute/fun. Love so far!"
4.0,Looks great without the belt.  I liked the dress but didn't love it.  Nothing wrong just didn't care for the color on me.  Make sure you pick a color that flatters your skin tone.  I thought it would be more of a maroon color and it was more pink.  Pink is not one of my favorite colors.
4.0,"The quality of the shirt itself is great! Really soft. Length of sleeves is perfect! Length of shirt is great but I wasn't sure what size to order so I went by the reviews & I definitely could've used a size or two smaller. I'm an American XL & I ordered a 5XL like it said. It's a loose fit & it looks a little sloppy which wasn't what I was going for but overall, it's a great buy!"
4.0,the earrings were a little hard to put in but once they were they looking great. I had to use my top hole so it would sit better. Surprisingly they are very comfortable
4.0,"Gift for 12 year old granddaughter.  Just a bit small and difficult to tell it is a cat, but wonderful as it is adjustable because I have no idea what ring size she wears.  Her mom said she likes it.  I'm also happy that it is silver so it won't tarnish and it is a reasonable price in case she loses it :=)"
4.0,"Beautiful color, good quality, just a bit large in the calf."
4.0,"Decent little beater watch. Made of plastic obviously but it's a 15 dollar watch so that's what you're gonna get. The ""light"" isn't a backlight, it's a really weak bulb under the light button that aims across the face. Cannot be seen at night unless you're a Kajiit but if you're a Kajiit you probably bartered for a better watch anyway. All in all I give it a solid 6 out of 10."
4.0,"I am in love with this skirt! I'm 5'7&#34; with a 34&#34; waist. I ordered the XL peach skirt and it fits beautifully. It ends right to my knee (which is surprisingly difficult to find), the color is almost an exact match to the photo, if not slightly more vibrant, and it flatters the waist and hips like a charm. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it wrinkles pretty badly. I'll steam it, let it lay out flat, and between the time I get in the car and the time I arrive to college (10-15 minutes), it's already got a few lines in it. Other than that, this is completely fantastic and 100% recommend it!"
4.0,i really like the colors in this blouse. They are more vibrant than what the picture shows. This blouse runs small though. You'll want to order at least 1 to 2 sizes up. I am happy with the shirt
4.0,Good Socks for long day wear
4.0,They fit well and they are comfortable. Color fast in the wash.
4.0,I haven't really worn it yet but it seemed a little tight in the wrong places when tried on.
4.0,We bought the trading pins in advance of a trip to Disney World. I'm sure that they kids will love trading them.  The pins were varied and seem well made.  The only concern - I'm pretty sure that we got 29 instead of 30.  Oh well - still a great deal.
4.0,"You get two loupes. For the price, it is great. Though it is a bit hard to use for me, since they are so small, I don't really regret buying them. I have used them mostly for aligment of nib tines in fountain pens, and for that, they are good enough. The actual magnification is closer to 10x as some have already stated. Regardless, I honestly did not expect anything close to 30x for the price, so no surprises there.<br />A thing to note about these, they are exceptionally well built for the price range. I'll keep it in my keychain for sure."
4.0,It's cute get a lot of compliments cheap
4.0,"-Nicely constructed, comfortable and nice looking.<br />-Lightweight, quick drying material.<br />-Two deep front pockets.<br />-The ""Media pocket"" on the right hand side is just big enough to hold an iphone 7.<br />-One caveat - the fabric is the kind that makes that ""shoosssing sound"" as you walk!<br />-Size XXL = Woman size 14"
4.0,"One of the few plus size harnesses I found.  The rings are adjustable and secure, I've used them all and it's great!  The strap that goes around the hips/waist is very secure.  However, the ones that go around the thigh are very awkward and make me feel like the whole thing is going to fall off if I move wrong.  So at this point I just don't use the thigh straps and just secure the buckles around my waist and it works perfectly!"
4.0,Very cute but I ordered a small for my daughter and it would fit me with no problem. I had to return.
4.0,Muy bien ajustan seg√∫n el size
4.0,"Seemed a bit big for an XL, but not so big that it was a problem."
4.0,"As a Sanrio Loungefly collector this is a must it‚Äôs a OG Loungefly with the vintage Loungefly emblem it‚Äôs a cute little bag only downside was how it was packaged, in a plastic bag instead of a box.<br />It did arrive slightly flattened , just needed to<br />Stuff the inside of the bag to hold<br />It‚Äôs shape other than that I love it !"
4.0,I'm wearing these under my suits during the winter and fall.  Price was pretty good. I had a brown one and decided to buy in more colors.
4.0,Fit great! I have wider hips and it flowed great! The shoulders were a little tight but it is stretchy material.
4.0,Loved this dress but ended up returning it because it was too long and I didn't have time to have it altered before the event I was going to. Beautiful dress though.
4.0,I liked that these were made out of metal. The gemstones were very nice and shiny. I decided not to keep these only because they didn't match my outfit that I was purchasing them for. They were slightly heavy and the quarters were pointy
4.0,"The black inside will mark your finger, which is why it only gets 4 ‚≠ê.  Other than that, it arrived on the deliver day promptly, looks cool and I like the weight and wearing it!!  Would definitely buy something from them again!"
4.0,"the sizing are inconsistent. I ordered the rust and the pink in XL. One fits perfect, but the pink was really tight and short. I am  5'2 and it stopped at my ankle. I am going to return the pink."
4.0,Great quality. Only one suggestion it looks like it has a snap but it doesn't would be nice to have one
4.0,The robe was a beautiful color and I would have kept it but it was too large.  I sear between a medium and large and I ordered the large but way too big.
4.0,"This is s very good buy; stylish, breathable, comfortable and excellent price.  The shoes could us more cushioning in the soles."
4.0,Comfortable and fit well. Just wish the giant logo was not on the front of the shorts.
4.0,These are cute and durable.  I used it for  upper ear cartilage and it is great.  I can sleep in it in and not even notice it.  Great purchase for the price!
4.0,"My measurements are: 32-34‚Äù around my true waist, and 41‚Äù around the widest parts of my hips. Ordered a size 10 (normally I fit into size 6-8). It fits really great around my thighs and butt, bit I like my clothes fitted. I wouldn‚Äôt say it leaves a lot of room for a base layer, which I might want since its only a fleece-lined soft shelled pant. Only 4 stars because it‚Äôs pretty loose around my waist. I‚Äôm finding that not many boarding pants are cut for curvy girls. I will probably keep because the cut is still super cute with a nice flare at the bottom, and the pants aren‚Äôt bulky. However I‚Äôll need to wear with a belt or suspenders for boarding."
4.0,Love it ordered a 2 sizes up fits  perfect
4.0,Wish it was a little more flattering but fits a little big. Will try to get it again in a smaller size. Good material tho
4.0,"Pleather, but comfy."
4.0,"Nice!<br />I'm a medium in US, ordered a large- fits nicely."
4.0,I bought it to cinch the back of tops and dresses. Wish the chain was a little shorter.
4.0,"I have very sensitive ears that cannot tolerate any nickel or junk metal products.  These work for me. As other reviewers have stated, they are very small so if you have thick earlobes they may not be large enough for you. Otherwise they are perfect to sleep in.  They were a little hard to get into my ears because of the angle that you have to hold them for insertion. But I think that has mostly to do with my cantankerous ears and not this product."
4.0,Got this for my Mother In-Law and she loved it!
4.0,"These fit perfectly, and are extremely comfortable. They look great, the only problem is they are the slightest bit see-through even with nude color underwear. I‚Äôm keeping them but I‚Äôm only wearing them with shirts that are long enough to cover the butt."
4.0,These PJ are really soft.
4.0,"Somewhat small, but work able."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 125 lbs 34DD I purchased this in black size medium. It hits my hips and has a lot of stretch to it a bit larger than I expected. Otherwise it‚Äôs good material and made well. Not see through.  I probably could have ordered a small and it would have fit better. It‚Äôs really cute and isn‚Äôt itchy material.
4.0,fits somewhat small on the arms but it is very pretty
4.0,"Pretty much just as expected. You can‚Äôt really see the ‚Äúcrystals‚Äù on the crystal horseshoe one when on. The twist ring didn‚Äôt quite work for me as the keeper was too long to hide in my nose and too wide to go through the actual piercing. The fancy one is significantly heavier then the others and after a full day of wearing my nose was pretty agitated, as to be expected. Overall happy though"
4.0,The choker is OK. It is smaller than the seller leads you to believe.  Will give it to my granddaughter.  Too small for me.
4.0,I accidentally got my charge 2 in the large size versus small.  I bought these as my back up.  They are just like the band you get with the fitbit purchase and you get 3 colors for a decent price.
4.0,The material is so good and is well made.<br />Gave it 4 stars because the sleeves  are small
4.0,"I ordered this for one of my bridesmaids thinking it was primarily purple, as it appears in the picture. However, the necklace is really PINK, which is not one of my wedding colors. I'm going to take the necklace apart and repaint darker. The product is constructed well, but the color is more magenta and pepto-bismol colored than lavender."
4.0,slightly see through but overall a nice shirt.
4.0,This dress is much shorter than I expected/ as shown. It‚Äôs more like a long shirt. Fits just below my bottom.
4.0,The dress itself fits pretty nicely. My only issue and reason for returning is the shoulder part. I have broader shoulder and it just doesn‚Äôt fit well.
4.0,This is a cute and flattering dress. A little see through but nothing the right undergarment can‚Äôt fix. It was longer than I expected it to be.
4.0,Fit fine except the pants were too long
4.0,Nice image and quality shirt but the fit seems a bit wide and short
4.0,I like the color and fabric.  I used it for traveling.
4.0,I really love it but their are two bad things about it.<br />Reasons:<br />1) It falls off really easily<br /><br />2) You can't make it fold and fit around my ear
4.0,True fit and true color as shown
4.0,"Nice Item. I haven't worn this one out yet, but it is nice to have and has the handy little pouch for ease of storage. Will be great to take when traveling or keep in the car for emergencies."
4.0,Wish the chain wasn't so cheap...but overall it was beautiful!
4.0,The dress fit nice but cut out side is a little shorter because of the strings. I got an extra large and it fit comfortably.
4.0,"Haven't had a chance to wear this yet, but I have no problem tucking into the closet for ball season in Louisiana for Mardi gras.  Well made, NOT see through as some other reviewers have said.  Pay attention to the sizing chart and order based on measurements, not your normal size and you will be fine.  Color true to photos.<br /><br />As a note, I got these at a discount in exchange for leaving a review, but I am a long time Amazon shopper and depend on the community to guide my purchases. My opinion is my own, and they didn't get a good review just because of the discount. Google AMZ Review Trader if you want discounts on stuff too!"
4.0,"Comes in a cute, small pink zippered carry case.  Good quality strapless bra. Fit exactly as described.  Only flaw was the sticky stuff needs to be a little more sticky.  But good overall."
4.0,"I really like these socks.<br />They're very comfortable, fit fine, and the color matches my shoes (Helly-Hansen) perfectly.<br />I just wish they were longer. Three or four more inches up the calf, and they would be perfect.<br />Does the manufacturer read these reviews? I know that it's been mentioned elsewhere."
4.0,"I was surprisingly impressed with how plush and soft the yarn is in this hat. I got the purple one and it really is a nice bright shade of medium purple. My only complaint is that it's listed as a slouchy hat comma but it's not large enough around for that.. It's long enough, but is too tight down the length of the hat to slouch really and requires a little bit of stretching and pulling for it to kind of look slouchy."
4.0,"I bought this set as a replacement for when I sent my rings off for cleaning or sizing. It looks very similar to the set I have, however, up close, you can definitely tell that it's not real. Good price and decent quality for a replacement set if you are going on vacation or something and don't want to ruin your real set."
4.0,cute.  daughter loved it.  ran on the smaller size .
4.0,Nice blouse. Just runs small. I wear an XL. I bought my normal size and it‚Äôs too tight. Order a size bigger for comfort. It‚Äôs really pretty though. I‚Äô have to return but wish I didn‚Äôt have to. For me the sleeves are too short. I thought they would cover my elbows. There is no stretch. But it is light weight and comfortable. I would order the bigger size except the sleeves are not long enough for my liking. If you don‚Äôt mind that. Get it. It‚Äôs pretty and well made.
4.0,Material is thin and slightly see through. Fit is great. Note: Mine did come with a hole in the right pocket.
4.0,"This is so pretty, but I don't know how believable it is if you're trying to fool people. I have real diamond bracelets that don't sparkle as much. The clasp is strong."
4.0,It was exactly like the ad says
4.0,"Great hat, especially if you like to garden and need to really get into bushes.  I brought this hat because I was tackling some really tough over growth, bushes , trees, vines and lots of ticks.  I really appreciated the face mask, while working in the overgrowth, Hardest part was the mask staying up over my face and nose, took a little adjusting to get it just right.  The tie to hold the hat under the chin did pull out very quickly, nothing a couple of stitches couldn't fix."
4.0,"It seemed well constructed and comfortable, the colors were vibrant and to the knees on my 5,5 height. Only issue was it was way to big on me and didn‚Äôt have much shape so it ate me up."
4.0,Little bit tight. I may just have a somewhat large head though. Beautifully made.
4.0,cute but they are a little small beware!!
4.0,I ordered two of these in Navy.  The fit could have been a little smaller for me though.  Next time I will try a medium size instead of a large.
4.0,A good gift idea
4.0,I love the way this feels as the fabric material is very soft. The style is just right for me as I like to layer clothes but this just has the look and not the weight for heat. My only complaint is that the neck/head hole is very large and it kind of droops down my chest or back depending on how I have the shirt positioned.
4.0,Great selection of colors for the price. Definitely designed for a smaller mans frame but very sleek and comfortable fit. Only issue was the two month wait for delivery from over seas.
4.0,There was a nice one based on it s price.<br />but it was too large for me.<br />the chest and breast part was larger than the bottom part and i had to return it.
4.0,"Great price for a basic watch.  Alarm, stop functions very handy; the &#34;lighted screen&#34; is virtually impossible to read except in absolute darkness.  The resin band actually feels like rubber."
4.0,"I ordered this Topmelon Women's Seamless Fitness Workout High Impact Running Sport Bra with Zipper in a size medium in the color Lake Blue. The color turned out perfectly and looks just like the picture. The back straps are a little &#34;lacier&#34; than I thought they looked like in the picture, and I'm not quite sure yet if I like that. The overall material of the sports bra is very sturdy and firm, but very comfortable. The zipper is very sturdy, and I wish it showed pictures of what it looks like when you unzip it. It has a separate inside sports bra type &#34;shell&#34; with a clasp in the front. Then, the blue zipper part zips over it. Underneath the zipper is fabric, so the zipper never actually touches your skin. That could cause some skin irritation, so I appreciate the fabric that blocks the zipper from your skin. Overall, this sports bra is very comfortable to wear, however, the only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it runs just a tad small and because it seems more like it is for looks than for actual physical use.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discounted rate from the seller in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. In no way has the seller bribed or influenced my review in a positive nature. My review is 100% my opinion and was not based on any other reviews of this product.

4.0,Nice and shiny! I liked the size & the how quickly it came...u have to wear it a while till it starts to look a bit worn to give it the &#34;real look&#34; but straight out of the box it kinda looks fake.
4.0,The plugs are great but the tunnels are slightly small.
4.0,Glasses work great when using them for gaming.  The only thing I don't like about them is they don't necessarily fit snug to my face.  I have to keep pushing them up to my face.
4.0,"I like it, it was a good deal."
4.0,One size does not fit all with this chain but it did fit. A lil confusing at first on how to wear it but otherwise very cute. You get what you pay for so don't be surprised it brakes easy.
4.0,Had to really adjust nose piece because they sit very high on bridge of the nose but very nice glasses for the price!
4.0,"I'm between the size small & medium, and the large (size) for this shirt falls under the small size.  But no problem, I like the body hugging feel and shows off my ""somewhat"" muscular build...lol."
4.0,"They are folding sunglasses for under 30 bucks. Cheap beater glasses to put in a bag. The screws stripped out of the plastic within the first couple of weeks of use. I am however very surprised to see how resilient these glasses are. I've sat on, dropped, smashed, and all but stepped on them and they haven't completely given out. Maybe I'm lucky. they look really good too."
4.0,This shirt is really pretty. it was  lil tight through the tummy. But the overall fit was good. Love the color and the back is Awesome!
4.0,"The top is a little big but was a perfect fit. I am 5‚Äô0 165 lbs, my  daughter was also able to wear it. She‚Äôs 5‚Äô4 180 lbs and fit her great."
4.0,I like these because they are easy to get in. I have a paralyzed right hand. So that‚Äôs important
4.0,"Fit slightly large, but after a few washes it did shrink to a better fit."
4.0,They are a good length and soft. My only complaint is they are a little tighter on the band part.
4.0,It's a very nice shirt. Really comfortable I would buy another.
4.0,I would have given 5 stars. They are thick and look good and soft and warm. Im definitely going to rebuy in a larger size.
4.0,Bottom fits perfect but the top is just a tad bit too small. I am 5'7 and wear a DD. Ordered a size XXL. Color is great!!!
4.0,"Very soft, not as long as it appears from the description to wear with leggings which was my intention, and the sleeves are snug but because of the material I can still wear it comfortably."
4.0,This hat is the cutest hat ever but it was way too small for my son and we ordered according to his size but I think we got sent the wrong size or their sizes are listed wrong!
4.0,Cute but bendable material. You have to squeeze to open and close so be sure to use care!
4.0,"These are a nice small hoop earrings for those I don't like them too large.  they are very cute, mine don't have a problem staying fastened."
4.0,"A couple of them came with the loop broken off,  other than that they‚Äôre cute!"
4.0,Good socks!  Used for backcountry skiiing.  No blisters.
4.0,Bringing back the old school fat laces though i'd like to see the cotton kind there were three kinds back in the day cotton weaved.and polypropylene something like that which is what these kind are they were common in the day the cotton ones were dope they have a nice look and feel to them.Next time i'll check and see if they carry the cotton kind.The price was right same as when we bought them in the 80's have ppl ask me today say i didn't think they had them anymore i said they do on amazon and i'm bringing them back. They look great on some old school suede Pumas Adiddas and Converse.
4.0,"I bought these for a party for my teenage daughter and friends--they were an instant hit.  They were leaving the party after night-fall and they all wore them.  I had some extras that I sent out to younger nieces and nephews, and they also pleased that age group of course.  Great fun at a fantastic price."
4.0,"Wore as a halloween costume. the bottom chain broke but the top chains stayed together perfectly. This isn‚Äôt the bottoms fault tho, i sized down to have good cleavage as that was more important. so the bottoms were too small for me so that was expected. overall it looked great"
4.0,"This is a very cute shirt and the colors are really pretty.  Its very light weight and see through so you have to wear something under it if you don't want people to see through it.  It seem a bit wider than it is long, but the length does go to below belt loops on pants.  It didn't seem as long as it looks in the pic.  Overall it's a cute shirt that looks good with shoes and boots."
4.0,I bought this at Walmart for $5 and they fit super nice and are really comfortable!
4.0,"Great Looking shirt, Runs a touch small, Gave it 4 stars bc I live in Florida and sweated big time. All in all though, a 4th of July winner"
4.0,Sent as a present
4.0,"Super comfortable and cute. The only issue is that it fades pretty quickly with washing but for the price, it's still a good deal."
4.0,"Nice, light, comfortable, cushy.  These shoes are great for indoor use and use at the water park.  They are not heavy duty, so I do not expect them to last long with regular use.  For the price, these are good.  They met my needs of having a lightweight , comfy, slip-on shoe to bring on vacation.<br /><br />Update: Wow....it is now August 2022 and I still have these!  There is no more traction on the bottom, but the shoes are intact!  I keep them by the door if I need quick slip on shoes for short distances."
4.0,"My husband really liked these, simple yet very lovely design."
4.0,"The size of these is as expected, but the leather just looks kinda cheap,  just not finished.  They are very dull looking, I wasn't expecting that.  They will work for what I need them, but disappointed with the look for how expensive they are."
4.0,Nice suit. Comfortable and looks good (size 14)
4.0,"Not real leather, but a very good fake! Very happy with that. Elastic smells like moth balls and is still off-gassing after 2 weeks. The size is a great medium size - not skinny, not real wide. The gold closure has a pinkish tint, so a little cheap looking there, but not too noticeable. I have a 27"" waist and the elastic fits well, not too tight, not too loose. I'm keeping it because it looks good enough for an inexpensive belt and the faux leather looks great. I don't keep anything that looks too cheap (I have champagne taste on a beer budget). It finishes off an outfit really well. More good points than bad. (This is a correction to my first review, when I thought the leather was real.)"
4.0,"This is a great deal for some lightweight, open front cardigans!  However, the design of these is pretty cheap in a few ways.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a cardigan or sweater with pockets.  I don't think ANYONE should be making them without pockets.  However, the placement of these pockets is too far back making them strange to use.  They are sewn into the side seam instead of being an extra seam where the pockets would naturally go.  Also, the hem around the collar lays seam out when you wear it.  It makes it look cheap and not finished right.  The fabric is really loose and silky.  You do need to steam it before wearing because out the package and washer it is very wrinkled.  But once I steam it before wearing it it doesn't seem to get really wrinkled during the wear.  I still highly recommend these because you aren't getting 3 cardigans for $28 anywhere else!"
4.0,Just add advertised and I love it but a link broke before I got to wear it :(
4.0,Gave this to my daughter who finished her first leg of a four year degree by completing her AA. Vey appreciated
4.0,"Only complaint is that the waist goes up really high. I'm 5'9&#34; with a really long torso and the waist sits about 4&#34; above my belly button. Other than that they are super soft, colors are great, and very comfortable!"
4.0,Love the color.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"Arrived quickly, and just as described. Thanks!"
4.0,Baby first bracelet was to big for that but the mother of the child said she will give it to her when she is about 10 years of age. The color of the gold was a bit off not sure why?
4.0,"I ordered two sets to have a lot of variety and am very pleased with them.  They have a narrow and well-sown ""hem"" around the edges, so you need to fold with that in mind if you don't want it showing, but that isn't hard to do.  Also, because of the way the fabric is, each side of the square has slightly different colors- like a front and back side of a loomed carpet. That means you have two color schemes for each one!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I am pretty sure the description said silk and they are not silk.  I honestly didn't think they would be at that price, so I wasn't really disappointed, but I think the company should describe accurately."
4.0,"Just got it today, as several reviewers suggested i went to smaller size (Medium instead of Large which my regular fit) and it went nice in terms of size. In regards to quality, it's too early to judge  but in relation to the price i'd say it's a good deal."
4.0,"These are nice to the touch, feel soft and will be gentle on baby's skin. What I don't like about them is the lack of absorbency - water/liquid slides off the material very easily. Also, liquid takes a long time to penetrate the layers (2 of them) and soak in the material. Overall I wouldn't recommend them for the purpose of being burp cloths. I am sure every parent though can easily repurpose them around the house."
4.0,Really sturdy but difficult took take links out.
4.0,Great Pun shirt<br />Go up a size if you prefer a little looser
4.0,"very cute, but it definitely fits better on smaller cup sizes"
4.0,Great value! I always liked the look of the parachute style straps bit always balked at the price of Erika's original straps. These also come in more widths. The fabric is very lush and feels very comfortable on the wrist.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they require a spring bar to install and remove compared to Nato straps. But that's more of a design complaint than one specific to this strap.<br /><br />Overall good quality for a decent price.
4.0,"I ordered a Small and honestly I need a medium bottom since my butt is perky, it pulls the front of the bikini down. It is a little too low in the front (revealing). Other than the bottom not fitting quite right, I was told in the post that you can contact the seller for a different size but was never responded to, so thats the only reason I give it a 4 star review. Now I will have to remake the bottom pair or try and make it work.<br /><br />Overall, I did not expect the tails to have strong and light wires in them. Which stay together well when you are walking in the costume. I love the small details in the fabric! The head pieces that come with the cosplay are truly beautiful and well hand crafted. This also came in the mail pretty fast. :)"
4.0,Thank you i really like Comfortable and good quality
4.0,"Nice scarf but it is not a white border like the pic shows, it's grey. I will be sending this one back only because I already bought the scarf with the grey border. Still a beautiful scarf."
4.0,"I liked the way it fit. I usually order a larger size in swimsuits than  I do in jeans, skirts, pants, etc. and I believe I ordered large in these gray capris swim wear...I am 130 lbs and 5‚Äô81/2. I wouldn‚Äôt like a tighter fit than the large. Bought for pool."
4.0,"These slippers are lightweight and easy to pack for travel.  I plan on using these in hotels when I travel.  They are machine washable, so can be kept clean.  One complaint I have is they are hard to put on if you have socks on.  Otherwise, they are nice."
4.0,"Very cute pendant. The chain has a dreadful, almost non existent clasp on it that'll probably break with a gentle tug on it. So it's definitely recommended to change out the clasp or switch to a different chain. But then again, you can't expect too much for something that cost about $1.00."
4.0,Clasp it hard to fasten otherwise love it
4.0,"Item was as described in the picture, fast delivery. I ordered a small but it has quite a bit room in the top."
4.0,I received a lot of compliments on this dress.  I wear black a lot and this was a winner to get me out of my comfort zone.
4.0,Overall a nice hat but  a bit smaller than expected
4.0,"This is for all of the people who wanted to complain and then not post any pictures of the &#34;poor quality&#34; products they received. Although the material needs to relax a little from being shipped, I think this purse is fantastic, and not because I'm some lady's young granddaughter who doesn't know any better. This purse is the same size that they advertised and of no lesser quality, especially for the price!"
4.0,"Love this piece, only issue is the link that holds cross keeps opening up."
4.0,"I needed a dusty blue susender for a baby and the suspenders matched the color in picture but the bowtie is as described, a light grey. they are not to different in color but at a close view they are different."
4.0,very happy with these glasses they came quickly in cool cases and were well received by all who saw them on my face
4.0,Great dress super comfortable and fits great!
4.0,"Use them for guests when they take off their shoes and this way they can feel comfortable walking around the house without their shoes on,"
4.0,"this small bag is convenient, light and durable, perfect for the gym! It was the exact size and description I expected."
4.0,I've got 6 credit cards and license in mine. The money is a great add on. The cards are a little hard to get out but I'm still trying to learn since I've only had this a very short time. I would recommend for a front pocket wallet.
4.0,This product looked very comfortable when I received it. Probably would have liked it but it was too small. Maybe I‚Äôll look at it again in the spring
4.0,Was suprised at the quality. Much better than I expected. My wife loves them. 4 stars for the loooooooooong wait.
4.0,Pretty good variety of color choices included. Good value.
4.0,A bit large and fur shed a little. Overall good product
4.0,"It is what it is but the pin, as with most of these style pins are weak and easily broken."
4.0,I gave this a 4 because the jacket part of the dress is not the color it shows here it is more of dark mustard color . The dress is cute how ever. I ordered a small because that is what my daughter wears and it was a little big. So you don't have to worry about ordering up a size with the dress. I would not recommend ordering down one rather.
4.0,"Lightweight and comfortable.  I ordered up a size and got a medium, as I know most Chinese clothes run small.  Medium is perfect.  I do wish the top was a little more fitted, but everything else is great.  Top is soft and stretchy.  Love that skirt portion has deep pockets.  I'm 5'6' and it hits just above my knees."
4.0,Beautiful! Fits perfectly. Wish it had safety clasps.
4.0,Good value for the money.  I was looking for earrings to match my pendant and they fit the bill.
4.0,Pretty ring. Size is correct. It wasn‚Äôt as dainty as I had hoped - the setting and stone were larger in person. It really is pretty though and I really like it.
4.0,This Wallet goes great with my Mona B Tri shoulder Bag that I also got. The sipper is a little rough and I wish there were more sleeves for my cards. I wish the sleeves were not as deep so my cards wouldn't go so far for better access. Other than that I did receive it quickly and I do like it.
4.0,"Doesn't look great on me, and a little snug in the arms and bust. Very long, but I expected that, as I am only 5 feet tall. But I sew, so altering is expected and no big deal. Not the seller's fault. Clothes shopping online is always a gamble."
4.0,Somewhat  cheap assemble but for the price what more do you want a decent product
4.0,Amazing for the price. Cute and soft
4.0,Nice replacement rings.
4.0,"Didn't see it was for an adult not child, bummer it doesn't fit my daughter"
4.0,it fitted a bit larger than expected but still looked good. I liked the texture and rich look of the fabric.
4.0,"Very cute, love the back. Other reviews led me to think it ran small so I ordered a size bigger and it's too big, but she'll grow into it. The pattern is a bit different than the picture, but looks a little vintage and my friends love it. Also, my order got lost in mail and they were very quick and efficient in getting another one shipped to me."
4.0,"Hard to go wrong with anything Casio, the only real complaint i have is with the programming menu for this item. You must use the instructions to set and it is not as intuitive as other casio watches are. It has a power saving function which is marked as a PS in the top right of the LCD display that really needs to be on other wise everytime you move your wrist to a certain angle the light will activate, really i don't see the need for this contrived function, the idea is when you twist your watch to an angle where you would look at it the light turns on. This will deplete your solar charge very quickly. It already has a light button (top right). As far as the solar generator, I have yet to purposefully set the watch in sunlight, it seems to get enough from my everyday activities to keep the charge on the HI level. (HI is what you see in the top of the LCD screen above the date or time.) The other issue is the led light that lights the LCD display is standard white/yellow and does not light up the face of the watch. at night the LCD display numbers are so small it takes time for your eyes to adjust to see what time it is and analogue is tough to pick up anyway. So, this backlight is not your typical blue/green glo you may be accustomed to. A little disappointing, that would have been icing on the cake. But this sucker is sturdy and big. I like that. I put it on a wide nylon strap from a g-shock watch and it looks and feels great. Could have been a 5 star if they had an indiglo back light."
4.0,Great short with exception of waistband.
4.0,"Due to the cost of the item, my expectations were terribly high.  It was certainly only worth it's sale price."
4.0,nice quality... nice design..
4.0,"Great no-see sock feet for my cute sneakers. I‚Äôm a 9.5M in women‚Äôs shoes and these are a tiny bit big around the ankle in the back of the heel on me. On first wearing before wash, they tended to sink down in the back of my shoe."
4.0,"Frankly, I ordered them as part of a gag gift so they're not likely to find their way out of the pkg."
4.0,I was looking for a small reliable solar charger for AA and AAA rechargable batteries in the event of power loss. I tried this equipment on 2 less than sunny days to see how it would do. After the second day I removed the AA's (4) and put them on my ac battery charger to see if they were charged since there is no indicator when the batteries are charged on this device. Ordinarily on my ac charger it takes 24 hours to charge. These charged in less than 6 hours. I will test these again under sunny conditions but for now I believe this device will do the job.
4.0,The size and Color combo are awesome!!!<br />However I didn't give it 5 stars cause it came with a bit of a musty smell:( that doesn't seem to be going away
4.0,It works well for me over most sleeveless garments.  Hides the arms but not too hot.
4.0,"love this dress, but it's much more modest than the photos show. it's not nearly as low scoop necked as it's pictured"
4.0,"So overall I am pleased with this purchase.  I gave it 4 stars because the string, and I do say string that is supposed to keep it tight across your face is VERY thin and the tightening thing doesn't hold it super tight.  It loosens so I constantly adjust it.  When the time some I will just put in a better, more shoestring like tie and a better thing to secure it.  I love the look of it.  The material is nice and you get 2 filters for it that do cover my nose and mouth.  They are thicker so this is fine for walking but might be hard to breathe if you are running or something but everyone is different.  Over all it is good and works."
4.0,"Looks huge,just for guys"
4.0,"Cute, it's a little rough on the ear so I'm not able to wear daily."
4.0,"For those of us bigger girls out there, this cover up is just a tad small. I‚Äôm happy with it, but wish there would‚Äôve been a plus size option. With a long torso plus a larger chest and belly this is almost a little too short in the front for my taste. The cover up definitely gets caught on things and the strings get pulled. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal or super noticeable when those strings get pulled, but if you don‚Äôt want that to happen at all, get a different cover up."
4.0,The material is very stretchy.Its a good thing for full breast or wider top area.Not for smaller top area
4.0,"I liked the fabric and the fit and the fact that it stretches , however , it runs small and short. Just size up. I would say 1 size up is all you would need..."
4.0,This fits really well and is decent quality for the price. The string already came out but just feed it back in with a needle. True to color.
4.0,"Not the most fashionable, but has everything I need in a wallet. I love that it's a wristlet."
4.0,"I really like the tuxedo shirt. It fits well in the sleeves and the arm length. It is a tad large in the body, but I will be wearing a vest over it and i believe it will be fine."
4.0,"Super cute dress. I'm 5'1"" and about 128 lbs and a small fit well. The length is just a tad bit long for my height so if you have some shoes with an inch or two, wear them. The material feels so good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the dress Itself is see-through ( I got the white one) so a slip or underdress is probably needed. Other than this the dress is perfect!"
4.0,"cute bag,bigger than I expected which is a plus!"
4.0,Very nice sunglasses really wanted a clip on type<br />So I didn't get the look I wanted
4.0,"My previous K.Bell socks were great.  This pack has a defective sock in it.  JooJooBeach won't refund or replace since I'm out of their warranty period, since it took me a while before I needed to open the new socks.  But JooJooBeach bought the socks at Costco so they can easily return them.  I learned that by contacting K.Bell directly.  And K.Bell Company itself is very generous and has offered to replace my socks, though they have no responsibility in this at all.  Really nice of K.Bell!  So, yes, I recommend K.Bell socks."
4.0,"Other than that issue, I love it.  I am worried that the flimsy looking hooks might snap off."
4.0,Variety isn‚Äôt wonderful - duplicates were in the package.  Cute and classy
4.0,"I ordered this because of the price. I was excepting to be very low quality, but I was happy with it. I've had several compliments on it."
4.0,serves it's purpose--the sizing is very very small
4.0,Good material good fit!
4.0,Pretty dress that fit everywhere for me except the neck. The neck didn't lay flat and puckered. Looked like it could use some taking in. The green was a dark blue green and the fabric was a medium weight 97% cotton and 3% spandex. Definitely a modest style if it works for you.
4.0,It‚Äôs a little thin and the waist band wrinkles but good for the money you pay!
4.0,"I needed these so badly for my water therapy. I can wear a medium if it stretches.  I bought a large, thinking they were going to save me.  No one sells shorts in january. But they were so tight, I couldn't breath. The material n quality is fantastic."
4.0,"It was a Christmas gift for your boyfriend, he liked it, we just have to get it sized yet. It's a very nice looking watch!"
4.0,"I gave this product a four instead of a five because the fabric looked dull. It was the jet black fabric that one would expect from a new garment. However, it is still a very beautiful dress."
4.0,Bought this for my husband who has been looking for weeks for a manly clutch bag. Other we've seen in the mall were just a little larger than accordion wallets. This is taller and wider but still slim to carry. Not shown in the picture is the hand strap on the other side. My husband uses this instead of the side strap.
