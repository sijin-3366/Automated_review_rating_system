3.0,Decent material and workmanship but sized too small for US standards.
3.0,"I really want to like this bra. It looks so comfortable and the fabric is great. Unfortunately, I think I should have gotten a large because it is rather tight on me (and I don't consider myself large chested). This makes getting it on and off a bit of a challenge. I also had to take the liners out of the cups because they would not stay in the proper place and kept sliding around on me. For me, it is more comfortable without them anyway and I still feel like I have plenty of support. The fabric is great at absorbing sweat and washes very well."
3.0,Needed the next size!
3.0,Bulky. As all previous models the thermometer is useless.  The watch has to be taken off your wrist for over 45 minutes to get any reasonably accurate reading.<br />Mannual is a nightmare to read.  I think this is a result of way too many features that most people do not need or care about. Frustrating to access features.
3.0,too large on face for me
3.0,Needed for a high school play.  Worked perfectly!
3.0,"Great casual dress.<br />Feels like jersey material, nice and stretchy. Has pockets which I love!<br />Only con is it has seem running across the chest. I can’t wait figure out if it’s supposed to go under my breast or across. If it put it below, a lot of my chest and cleavage shows. If I put it above my breast, it looks a little funny. But I still think it’s good for price, pockets, and something to wear casually.<br />*I tried attaching a photo but it won’t allow me from my phone?*"
3.0,"My God they are only Plastic inserts, how bad can you screw it up?"
3.0,"A bit disappointed. The charm and connection to loop are great, but the saying on it is not readable."
3.0,"Good quality and great price but size runs really small.  Given that it’s made in China and Asian sizes as way smaller, I ordered a large (I’m a medium) and it still fit really small (zipper wouldn’t close all the way) and it was too tight around the waist.  I’m 5’3 and 135lbs.  This skirt had to be at least 2 sizes up to fit me properly & comfortably.  As for the length, it fit above the knee on me."
3.0,Plamayplluu
3.0,was too small on the arms and rather not he exact look expected
3.0,I could not figure out how to set it up. It is really hard to see. For what I needed it for it is fine.
3.0,I feel it runs a little small.  I'm keeping it and will wear to work but not sure I'd wear it socially.  The color is beautiful though.
3.0,I am on the fence with these. I bought them at the same time as the eagle creek spectre bag and I love the size of the medium. Its the perfect size to fit in my 19liter bag. The zipler does not compare to the Eagle creek brand. It got jammed the first time I tried using it. Also i wish there was a second zipper on the other side to store smaller undergarments or dirty laundry. I do like how the zipper opens all the way around as opposed to tue Eagle Creek one. I may hang onto it for kids use. Not sure yet. It might be better off for me to spend a bit more for the quality.
3.0,Nice material but should definitely go a size or two smaller than your usual.
3.0,Don't care for this material for the beach.  Nice color.
3.0,"The complaint I have with this otherwise sturdy-built measuring cone is it doesn't work for smaller wrists. Fortunately, my size is the very top &#34;ledge&#34; - 6.67&#34;. Some of the people I make bracelets for have smaller wrists, so I can't use it for them."
3.0,"The wide-leg flare sweatpants with pockets come in multiple color options.  The size chart should be used to insure selection of proper size and fit.  Although the size guide was use, the sweatpants were too long by three inches and the waist a little too tight.  The price value was higher than expected for casual sweatpants.  Shows as described on the Amazon online store.<br /><br />Design & Style: Good<br /><br />Quality of material: Good<br /><br />Stitching & Sewing:  Good<br /><br />Alignment for style type:  Good<br /><br />Fit for size: Very Poor – Too long, waist too tight<br /><br />Cost/Price Value: Higher than expected for casual sweatpants<br /><br />Shows as described:  Yes"
3.0,The leotard runs small. Not enough stretch for taller boy frames.
3.0,"Im a medium in all shirts and that even leaves them a little baggy sometimes. I was so excited about this top! It got here and i put it on and it was snug, a little too small. Still wearable! So i went to look in the mirror and LOW AND BEHOLD both my titties are there for the whole world to see! It is completely see through and too small to comfortably wear a brallette underneath it. I will be returning it and getting a larger size... hopefully this one wont expose my whole titties to the world!  I reccomend getting 1 or 2 sizes larger than your normal size. If you go braless like me this is probably not it for you."
3.0,"Other than running a little small, it is comfy and I find it pretty absorbent."
3.0,The design is great for the price the hat is not made for big heads and it has a great vintage color but my only problem is the bill is not aligned with the hat itself. The bill was stitched on badly and its sideways looks kinda funny.
3.0,"They look great, feel ok, but did not seem like they would break in enough to be comfortable.  They are also quite heavy. For that price, I need them to work. Returned.  Very disappointed, because it's hard to find great vegan footwear."
3.0,Nice bracelets but not the best quality.
3.0,"I bought the xlarge, but it runs small for a busty person."
3.0,"It's not that its a bad hat ... actually in some ways it's nice. Came a bit ""bent"" but can be re-shaped fairly easily. The only real issue is that it doesn't necessarily look like a ""real"" hat. A little like a costume hat. But if you want something casual and not too dressy, this can work."
3.0,"The sizes are not specific enough for me. I ordered a large in a different color, and it makes me look like a child planning in her mother’s clothes. I ordered a medium, and it’s too small to drape properly. Very sad about that because it is as cute as the pictures in the listing!"
3.0,"I thought this would be cute for Valentine’s Day.  It fit so snug & so tight it was though it was for a child. It was horrible & a gross disappointment. There was so much spandex in it, I might as well have bought a girdle.  Terribly disappointed."
3.0,"Shipping was quick. The fabric smells like a wet dog. You can tell it’s cheap but it fits nicely. I’m 5’4”, 140lbs and Small fits right."
3.0,Fits well but was hung too much for my liking. The fabric is thicker which is nice considering it's rayon but felt like it was pulling me down and falling off.
3.0,not so impressed with fit...
3.0,"The quality is low, the fit is a tad too small. You will really only want these for occasional costume purposes. They will NOT last for frequent wear."
3.0,They are pretty once you get them in but over time these will break with all the movement on the back require to slide them on
3.0,SOME LOOK REALLY GOOD QUALITY OTHERS DON'T
3.0,Perfect length on arms and legs but the zipper is plastic junk. I was unable to wear this because the zipper was stuck. My husband used needle nose pliers to help it to zip up but it would not budge
3.0,It serves it's purpose ... But I should have ordered a size up
3.0,"Material good only problem never looks like you removed it from your suitcase! The folds never unfold. I took it out of the bag it came in straightened them both out, left them for a day and a half....they still looked exactly the same as they did when they came out of the bag. Creases !!! Odd shape!! Sent them right back."
3.0,"It arrived with one of the interior tank top bands broken, and the belt isn't affixed on the front so it tends to slide out of place. I love the style of the dress and it fit my waist/length fine, but it just doesn't fit my broader shoulders.<br />5'4&#34;, 145 lbs."
3.0,"The idea for these straps are great, I have longer curly hair, and find that when I wear sunglasses with nose pieces whenever I try to prop them on my head when I dont need them the nose piece becomes tangled and nearly impossible to get out of my hair!  I was hoping these would help with that problem.  Unfortunately, my favorite pair of sunglasses have too thick of a stem to fit into the rubber tips of these straps. I did try them with an old pair of glasses with a smaller stem and found that they are easy to use and very secure feeling.  I would imagine they would last a long time with the right sized glasses.  Since this came in a pack of multiple straps I will share these with my husband and family members, I am sure some of them will have the right sized glasses for these straps! I was provided this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest feedback. All of my reviews are my own unbiased, honest opinions.  I do not receive monetary compensation for my feedback and I am not required to leave positive reviews"
3.0,Supper cute my kids loge them but never recieved bracelets
3.0,Not anti fog at all!!!
3.0,"Colors appear heathered in advertised pics, but the black I ordered came solid, not heathered. Listed as a sweatshirt, but it is actually a very thin tee shirt. And not long enough to cover my rear when wearing leggings, as I had hoped (but I’m 5.9, so length may be perfect for others)."
3.0,"I thought maybe the largest size would fit me based on the measurements,  but it was much too snug in the ribcage. My cup size fit in the dress,  but the band size left me, literally breathless. I am probably 38D-40C for reference. It's a very cute beachy dress that would be great on someone with the right fit."
3.0,They are good glasses but the red seemed a little to bright for me. Im use to the blood red that our flag has. Other than that they are okay.
3.0,"These sunglasses look great and you can't beat the price. I have received many compliments.  They feel solid and seem like they will last. The only downside is the lenses aren't very dark, so if it is really bright you might still be squinting. For this reason I can only give 3 stars."
3.0,"Pretty anklet, just wish it was a little smaller."
3.0,"These are very cute, but are about what you'd expect in quality for the price.  They are not good to drive with, as there is too much reflection off the inside of the lenses.  They are dark enough that I have to take them off to read any electronic device, like my car's nav system or texts from my cell phone.  I bought them mostly for fun when out at the lake and beach, and they were good for that.  I also ran with them, and they were comfortable for that."
3.0,"This purse is super cute in the Rose Red color but a huge pain to use.  I ordered the smaller size, which is still fairly large.  The middle zipper slouches so horribly that it is basically useless.  Also, the straps are not as comfortable as they might look in the photo.  The straps are very snug around the shoulder. Further, the strap &#34;handles&#34; do not open up the purse, so when you go to open your purse, you basically have to part the canvas with your hands.  This purse would be better if it had no middle compartment, and if the strap handles actually opened the purse.  I haven't used the separate strap yet, so that might help with comfort, but this purse isn't as great as I thought it would be."
3.0,grog
3.0,"i returned the product.  is as advertised, but not exceptional, a bit thin, light, possibly better value for the money elsehwere"
3.0,"This could be an awesome jacket - but it misses the mark in a few places.  It certainly makes one wonder if the quality of Orvis products is trending lower.  First, as other reviewers have noted, the zipper is poor.  It reminds me of cheap metal zippers of the 1950's.  It takes two hands working carefully together to zip this jacket.  Come on Orvis - times have moved on!  Secondly, the &#34;insulation&#34; is paper thin and only extends from your neck down to your navel.  There is no insulation in the bottom third (13&#34;) of the jacket.  I can understand not insulating the bottom few inches - but this is just being cheap.  Finally, you would expect a $300 ($200 on sale) jacket to have an inside pocket.  This has none.  I suggest looking elsewhere for a good jacket."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful.  I love the way it pulls you in.  However, I don't like how it compresses my backside."
3.0,"The swimsuit is cute, but the material is very thin and the bottoms are somewhat see through!  I am hoping to return the suit soon."
3.0,way big in the sleeve
3.0,I'm extremely disappointed with the hat being crushed.
3.0,This scarf is cute but SO fluffy and huge I honestly feel awkward wearing it.
3.0,"They’re definitely cute, but a couple of the chain loops were badly scratched. Material composition feels cheap, I know they’ll tarnish and chip easy. I removed them from their original loops and put them on my existing keychains chains"
3.0,"I am normally a size 6, but  I ordered a large based on the size chart just to be on the safe side.  Even the large is small and tight and rubs under my armpits on both sides beacuse it rises up so high.  I usually don't post pictures with my reviews, but this was SO SMALL, I had to post pictures to show how tiny it is.  I would exchange for a lrger size, because it is kind of cute, but there is NO EXTRA LARGE."
3.0,"This shirt is nice, but it runs VERY small.  I’m normally a size 4 and a 34B.  I needed a large."
3.0,I was not satisfied with the color of the letters on the shirt. It is hard to tell they are dark green-they look more black or dark blue.
3.0,"These came to me with seams unraveling. I was able to cute the excess strings off, so they are not a total loss. They comfy and cute, but very very thin. I will only wear these at home."
3.0,"I guess this jacket is okay. The sleeves are a little short ((I ordered an XXL bc i wanted it big)) and tight, but that may just be me? ((I usually wear a Large)) It smelled kind of weird ((kind of like chlorine and fire crackers??)) I was expecting the color to be really gross and kind of turquoise but it's pretty true to the picture. The pockets are small and the buttons are dysfunctional  since there's no holes. I probably would've been really pissed with the quality of this item if it was more than $30, but you get what you pay for. I'll probably end up wearing it tbh"
3.0,Not sized correctly. I really likes this top. Disappointed.
3.0,Fgdxhgbj
3.0,Heavy & Cute but the clips that go into the hair fall off/came apart during the first wear.  Disappointed.
3.0,The quality was not what I was looking for. Sent back
3.0,Nice apron but the letter T is missing from the word don't. 🤔🧐
3.0,"Beautiful studs, but I found the post to be too short."
3.0,"The winder works perfectly, the only thing is that you cannot adjuta the different levels that the box has to wind up the watches."
3.0,Was sent the wrong style dress. Thankfully it for and worked out in the end. It's a bit difficult to zip over the ribbon/belt.
3.0,"I love the frames, but, the frames are made for smaller faces."
3.0,"I love this earpiece! it is a solid well-made cuff. Unfortunately, it is too small for my ear so I will be returning."
3.0,"I've been looking everywhere for a button free pullover flannel shirt.  I like the style.  However like other reviews, the material is stiff and itchy, and most importantly NOT FLANNEL, which traditionally is a soft fabric.  It looks like flannel, feels like an uncomfortable dress shirt.  Not sure if I'll keep it, just because there is nothing else out there in a similar style for now."
3.0,The times came off the cloves easily/  Glue not strong enough
3.0,The color was not as expected or shown in the picture
3.0,the width is good for my wide face
3.0,"I thought from the picture that this was a deep coral with lavender/blue flowers.  It's a light red/coral with purple flowers.  The purple really stands out!  There are also tiny pink flowers that don't go with any of the other colors. The light yellow leaves are nice.  The border on the bottom is nice but again the colors are just not right.  I got an XL in this.  I usually wear an XL.  This is way too big.  It's an empire waist dress - smocked elastic waist.  It's so full it makes me look pregnant!  At 67 that is not a look I want!  This dress is extremely long.  I am 5'8"" tall.  It piles around my feet.  The two sides are slit up to the knee on both sides.  The fabric is lightweight.  I like the 3/4 sleeves.  They are banded in thin elastic and aren't too tight.  The top opens with three buttons.  It's machine washable and hang or lay flat to dry.  It's made in China and is 100% polyester.  Very disappointing."
3.0,Disappointed that the hat is cotton and not corduroy.
3.0,It was very beautiful but unfortunately I’m not sure the actual pendant is fully sterling silver. It feels kinda cheap and it smells a lot like pennies which shouldn’t be the case if it’s sterling silver. I was really excited for this locket because I’ve been looking for a cute one for a while but I can’t confidently wear this without fear of it rusting or smelling so I have to return.
3.0,"I loved the feel of these, but as soon as I went to move, they fell down. They won't stay up and they're stretched out now. Disappointed."
3.0,"Not like the picture, the flowers are less detailed and the skulls are not silver the whole ring is just rose gold"
3.0,"There was not enough support in the top for the girls. I’m big busted and I don’t want them to accidentally fall out either. In the large, I needed a little more material. The extra large was perfect, but just not enough support.<br /><br />The large bottom fit. The extra large bottom was too long in the crotch."
3.0,"En apariencia y por la descripción entendí que era cuero pero al tenerlo supe que era sintético, me gusta pero me hubiera gustado más en cuero, clara que por el precio se debería de entender que no es de cuero."
3.0,"Love this necklace, very beautiful but it gets tangled very easily which makes me not enjoy wearing it..."
3.0,The material was not as expected - returned item
3.0,Cheap shoes… They have worked just fine as “Gap” shoes.. we packed his good tennis shoes for a move :-)  They haven’t lasted but that is Acceptable since my boys grow so fast
3.0,This dress is soft material but super long even with heels... I step on the bottom of the dress which makes it unsafe. I see now in the picture the model is stepping on the dress and that is exactly how it fits... It is very low cut but with a camisole is cute... I put a belt on to pull up the dress so I am ok with it... I would not purchase again.
3.0,Size was right but it was supposed to be a 3 pack and only received one pair so I am returning.
3.0,I haven't tried it on yet but I guess it will be just fine.
3.0,I ordered larger based on reviews - A little too large but not a big deal. I like loose tops. My ONLY dislike it that one of the holes on this shirt is right over my nipple which is kind of weird and uncomfortable. I wear a top under it but wish I didn't have to.
3.0,"Adorable! It's your standard scrub with an iron-on, but when it comes to dogs you have to love it anyway. The only problem I found is that it fits smaller than average."
3.0,Product is good but little lose on my face.
3.0,"I absolutely love this design. I find it's easy to put in and take out. My only complaint is that when I sleep with it in, if I lay on my side with the piercing, it slightly bruises my ear and hurts it. Nothing a little common sense couldn't fix though by just flipping the tree over so the flat side is against my ear while I sleep 😉"
3.0,"Presentation goes a long way when selling jewelry.  This product came packaged much like I would expect plastic costume jewelry to be packaged, it looked utterly cheap.  I realize that it's not the most expensive product, but I can't imagine that a proper jewelry box couldn't be included.  Also, the chain was knotted up when received, likely a result of the crappy packaging."
3.0,These are really great especially if you’re trying to wear a skirt in cold weather! I love them but mine broke right away. I was stretching them over my feet and legs and the bottom part got a hole in it immediately.
3.0,It just don't shine enough and it makes it look like tarnished sterling.
3.0,"These are standard everyday glasses and for the price they can be a good backup.  The lenses are very dark, I would have a problem riding my bike with them or even walking out in the daylight even!"
3.0,"These panties are beautiful but they are WAY TOO SMALL! I ordered a medium, and they fit like an XS (I'm 5'4&#34;, 120lbs). I feel like I'd have to get an XL for it to not cut into me. Too bad, they're so pretty. I returned it."
3.0,Fits at least a size too small
3.0,"Great feel, Just too big."
3.0,"Comfortable, but the hand warmer pockets are just a dot of Velcro for closure and are very high on the outside creating a weird cut effect in the waist. Slightly thin material but is comfy. Thin enough that the waist cinch tulips out away front the bottom. Not gonna return it but probably won’t buy another one when it gets threadbare."
3.0,"Probably would say don't waste your money. This dress is a cute design and has a good fit, but the material is super thin... borderline see-through. The buttons all had strings hanging off and there's bits of string poking out in a lot of places. It looks cheaply made, but I cut off all the strings poking out and it looked better."
3.0,"My daughter loves pandas, but she won't were these."
3.0,Was shorter than I wanted
3.0,Ordered a medium expecting it to be a bit tight based on the size chart but it is a little loose.  Quality of garmet was good.
3.0,"I like the sweater overall, but the wine color is actually more red than burgundy like it looks in the picture."
3.0,They are just okay. I bought 1 pair for me and 1 for my friend. They are very stretchy and don't feel like compression socks. The design I'd cute just wish they fit better.
3.0,Almost squeezed myself into this dress. Color is spot on but that's it.  Nice weight to the material. But fit like a medium!
3.0,"I always like strip shirts so I got this blouse. I purchased a size M, it fits fine. (I'm about 5' 5'' and 135 lbs.) The shoulder parts are a bit tight since I have wider shoulders. So that was expected. The material is soft. Made of 95% polyester and 5% spandex. The tag doesn't say where it's made. So I am guess it's made in China. One thing I like about this blouse is it's length.<br />*I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review."
3.0,Shirt is very cute and the right size but it’s short. Not a long enough shirt at all so I recommended sizing up. Okay product for the price. I haven’t washed it yet and I’m sure it will shrink some more so overall my daughter will get to wear maybe a couple of times before her midriff starts popping out.
3.0,A little disappointed I thought there was a little logo on the front but there is not and color isn't as bright as pictured
3.0,these are quite oversized
3.0,"This is a unique looking dress and that's what made me buy it. The inside is like a fleece material. This is definitely a winter dress. It fits as expected. It is a cool dress but when I tried it on it didn't look very flattering on me so I never wore it out yet and don't think I ever will. Seeing the bow in person, it's a bit much I think. I mean I'm sure this dress looks good on other women but it's not for me."
3.0,Size not accurate. Poor quality.
3.0,"3x was still a little small. Good stretchy material so I think we can make it work, but I am a little mad that the belt got left out. I saw pictures with others that had a belt, so I don't know why we didn't get one. Overall it does look like the picture minus the belt in our case."
3.0,"Some people will like this very much. For me, is of limited use.<br />  Watch arrived in sealed box, which I like, especially for electronic items. It was also set to the correct time which was a nice touch. Not much set-up was required.<br />  I like the direct access to the A, B, & C modes because I do not like cycling through multiple modes (on any device) with one button because I think there is a better way.  I chose this model because the temperature is displayed on the home screen making it unnecessary to press any buttons. Even though  I could read clearly the temperature digits on the images on the description page, in reality, those digits are too small and I can not read them. In no mode is the temperature  displayed in the larger digits, i.e. where the time is shown. Some of the other symbols are so small that I can not even tell what they are.  Allow the user to switch the value shown in the larger digits.<br />  The EL backlight is never bright enough on any watch I have ever had. I would like someone to make a watch that is not BACKlit, but FRONTlit, with bright led's, lEd's. I would not mind changing the battery more often if I could actually read the digits in the dark. And if the battery will be changed more often, why not make a battery compartment instead of having to unscrew the back and almost assuredly destroy the seal which on other watches has been quite easily damaged.<br />  The alarm tone is entirely not loud enough - I can barely hear it in the house, but out on the street with background noise, I would never hear it. With the alarm so quiet, why not include a vibration as in a mobile phone. I used to have a watch that flashed the light with the tone during an alarm. I really miss that watch.<br />  The compass mode reverts automatically to the home page after a minute. If I am using the compass I would want it to remain in that mode until I am done. Also, the compass can point to only 16 directions, so there is a 22.5 degree margin of error (360 / 16). Gives the general direction; not so accurate.<br />  Another reviewer mentioned also that the light does not stay on long enough to cycle through the modes. To make the watch do so would seem such an easy fix: just reset the light timeout if a button is pressed while the light is on.<br />  Some user customization ability would be nice also. For example, the PED  mode has multiple values (which again require scrolling through with one button). The first value displayed is always 'number of steps'. How far I went is of more interest to me than how many steps it was, but how far is the third value in ped mode. Someone  else may care more about calories used, the last value displayed. But once leaving the PED mode, returning to the home page, and then entering the PED mode again, the first value displayed is still 'number of steps'. Allow the user to set the default order.<br />Seems like a nice watch - has much potential, but I think could be programmed better to make it more useful."
3.0,"The material of this SCARF is nice -  the reason i dont like it is that the description of the item stays &#34;CARDIGAN&#34; i bought this thinking that it was it was. This is no way a CARDIGAN - this is nice over sized  scarf/shall. I ended up returning it because it wasn't what i was looking for, other than that it was made nice  -  i just wish they would change the TITLE OF THE ITEM to be more in line with what they are actually selling."
3.0,"Picture is deceiving, looks like the whole scarf is plaid, but only plaid on the outer edge, and lighter weight material then expected."
3.0,I have the exact model and have warn it four years so I have a direct comparison. The recent purchase (same brand and model) was of lower quality in that the weave was irregular with some frayed straw ends. The appearance otherwise is the same but I am a little disapointed.
3.0,Fits beautifully but the &#34;gold&#34; is rose gold!
3.0,soft and feels good
3.0,"This is a review for: SmartKnitKIDS Compresso-T Deep Pressure Sensory Compression Undershirt<br />I am unable to actually review this product fairly because it was returned, therefore, I gave 3 Stars for each product category.  I gave 5 Stars for Packaging because the item arrived safely and timely.  My 5 year old granddaughter has to wear a torso brace. She wears a shirt under it to prevent the brace from chafing and for her comfort.  My son was trying to find a cooler alternative to the tops she wears in the winter.  I’m always on the lookout for specific items she uses, so I ordered this shirt.  I believe the item description was on point; however, until the actual article can be seen, it’s difficult to evaluate one specific area of importance, i.e., the material.  In this instance, the material was too thick FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER’S need.  This is in no way a reflection on the article itself.  My son said the top was well made, the sizing was accurate, and the material was soft and comfortable.  However, when my granddaughter tried it on under her brace, it was too thick.  Therefore, the item was returned without problems.  (Thank you Amazon Prime for simplifying online purchases and returns.) This review was written by LynKin<br /><br />Note: My granddaughter is 37”.  I’m not sure of her weight, probably 26-33 lbs."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed with how thin the fabric of the garment was, despite having 2 layers to it. I would recommend it if you'll be wearing a swim suit underneath it.  If not invest in a slip dress for underneath it.  Unfortunately my white underwear showed through like it was crystal clear, and going commando wasn't an option for that day, even if it had been, you still would have seen everything...."
3.0,"I really liked this bag at first.  It is so roomy for it's size.  I'm able to fit a phone, wallet, make up and other things easily.  My only problem was the little gold balls on the top wore a hole in the vinyl after only a few weeks.  I was very upset with the quality.  The color is just as shown and it is a box type shape that really holds a lot."
3.0,The wrong color items came and it faded a lot  after washing even with cold water . The right size and reasonable cost.
3.0,"The sweater is huge. I use it for workouts now to help me sweat, but wouldn't wear it in public."
3.0,Bit tight<br />Poorly made great price
3.0,"I very lightly used this (super cute) purse for less than a year and the strap broke at one end, with no way to sew it back on. :( I'll use the bag itself as a travel container for toiletries or something, but I'm sad it didn't last as long as I would have hoped."
3.0,I got these jeans two sizes bigger and they still fit my legs too tight by the leg holes.
3.0,"Darling shoes, just not made for comfort so you're good to get these if your going to wear them somewhere that you'll be sitting more than walking."
3.0,Picture showed round but when they arrived they were princess cut. Good quality for the price.
3.0,"I love this dress! 5'1 and 155, I purchase a large and it fit PERFECT!! UPDATE: I ordered in TWO of these in different patterns. I have to return ONE of these dresses, because of the zipper! It will Not Zip UP or DOWN, the zipper is just stuck in the middle of dress & I wanted this dress too!! I am afraid to REorder and I hope the OTHER dress's zipper is good! I am changing to give 3 stars, because I had issues with one of the dress zipper."
3.0,"It is nice, just buy one size down. Fits large."
3.0,"I was please about the appearance, but it wss too small. I had to double check the sizing tag. It was the size I ordered, was at least a size too small."
3.0,"Now don't get me wrong, this is a nice necklace BUT the etching is so lite that it's hard to see. Should have been etched in a deeper white/grey or in black. Also feels like it will wear off fast with any friction."
3.0,"They are not stone. But they look beautiful, but they don’t work for me."
3.0,Really like the design and price of the Howk  Chrongraph watch; However the min hand came loose and  moves around just by turning the watch on edge; it has not been dropped so do not know why this happened; not worth getting repaired and the warranty is over.
3.0,It was on time but the bracelets are poor quality
3.0,"I liked the stretchy fabric, but I'm hippy and the buttons strained in their holes.  Had to return.  This is a tight-fitting pencil skirt."
3.0,"This is a thin, wool blend sock with a colorful design. I like the pattern very much. Do note that these are sized, so check you size before ordering or you may end up with a “man’s” sock that fits a fifth grader! Recommended, but pay close attention to sizing."
3.0,It was difficult to find a way to use. I bought it for putting on some of my bracelets.
3.0,"Very easy to breathe when on, a little long for the ear hoops."
3.0,Comfortable but fades fast.
3.0,"Nice shirt, but I wear a medium and ordered a large...still too small"
3.0,Not the most amazing shirt- surprisingly runs large. But it's not bad. I made it work.
3.0,The color seems to be a little bit off in the shades and the neck collar is not the same solid black as it is in the picture it is yellow and for whatever reason looks really odd to me
3.0,Didn't like pattern so much after I got it. Kept it but honestly it's not one of my go to tops.
3.0,"A bit flimsy, but cute."
3.0,"This was a little misleading as it reads ""FunisFun Beer Mitten Gloves"" in the title, I ordered it and it is actually only one glove. The material is great and everything else was as described, just disappointed that it wasn't two gloves."
3.0,"You could hardly call them ""compression"" tank tops, they hardly put any compression on at all. The fabric is very thin and it's easy to see through it. The colors are fairly nice, although it should be noted how bright the yellow one is. No joke, it is brighter than a traffic visibility vest. You can be seen from space when wearing it. Do not underestimate the yellow shirt."
3.0,"Armlength is a little bit short, but I will probably end up pulling them up anyway."
3.0,I was super excited to finally find a shirt in my size only to receive it and have it be super tight on me! Definitely does not fit like a 1x. So bummed out!
3.0,"Lenses are thinner than OEM. While they are quite clear with a similar &#34;pop&#34; effective when looking through them, they also produce a &#34;rainbow&#34; effect when looking at reflective (glass) surfaces. It's even worse if you're looking at a reflective electronic surface like a cellular phone, tablet, or car radio screen."
3.0,Cheaply made but ok.<br />Not the best fit.
3.0,"Well made, but if ordered to normal size definitely nor a loose fit as described."
3.0,"For the price of these tops, not worth the price. Seems cheaply made."
3.0,"Pretty, comfortable, but way too big."
3.0,"It said a 9 or 11 would fit me. I’m a 13 to 14. It was too small as I thought. I then tried to order the 13’s and they were literally the same exact size. I was really disappointed. They are very pretty jeans though. I then tried to order the 15’s they fit, but were still just a little too tight on my stomach. The 15’s are a lot darker and go up way passed the stomach. They are also long for my height. I had to roll them up a bit. I gave 3 stars from how pretty they are, but didn’t give more because of the sizes being so wrong. They basically do 9 to 13 as one size."
3.0,"Cute. Runs very, very small. You definitely want to order 2 sizes up. The sleeves are very tight. Nice, bright color."
3.0,"I have a very similar pair that broke so wanted to replace them. These are so small. The lenses are much smaller and even the frame and fit were small. I could get them on, but they were snug and looked silly with smaller lenses. They literally fit my 2 year old without being loose and falling  so I just gave them to her. I would have got her a pair anyway so I'm not mad haha. But I would be otherwise."
3.0,Exactly as pictured  I do have a little stomach so because it’s so good fitting it does show all of the curves wanted and unwanted lol
3.0,"i loved these shoes the first few times i wore them. they fit well and they're really pretty. i got lots of compliments on them. then, after less than 5 wears multiple jewels have fallen out. it's so disappointing, because these shoes aren't cheap. i'm glad i got them on sale because they are not worth the full price."
3.0,Very cute but had an awful smell when I opened it. Febreezed it and now it is perfect for fall!
3.0,This could be made better but will do for my kid who loves DS cosplaying. Kinda cheaply made and could have made it myself if I had more time to do so. Not sure if it's a keeper. Undecided.
3.0,"The description reads &#34;antique&#34; which I expected to be more brushed and less shiny.  They are also smaller than I expected.  I thought they would be about the size of a dime. On the plus side, they sent 11 instead of 10 and they said it would take 4 weeks and they arrived in two weeks."
3.0,Not sure if this little compression is very beneficial.<br /><br />Admittedly I am used to compression socks with much more compression. I can feel a big difference during the run or putting them on after a run for recovery.<br /><br />These on the other hand after  couple minutes into the run and you don't even notice they're on. And that just doesn't seem very beneficial.<br /><br />The one Plus to having  less compression is the socks due go on and off very easily. The other pause is they are extremely inexpensive for compression socks.<br /><br />So if you want light compression inexpensive socks these are for you.
3.0,"Cute, but looks like costume jewelry for sure.  It's what you'd expect at the price.  I've worn it a few times and haven't had problems with clasp or chain yet. Arrived much quicker than the expected delivery date."
3.0,"The coat is too small!!! The size is not medium, it is extra small. My American size is 2  I can send it back, because I have no use for it."
3.0,This top has a different pattern and shape from the picture.
3.0,I like the swimsuit but it is a little to big. I went by the chart but I am going to have it taken up.
3.0,"Bracelet is cute, however it it pretty small so I would recommend it for preteens, teens or adults qith small wrists."
3.0,It’s ok for the price. Too short for me
3.0,"adorable top, but it runs super small"
3.0,The leg part fits but down in the sole and ankle is a little loose. I like them cuz they will go good with skinny jeans
3.0,"I lost one of these and wanted to replace it. I think this product is cheap, which is fine. I just wanted a slightly nicer product and will keep looking."
3.0,"I saw a review about the smell of this shirt before I ordered it, but I assumed it was the standard chemical odor that almost all cheap clothes have. I buy almost all of my clothes from Amazon, and I'm used to that smell, so I wasn't too worried. This shirt smells ten times as bad as a normal chemically-smelling clothing purchase. It's not just the standard chemical smell either....it's a horrible, indescribable odor that I have never experienced from a piece of clothing before. There are notes of B.O., chemicals and I don't even know what else. I've never smelled anything like it to be honest. Fit is as expected and so is the quality, but the smell is so bad that just trying it on made me feel sick. Returning."
3.0,"I had a pair of sunglasses with the orange lenses for 17 years that I've been on the hunt to replace after losing them last year. I'm very petite so this is actually harder then you'd think. I got these ones because the other reviews stated they were small. We'll, they're not small enough. They look huge on my small face and the part that sits on my ears is metal and painful. I do like the look of them overall. It's just too bad they're not smaller"
3.0,La tela es de mala calidad y el tamaño yo soy M y la pedí XXL y me queda pequeña
3.0,"This is cute and fits fine, but it's not a cotton material like I thought. It's more of a thin jersey material."
3.0,Runs somewhat small. Go up a size.
3.0,I normally wear a size medium but i like for my long sleeved clothes to be a bit bigger so i ordered a Large... It fits more like a small/medium. Its not too small but i was hoping it would be a size bigger not a size smaller... Still wearable but a bit unhappy with the size
3.0,"Masks look nice, good color.<br />Good fit around nose and face.<br />No logo or manufacture info on masks.<br />All in one bag. Masks not individually packaged.<br />Piece of paper included is labeled “Qualified Certificate“, but most of it is written in Chinese."
3.0,"Disappointed it was not heavier and warmer for colder weather.  Even for our milder San Francisco winters, I will need to look for a heavier beanie as this beanie probably will not cut it."
3.0,They can be worn as undershirts but too tight for regular wear
3.0,I like them. They run a little big. They are good for the price.
3.0,It's comfortable but don't think this could handle high impact workouts.  I bought up a bandsize thinking it would be a bit snug but should have bought true too size.
3.0,The best is nice stylish love to cut but they can use better material
3.0,"Very pretty dress but it does have some flaws. The top of the dress around my chest was very loose which makes it look unflattering. This dress runs really big! I ordered a small, I’m 5’3 & 105lbs and this dress is huge on me."
3.0,Not bad quality. Very big for a more petite person. Color was not as pictured. Looked more like bubble gum pink and blue not as pretty and suttle as in picture.
3.0,Nice vest love the pockets space. Fits nicely
3.0,"Not a bad mask, but the adult size is definitely for small adults. My chin can't fit in the little chin pocket thing while still covering my nose."
3.0,they are cute just way to large for my granddaughter.
3.0,"We purchased this for a themed party for my work. My husband tried this on and it fits as expected. However, the watch chain is very fragile (he hooked it onto the vest and it broke off), so be wary of the watch accessory. He won’t be taking the watch to the party."
3.0,i like this poduct  a little tight<br />but im ok with it.
3.0,It's really nice looking but not as large as the size  listed or in the photo.
3.0,"These are very nice, but they run way small."
3.0,The PUMA brand it’s incomplete it just come UMA without the P
3.0,"not what I expected, sent back"
3.0,"After two years of having this wallet, it is basically ripping apart. I might buy another wallet, but not from this brand."
3.0,"The shirt is pretty but it’s the stretchy, cold, slick feeling material, it just clings to me, yuk! I like cotton blends that flow, not just cling to my body. Now this shirt would look great on a trim body but I’m overweight, it’s not flattering on me."
3.0,Shipping takes a while and it has an awful smell but it's cute!
3.0,"This is a beautiful, long dress, pretty colors, BUT mine already has a rip on the seam at the bottom left side of the dress; it took TOO long to arrive...didn't know that it was coming from CHINA; no belt loops; no return slip in the package, no receipt!! I wore the dress with electric blue sandals and a beautiful yellow necklace! The dress would be perfect for a vacation, date night, or special event but the makers of this dress need to do better with making clothes! I have to sew the ripped part of the dress up before it rips apart even worse!! I think that it'll be best to hand-wash this dress instead of machine washing it....I'm afraid that it will come apart in the washing machine!!"
3.0,I think you need a specifix body shape for this and mines not having it fit in the chest area! The materials gold string bottoms are cheap looking.
3.0,The band is very tight and even with it being tight the bonnet slipped off during the night.
3.0,the material it's made out of is that weird stuff that gets a bunch of tiny lint balls over time. I ordered a XXL cuz I wanted it to be baggy and it came in medium :/ but other than that it's pretty good
3.0,I has dark dingy spots on it.
3.0,"I love the pins, but it is hard to see the name under. Also I did not receive the pin that reads Nah -Rosa Parks"
3.0,I love the shirt however the stencil is missed up on the ears.  I chatted with assistant and was told they been having issues with that item. So no since in trying to get a replacement.  So i will have to return which isn't easy i don't have a printer to print a label.  So first I'm going to have to find somewhere to do that. Which leads to next problem the biggest city close to me that i can get this done is 45 miles away.
3.0,It's not as thick as they make it look
3.0,"I followed their measurement guide and ordered the XL. My waist is 29"" and even though I could put it on,  the waistband was pulling enough that it looked like the top button would pop.  The length is nice.  It hit mid calf and I'm 5'8"". The red color is beautiful. I wish it had a lining underneath but I don't have a problem wearing a slip.  I like that the buttons are real. I would've kept it if it had fit right around my waist."
3.0,"Both me and my teenage son got a pair of these.  Love them for the versatility to quickly getting in and out of the bindings.  One bad feature and it is a big one.  There is at least 4-5mm of vertical play/laxity in the rear locking mechanism on all four of our boot-binding interfaces.  What this translates to is the heel lifting this 4-5mm with each switch from heal-side to toe-side.  Makes you feel like there is a lot of laxity between the foot and the board.  Also, there is a lot of creaking on the front locking interfaces....loud bindings."
3.0,"This leotard fits as expected, but the overall quality is not that great. It's pretty, but the fabric is very slippery and shiny, and it feels pretty cheaply made. For the price, it is great, but if you are looking for a long lasting, comfortable leotard, this isn't it..."
3.0,I loved the dress but it was a little small around the bust I need to order it a size bigger
3.0,Disappointed because these glasses were not shipped in a box so of course they got bent and don't fit right.
3.0,"Deconstructed, distressed, loose fit shirt/jacket. The frayed hem is a bit to much. The material and color are nice, the silver buttons are a perfect accent.  This is a good layer to toss in a bag for a camping trip or day at the beach it's a bit longer, super casual and the loose fit makes it an easy layer over a t-shirt or sweater. Easy to pack casual look. Good value for the price."
3.0,"Cute pearl dangling , however I worry that with no latch on the earrings, it's easy to accidentally knock it out. In addition, the prong or hook on the metal is a tad too thick and uncomfortably stretches my ear piercing."
3.0,"Well, 2-3 gems fell off and a part of the chain broke. I gave it 3 stars because it is a very pretty necklace and an easy fix. Requires super glue, patience, a good eye and a steady hand. Although, I haven't gotten around to it and I understand that I shouldn't expect perfection for the price, it just would have been a lovely surprise to have received my purchase intact."
3.0,"This shirt was clingy across the stomach area-the area I need to hide. Also, the sleeves were way too long. I normally wear a medium and ordered a medium."
3.0,Very disappointed 9 year old son because sunglasses did not come with the case pictured.  Sunglasses are nice and fit him perfectly but only showed with a cheap cardboard box and no case.
3.0,"outfit was cute but the shirt was way too big. she usually wears a size 18 months in a onsie, but this one fit like it was a 2 toddler, the skirt fit fine."
3.0,The color is great<br />The style is great<br />The dress is too short
3.0,I love this bag but was disappointed that the zipper broke after just a few uses. If it wasn't for that I'd carry it all the time. I like it enough to try fixing it myself eventually.
3.0,These are tiny!  More of a girls glove than a women’s glove.
3.0,I liked it at first a very pretty watch. Within a week it started changing colors the face turned off white and the band is turning black.
3.0,"I love the aesthetic of these earrings as well as being able to hang them at different lengths. The agate looks really great...... Quite unfortunately though, they won’t stay in my ears!!! They’re at their worst when I’ve only threaded them through one hole in each line. As I do have multiple piercings on each lobe, I’ve begun to thread them through at least two holes. However, the thing chain threader then tightens around one or more love and yet still.... eventually they come undone. Now I *have* tried several different backs to see if I could make them stay that way. I tried the regular backing as well as those with a disc around them and EVEN the clear tubes sometimes used. I really thought the latter would be solution! However, even with the largest set of clear plastic cuff backings I could fine, I had to truly struggle to attempt to get them onto the threaders and I figured even if I didn’t bring the backing up to the back of my lobe.... surely this would be my solve for the day..... nope, entire thing still slipped through my ear and I lost one because though I had caught each separate earrings several times.... at some point I didn’t feel one come out and so now I’m left with one."
3.0,"The shorts are odd. There is no front or back which I’m not a fan of, because they then look odd. But otherwise cute!"
3.0,"Very tiny birds,  Much smaller then expected."
3.0,Tried to wear as a fun maternity dress. Thin material and the front slit was too short for me (I’m 5’9” for reference but also 6 months pregnant).
3.0,Great looking chill but that's about it definitely run too small make sure you size up
3.0,Very pretty but larger than expected. Items get lost and opening is small. Sending back two purses.
3.0,The clasp part always finds it way in front!!
3.0,The material is bad
3.0,It was too big for my wrist and I’m still trying to figure out how to adjust it.
3.0,"The fit was perfect, I'm 5'4 and 150lbs, I ordered a large. The fabric however is not what I expected. It's more of a shiny Halloween costume type material. It ends up making you look more like a referee at a kids soccer match or a damn Footlocker employee! I would stay away from there black and white stripe dress. Try one of the other color options maybe. The dress itself would've been one of my favorites if it wasn't for the fabric.<br /><br />PS maybe it's just me, but the horizontal stripes on the chest DO NOT do any favors for large breasted women with this dress."
3.0,Quality wasn't as good as we thought.
3.0,"I got these bracelets for my mom, sister, and myself so we would always have something to represent our love for one another since my mom has cancer again and it is stage 4 this time. I wanted to be able to wear this all the time 24/7, that's why I got these because they are supposed to be hypoallergenic, however, when I wore it for 2 days straight, I realized I had a rash growing on my arm. As soon as I took it off, I realized the rash disappeared. They are absolutely beautiful, but it isn't sterling silver or hypoallergenic like it says. This isn't for those with sensitive skin like myself. You need to go sterling silver or real gold. I had to buy different ones for us, but my mom think those are beautiful too. I'm just out some money since I can't wear this and I haven't seen them wear it either."
3.0,I was really expecting the pictured suit! Yet i was disappointed when i got a suit with a completely different pattern.
3.0,the rubber between the jewels stretches and tends to pinch<br />very pretty
3.0,"I was so excited to get this bracelet.But when I opened package I was disappointed.The bracelet is large for my wrist,but I have small wrist,so it's okay.On the pictures agate looks shiny,but in reality it's dull :("
3.0,Runs small. Wish  I would order a Medium size.
3.0,"It would be great except shoulders are snug even at extra large. Usually this style would be loose at large or just right at medium. I ordered extra large, after I read several reviews. I love the style. Comfortable otherwise."
3.0,"I really love the size of these nose rings.  The quality seems pretty good for the price.  It has been great to try out different colors and test the size.The rose gold is my favorite.  I like the 2mm flat top, as it is enough to see, but still subtle.  The downside is the bend that goes in your nose is very small so it keeps falling out.  I have already lost two in a few weeks. If you are want to test out colors and see if you like the size these are great for the price, but not a good long term solution in my opinion."
3.0,"Did not like the length and it ran a little large.  Ordered a small and could have gone to an x-small (5'1"" and 114lbs)<br />Gave me a ""frumpy"" look."
3.0,These are super cute with adjustable straps but run very big.
3.0,Cute socks. Nice and thick. Keeps your feet feeling cozy and warm. The problem I have with these socks is that I have naturally wide ankles and feet. These socks are not really meant for people like me. I’m surprised i was able to fit them on! It takes patience and work to slide these on but once they’re on they like walking on clouds. Make the material more elastic/stretchy and they’ll be perfect.
3.0,I ordered mine and it's to big in some places and fits well in  others. I'm on the fence with this
3.0,Ordered it twice. And received the wrong size both times.
3.0,Order 1. Size larger
3.0,"All the reviews and even the description point out how small this runs because it is sold in Asian sizing and warn you to buy it much larger than your usual size.  So although I wear 8 or 10P pants, I ordered an XL.  (I don’t like overly tight bathing suit bottoms that ride up.)  Too big!  It’s a nice bathing suit and seems of reasonable quality… but you don’t have to get crazy about going up two sizes as some of the reviews suggest.  One should do."
3.0,I bought this expecting a dress but it's more of a tunic. Very short on me and I'm 5'7'' and got a small.
3.0,Too long and skinny. I bought a 3x and and its maybe a large.
3.0,"It's great if you want a very thin, light raincoat. I need a heavier one. This one also folds up really small for camping or travel but I don't need that."
3.0,the sleeves are a little odd they have a sewn part about midway from the elbow to the wrist that is off putting.
3.0,"I thought I was going to like this dress.  I got the black print maxi dress.  I'm 5'2"" so it was dragging on the floor.  I could've easily worn platform tall sandals, or hemmed it with fabric tape, but I didn't like the fabric.  It had no give/stretch and it just felt like my sweat would definitely stick to the fabric.  Not a very comfy forgiving fabric.  Also the top part didn't look the same as the pic.  But if this was made with a rayon blend or even cotton, I would've definitely kept it."
3.0,These are cute n perfectly distressed but the high waist is incredibly too baggy so I had to take it in a little the rest fit fine
3.0,"I bought the cap as a gift. The cap design is a great idea. The cap material is not so great, very flimsy and thin. Based on the pricing, you would expect that cap would be made of better material. I think the price is not justified for the quality."
3.0,These are really cute however they don't last and do break.  I guess the price reflects the quality.
3.0,"Though it is well made, the color of the gold ( over stainless steel )  is strange. It has a slight green cast to it and is not a great look."
3.0,"It is a thin material.  Where it was cut is uneven.  But the length is perfect.  I would return it, but it is an ok basic."
3.0,It's a whistle. Just a whistle. For less than a dollar on amzreviewtrader.com!
3.0,I haven't worn it yet. The fit is fine but the detail is cheap. Guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Decided it’s so cheap and it doesn’t hold coins in it. The coins they sell with it. They’re useless and they’re not even sturdy at all. Just a cheap thing laying around. I threw in the garbage.
3.0,"I purchased this dress to wear to my sister's wedding as I am a nursing mother.  It was WAY too tight and I order a couple of sizes up from what I normally wear.  The dress was lovely and very pretty, but I had to return it because it didn't fit."
3.0,The quality does not justify the price..i did not like the feel and the quality. It looks beautiful when u wear it but overpriced
3.0,Bought this dress on sale and expected it to be more fitting at the top. This would be a lot cuter if I had a larger chest but I don’t. Trying to hem the top somehow so that it doesn’t look as weird on the top. The quality is pretty decent though.
3.0,fell apart after one week
3.0,Fits kinda small.
3.0,Okay glasses just much shinier in person.<br />Not gonna work for my cosplay.
3.0,not what i needed
3.0,"i love this swimsuit, it fit perfectly im giving 3 stars because the starp in the back was missing.. :/"
3.0,"My son LOVED this. Gave it to him for his birthday. A week later, the chain snapped. He was devastated."
3.0,Cut VERY small. Not soft material not stretchy
3.0,"Mask was very large and loose. Fortunately I used this as a cover overtop of my other mask, for a costume.<br />The design is also quite flat, picture makes it look like a metallic/foil print."
3.0,"Stitching not as quality as Twins, Top King, etc.... Waistband is larger than all my other shorts. Hayabusa shorts are on the bottom"
3.0,"They look great. Not too tight on my legs. They ride up until you get sweaty enough to keep them in place, which is kind of annoying. Def not thick enough to cover any cellulite you’re trying to hide, but otherwise I dig them."
3.0,Nice dress. For my daughter but too small.
3.0,Good idea but hard to get kids to keep on their face to cover nose/mouth
3.0,It's what I wanted mostly. It is very nice and I'm excited to wear it.
3.0,me gustaría la tela un poco más gruesa es demasiado delgada
3.0,"In my experience 2xist products tend to run small. This is not the case with these. I ordered a large, as I normally would, but was disappointed to find that I should have ordered a medium. The materials, color, and construction are great."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, but the fabric is too thin. It's nearly see through. I would highly recommend a slip. To big for me, but still a somewhat nice dress."
3.0,Too tight! I ordered them in small. Very difficult to put them on.
3.0,"It a cute 60 degrees  jacket, but I have to hand wash it becausethe liner  it came with a crazy smell that I can not  describe."
3.0,"I bought this from Marshall’s for my son. He wears 24 months. Clothes are true to size. I bought the light grey set with the little lime green details. I adore it, but like I said about another Reebok set of ours, the pilling is a little extreme. I wish they stayed nicer longer."
3.0,Too large for my husband
3.0,So I took out a cpl links because it came way too big. Then it was too small so I added a link and it was too big. No happy medium. But the case is awesome. Love the bling.
3.0,"I am and extra small size normally, but per other reviewers, bought a small.  The top fit perfectly, but the bottom is smaller than an extra small....  Fortunately the fabric doesn't shrink, because if the bottoms got any smaller it would be impossible to wear them.  As it is, the bottoms disappoint, because they are too uncomfortable to sleep in.  However, the top is very nice; nice enough that I could see wearing it with a pair of jeans in a casual sort of way.  So, this is a mixed review.  Really wish I could get a medium in the bottoms...."
3.0,"The bags looks did not disappoint, beautiful print and colors and seems durable so far.  Reason for 3 stars is there is absolutely no structure to this bag.  In teh picture it appears it’s standing straight up but in reality it folds on itself.  So much that most items put in the inner pockets falls out to the bottom of the bag because of the flimsiness.  Nice enough for the price but I’m still looking for a good travel bag to hook to my carry on roller."
3.0,Am returning the item
3.0,Cheap material and way to small
3.0,"I purchased these for my elderly father after he had a stroke and has trouble with balance and walking properly. The socks are very thin and his main complaint was that he can feel the grippers on the bottom of his feet which gave him the feeling of "" walking barefoot on gravel"" he only wears them to bed as it's not comfortable in his shoes. He also suffers from diabetes and neuropathy so his legs swell which is another reason these are the only type of socks he can wear but even when his ankles are swollen the socks slide down on him. Didn't find a use for the pads that come with them so we just tossed them in the trash. Overall I don't think I will be purchasing again I will stick with the original ones I have bought him before. More thicker and longer on the legs."
3.0,Have ordered this type of legging before on Amazon but these did not meet my expectations. They ran small and the material had little to no give. I wear a large. I passed them on to my granddaughter who wears a small and they were perfect for her.
3.0,Ok but looks fake.  Missing the extender.  Returned it.
3.0,"3.5 Stars<br /><br /> I am 5'3 and wear a 10/12 and between M/L and got this in a L. I wanted to love this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />I love the feel. It is so soft on the outside and inside! It is warm but still breathable. I love the black and white buffalo check!<br /><br />CONS:<br />The pocket placement is weird. It is literally on the side seam of the sweater. It is awkward to actually use for your hands. Also, because of the placeme t of that the sweater shape seems to get boxy and poof out on the pockets. It does not leave a flattering shape! I dont know if I had sized down if it would sit better.<br /><br />I will probably wear this around the house as it is so comfy and cute but I am pretty sad about the shape."
3.0,These don't show when I wear them with ballet flats. They do when I wear them with low cut heels. They also slip. Better than others I have tried but I wish there was something better out there.
3.0,"These pants are more ostentatious than I originally thought... really &#34;loud&#34; colors, also there is NO reinforcement in the waste area so they constantly slip down. In the image, it appears that it goes in at the waste a little which may imply reinforcing elastic, but don't be fooled, it the same material as the rest of the pant so it's too weak to hold up the weight of the pant."
3.0,"Fits as I would expect as far as size, but the neckline was weird and the fabric didn’t seem to sit right like most crew neck sweaters. It served its purpose, but next time I would probably pass."
3.0,They are small I just gave them to my son
3.0,"These run a bit long. I'm 5'4&#34; and the Large was entirely too long for me. I suspect a small would perhaps have been the right length, but that's never going to happen :)"
3.0,"My hubby had me return this because there wasn't enough pockets.  Also, he was afraid the ID insert would get separated and lost."
3.0,Looks just like picture but the zippers are not the best they constantly are getting stuck and jammed but it was a great looking product but again zippers can def be better
3.0,Extremely short if you butt is big 30th bday 2.22
3.0,"Not for short people. Socks went quite higher than expected, ( my nightie was longer that the top of the socks...and it's a short one) and the thigh part was tighter than what was comfortable."
3.0,Biggest problem was the material was defective as a thread started coming loose after wearing only once and you could see the fabric begin to start unravelling? I sent it back and am awaiting a replacement so hopefuly it was just a one off defect as I know these guys make quality garments I have had before.
3.0,Everything looked exactly like the picture but was a lot larger then expected.
3.0,"I like the way it looks overall, but I'm not crazy about the material. It's just a little too 'processed/unnatural' feeling for my taste. I usually stick with natural fibers. Also, it was obviously 'tried on' by someone before me who left a 'perfumy' smell to the garment. - JW"
3.0,"I love everything about this shirt EXCEPT it makes me sweat like a draft horse.  So do not wear it when you expect to walk around San Francisco like I did, as I was dripping by the time I arrived at Club Fugazi on a jaunt from Fisherman's Wharf( 40 minutes.)  Otherwise, it is fashionable, and very groovy."
3.0,Very sheer!
3.0,"I like the way they fit,  just too short.  I'm 5""7' and usually get tall. Comfy though"
3.0,I love these jeans except it didn't state that the thigh area  is lighter in color. Being older not into worn look.
3.0,sigh ... I think these pants run large. They’re super cute and warm.
3.0,A little flimsy and sharp...hurts to put on and off.
3.0,The brushes are tiny should  have been bigger.
3.0,"Not super comfortable. Almost feels like a compression tee. If you normally wear medium, get large. If you wear large, get XL, etc..."
3.0,"Not sure of it was just me, but these bracelets felt a tad rough.  A couple of the extender chains broke off broke off as I was adding charms to the main link.  It was ok but I would not repurchase."
3.0,"doesn't stay tight, have to adjust all the time while wearing other then that, great"
3.0,It does the trick. Pair with an elastic belly band to keep your pants up and hide your zipper. Kept me out of maternity jeans.
3.0,I received a product that was similar but not right. Instead of a white stripe it’s black.  I don’t like the black stripe.  Hope the operations can be fixed for what they ship. the fit is good though.
3.0,"I ordered and received four pair of reading glasses. However, one of the pair of glasses had the left temple ear piece snapped off it upon receipt. The other three pair seem to be fine and meet my expectations."
3.0,This is not really a &#34;wrap&#34; -- it's more of a straight skirt than a cute A- line. the top does have the long straps so you can make it look like a wrap. I like the color and think it will wear well.
3.0,"cute, but is a lot smaller than it looks"
3.0,"This shirt is really cute. I like the colors, they are perfect for the fall months. It looks good with a pair of jeans. I am 125 LBS, 5’1, and have a 34C bust. The small fit me well. The material of the shirt itself is thin though and feels scratchy against the skin. Overall it is an okay shirt,  I wish that it was made of better quality material."
3.0,"My son wanted the Dauntless emblem on a necklace.  Since he was paying with his own money, he got this inexpensive one.  It was what I expected for the price.  The pendant itself is a lightweight and feels inexpensive."
3.0,"Cute design but looked awful on me. Fabric thin and really clingy and unforgiving. For reference, I'm 5'4&#34; 160lbs, medium small bust (38), short waist (30-31) and wider hips (44)"
3.0,"Okay so I didn't keep this swimsuit for a couple reasons.<br />1. The torso is super long. I'm 5' 6&#34; with almost exactly the same length of torso as legs. There was waaay too much torso in this bathing suit.<br />2. If you have even a little tummy, don't do it. This doesn't hide bumps and bulges the way normal ruching does.<br />3. The cups on this are... odd. There is a weird stiffness to them and even though I'm a C cup they were too big.<br /><br />But, the quality on the fabric was really nice and so was the design. So maybe if you are taller with larger breasts this would work for you."
3.0,"Packing was very bad, it was looking like sent an returned item. Size and fit ok"
3.0,"First order I placed was for 15 mm, the were much smaller than I was expecting. Returned the order with a free shipping label, printed off line and got the 24mm. Much happier with the sixe. Very pretty diamond cut hoops."
3.0,"Fabric is cheap, however the colors looked great and it was flattering. I wore it outside during a hot day mid summer and I was fine. I wish the fabric was better quality."
3.0,I really like this dress but unfortunately I do not have the body for it. Dress was loose under the arms and way too form fitting in the stomach area. It’s cute. Wish it fit but not for me.
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings but the stems are so long that even with the backing screwed on as far as it can go, earrings sagged in the front."
3.0,A little shear and bigger in the top.  Very light can easily dress up or make casual.  Good price. Fast shipping .
3.0,"I adore this dress. However, this would work well for a smaller chested woman. It has zero support and when you lean over your girls fall out. Wearing a strapless bra shows terribly so using nipple covers helps. I’ll probably try to sew in pads or order the backless deep-v bra. Also the string it comes with is stiff and cheap. Easily replaced with quality string from a fabric store. Perfect summer dress. I’m 5’5”, 120lbs and the M fit perfect."
3.0,It was beautiful like the picture! Just runs really really small so I ordered another
3.0,"The fit was different! Top was way to big, 38d and bottoms were tight. But worn and looked cute even oversize top."
3.0,Dress is nicely made and super soft however it runs large
3.0,Not too waterproof. Expect wet feet if your kiddo steps in a puddle
3.0,One review I read said the backs don’t stay up or are nonexistent. Should have listened to that. My grandson loves the idea but can’t keep them on his feet.
3.0,"These are long and heavy. The string knot is rather visible between each pearl. They looked OK, but really not what I thought they would be like. Returned them to look for something else."
3.0,Dresses up a black dress or top.
3.0,"Es muy lindo, pero la talla corre muy chica.."
3.0,no really good quality shirt
3.0,"The sizes are on the small size.  I easily fit a large in regular boxes, but these are more snug than I would want from &#34;comfortable&#34; shorts.  The fabric is nice though."
3.0,"It's cute but if you can normally wear a medium I would go with the large in these, the shorts are pretty small. The top fits like one of this men's work out tanks but it's soft and comfy."
3.0,"I really did love this, but it didn't last long before it started to turn color. It's really dark and discolored now, but it was beautiful before it turned color."
3.0,Not very easy to zip plus there are two zippers. I do like the long length.
3.0,"The sleepshirt is very nice but this 3 stars may let them change their expensive prices,  I bought rampage sleepshirts it's triple cheaper than hatley and better cotton material"
3.0,Cute but really long shipping time.
3.0,"Sent for a LG, was tight for my husband,  sent them back for an X large and then they sent me a large  again so I sent back and didn't get them"
3.0,"Runs big. I bought it to wear with leggings but due to how large it is, I now wear it as a night gown."
3.0,Brought for a friends Bday gift she loves butterflies as well.  After I gave the crystal accents started to fall out
3.0,Loose threads were evident.
3.0,Sturdy and quality is good but it is large and bulky and not sure I will wear it that much because of that.
3.0,These are very cute sandals but are very narrow I wish we had gotten a size bigger as I struggle to put my 4yr old’s foot into these so she has only wore them a few times and her dad had to be the one to put them on because I can’t even get them on her. But very cute and great price just maybe get a size larger than your kid wears.
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and 155-160 pounds and I ordered Medium size, and Medium works for me most of the time.  It fits a little tighter on me than on the model, especially the arms.  I'd prefer a little more looseness around the bust so that it would not be so form fitting.<br /><br />I'll still wear it and see how it works for me. If I'm OK with the fabric and quality I'm open to ordering another but in a larger size.  The wine color is very nice and is good on me.  (If you've ever had your &#34;colors done&#34;, I'm a summer and this is great.)"
3.0,"Very tight on the 20mm, workable and good price."
3.0,Picture doesn't represent product.  Glad I didn't pay anymore than  did.
3.0,"Positives: the socks are lightweight, comfortable, and really nice just to wear around the house."
3.0,Not what I had expected the legs are long but the crotch area doesn't match the with the bottom
3.0,"bigger opening than I'd like, they are cute though"
3.0,"I really like the look of these and got compliments on the stones and even the style of the adjustable strings. Unfortunately, these bracelets don't last. I bought one and took it off every time I was in the shower or went swimming, to try to keep the string dry - it broke after about two months, and I reasoned that the stress of taking it on and off (loosening the string and tightening the string) was what caused it to break.<br /><br />I bought another with the idea that I would just keep it on in the water, but the string broke after a month.<br /><br />I don't know if it's cheap string, but after two bracelets in three months, I'm not buying another. Even though they look nice."
3.0,Very tight fit . I should have ordered 1 size bigger than normal . Inner soles are a little rough .
3.0,"1 chain (of 3 I ordered) arrived with a broken clasp. The other 2 seem like decent quality although none of the jump rings that attach the clasp are soldered, so if the chain was pulled on hard enough, they would easily open up and you'd lose the necklace. Decent for the price but looks like quality control is hit or miss."
3.0,A great mask and love the look but the mask wire broke on me
3.0,The sizing was awful. Too narrow at the bottom without a slit.  Maybe sized for juniors.  The fabric and design were nice.
3.0,Product did not meet my expectations from the picture
3.0,The shoes that I received with this outfit have different leapard print than the rest of the outfit and does not match.
3.0,Product looked good.  I ordered a L but recd a S. Returned.
3.0,Ring is very thick and does not fit one side of my GTI key
3.0,"Thin, see thru"
3.0,Kinda odd with the long string to tie. It’s very thin material and it faded after one wash.
3.0,The quality of these glasses are great but they run a little small
3.0,"Not as long as it appears to be in photo. Good quality, just shorter than expected and is why i wanted it"
3.0,THIS WERE GIVEN AS A GIFT TO MY NEICE AND SHE JUST LOVES THEM.<br />SHE WERES THEM ALL THE TIME TIME
3.0,"Pretty color, but too big"
3.0,I received a lot of them. Some colors were not in the proper order and it breaks VERY easily.
3.0,"Compared to my TraderJoe’s apron it’s small. I’m may be tall, but not big. Not generous enough"
3.0,"I night this shirt to be able to wear it to work but unfortunately the plunge is so low and revealing I don't think it would be appropriate if I didn't talk about how low the v in the shirt really is. The shirt material is super soft and really stretchy. It fits perfectly besides the V.  For reference I'm 5'2, 128lbs and a 38DDD."
3.0,The description said this will come with a mask but it did not.  Cute wings though and great quality.  My grands will love this addition to their dress-up trunk.
3.0,they’re super cute and most are adjustable but they do turn your fingers green… soooo i don’t wear them as often but still pretty.
3.0,Weight of fabric too thin as a dress.  Slip is needed.  Hem is an inch below knees.
3.0,It hurts the area around the toes.
3.0,"I LOVED the top, I wish I could have returned just the bottoms for a bigger size and kept the top. But since it’s a set I wasn’t sure I could do that. The bottoms were smaller than I expected. They fit very weird, the front and the back looked the same when they aren’t being worn. So the back has no room for your booty, causing them to ride up in the back and leave you with a lot of room in the front. I didn’t care for the booty shorts, I prefer mine loose. So if that’s something that doesn’t bother you, then go for it 👍🏼 They are advertised in the photos as being a looser fit, so maybe I just needed to size up altogether. I ordered a small and I run true to that size in most cases."
3.0,ok but the button to hold the back hat was missing
3.0,The fabric was a little thinner than expected but they fit my granddaughter fine. She liked the graphic on the front.
3.0,This is made of almost a term cloth inside which is weird. Not really a er skirt and I cold never wear it in the winter as it would’ve way to cold. Bizarre.
3.0,Product worked very well but the sizing was a bit off
3.0,"I like these shorts, but they're a bit snug around the butt and the thigh.  Also, the fabric is stretchy -- something I'm not accustomed to with men's clothing.  The color is nice, however, and the price was right."
3.0,This Dress did not fit and I didn't return it on time so I'm stuck with a very lovely gown that too small to wear. 🥺🥺
3.0,Color not blue for sure but is a moon stone
3.0,"Unfortunately the handle just broke on one side, and I loss the wristlet in a store. Lucky I called right away. Need to fix it or I wish they could send me a new one."
3.0,I particularly loved this design. When I received it I was pleasantly  surprised. Looks beautiful.
3.0,Pretty bathing suit. Unfortunately the bottoms are slightly too big on me so I have just worn the top. It’s cute but not the most flattering. Colors are beautiful though. For reference I wear a size 7 (medium) and 36DD.
3.0,Easily falls apart
3.0,Doesn’t match picture.<br />The mane is not as full as the picture and the horn is a dark brown and over stuffed making it look like a turd coming out from in-between the non proportional ears.
3.0,"Brief are okay, but there is no peak hole. They're mens size but are designed like boys breifs. Also they ride up and give grundies."
3.0,The belt is very small for for robe.  For the price it is ok however order at least one size up and dont expect too much
3.0,It's definitely a good deal for the price. It does fit a bit strangely because it's a structured neckline and it feels a little odd. But overall well worth the price.
3.0,"The fabric is a bit thin, but after a couple of washes it has not ""pilled."""
3.0,Cute but a lot smaller then I expected
3.0,fit a bit small
3.0,Nice fabric. Comfy. But more fitted and clingy than I wanted it to be.  Definitely don't get this if you have any areas below the waist you don't love and want to show off.
3.0,"They are OK, nothing spectacular about it...they are leather, but a opaque.. a"
3.0,Probably my own fault but they are almost $14 for a single pair and they aren't cotton feeling at all they feel more like the mesh atheltic kind. Other then that no real complaints
3.0,Nice material just a little small.
3.0,looks nice but unable to move on it
3.0,Looks close enough to my speedy 25 but color is a little off when you look closely. The red is darker on the original bag and stitching too. Its a good strap that gets the job done but I honestly I think it’s overpriced. Just my opinion.
3.0,"It was cute, only got one good wear out of it before the top started giving problems (it started to stretch out)."
3.0,Pros: Helmet is decent quality. Color and shape are good.<br />Cons: Helmet runs small for an average adult. Visor will need some sort of additional tint if you prefer your face not to be seen.
3.0,This necklace is just ok and I don't think I will wear it.
3.0,"The watch strap is very transparent. I ordered this because on the pics you can see beautiful turqoise color, but the product is very far from that because of transparency."
3.0,Gorgeous ring! I was really happy with this! I bought it to use as my wedding ring/band when I was at work. (Clean houses)...I wore it 2 days....not even a total of 8 hours. My finger has turned a lovely grey/greenish tint...
3.0,Build quality is very good however it is thick but overall good.
3.0,"It is really cute, but there was a pattern error at the seam near the naval.  You could see a black line on the fabric, it looked like it was marking where the fabric was supposed to be sewn."
3.0,"Great idea, but the execution leaves something to be desired.  The ratchet functions seems to work great, however the release catch is very stiff.  Not sure if it's just on the one I received or the same across all.  Also, there are no clear instruction for how to cut the belt to size.  We figured you should be able to use a utility knife or something that an average household would have available, however we were not able to achieve a clean or straight cut with a utility knife.  We ended up using a power saw to get a good straight cut.  Then, still had to use a utility knife to trim the frayed edge to look nice and flat, and so it would fit into the buckle well.  Because of this, the belt ended up being a little shorter than we would have liked."
3.0,the band on top was too tight for me
3.0,"This is abit strange, maybe because I’m just 5.3""<br />But it was somewhat tight around the very high waist and huge everywhere else. The pants are very long on me, and I stumble in them if I don’t wear high heel’s, so I think I might alter them.<br />I’m still keeping them. The fabric feels good and light, and perfect for summer."
3.0,"These are nice light weight hiking boots. They aren’t for serious hikes but would be great for light hikes and walks. They look good! Now, for the bad part, they run small. I have NEVER bought a size 8 (even in my other Sorel boots). I won’t send them back but I will use a boot stretcher so they work for me."
3.0,Was a little off centered
3.0,I have used these twice in the pool and they are already starting to come apart.
3.0,Both look pretty great so far. The only issue is the horseshoe is to tight to flip up which is why i needed it. I may be able to widen it though. Not too bad for the price though.
3.0,It was a bit tight in my head and not as baggy looking. Ended up giving it to my 5 yr old. Fit her  much getter.
3.0,"La foto es muy mala,pero la tela es suave"
3.0,Not comfortable over glasses and our glasses are tiny
3.0,Love the robe didn’t receive the tie to robe would of given a 5 star
3.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable.  The grey t-shirt material is thin and soft and the most comfortable jersey.  The white pom poms lining it give it a fun edge and pretty Summery vibe.  The cut of it, however, is very small.  As stated in the title, I'm a size 8, and even a size large was a very short mini that barely covered my butt, too much space in the chest area, and an overall tightness around my hips.  Maybe for a swimsuit cover-up this would work, but I can't wear it as a dress."
3.0,They were too big for me.
3.0,"The white plastic clasp on the bands is very sharp and irritating to my sons arm. I put a band aid under it anyway because we were going to an amusement park and I really wanted the extra security of an air tag since he is known to slip off... Well, at some point the clasp let go and we lost the air tag because it appeared as if someone had picked it up and I couldn't spend the whole day chasing a $30 airtag around six flags. Aside from the clasp and the loss the band seemed very well made. I loved the yellow color most and the quality of the rubber wrist band seemed very well and didn't irritate my son at all. If the clasp/button thingy was improved Id feel good about recommending this but as is I cannot recommend buying it.... Especially for kids."
3.0,Beautiful piece.  Only reason I'm not giving it four stars is that is tarnishes after wearing it a while.  I read where it helps to put clear nail polish on it so it shines again.  Why doesn't the manufacturer to that?
3.0,"I received my Norwegian flag gaiter today. The quality of the material is fantastic. The craftsmanship is top-notch. I love the draw string option. The problem is...the Norwegian flag is definitely NOT orange. The flag is supposed to be red, but instead is a very vibrant orange. I’m more than a little disappointed."
3.0,"Stiff, weird odor"
3.0,It was ok but it could have fit better.
3.0,"It does not look as good as it does in the photo.  Also,  it only looks good on one side."
3.0,Nice but I wNted the larger size 22 can I return it
3.0,I ordered a size 10 and found the armholes were cut too large. I have a standard sized chest (c cup) which should have appropriately filled out the blouse.  Unfortunately the large cut of the armholes on this blouse created gaps of excess material sticking out under each arm and this made my bra very visable.  Dissappointing! Otherwise the shirt is very cute and well made.
3.0,"The sizing is way off.  The size in (parentheses) have nothing to do with the actual size. The Medium is actually 22 inches, NOT 28. It’s not even 28 inches fully stretched.  It’s a nice belt, seems well made, but here I am with less than a week before school starts having to reorder a larger size because someone at this company doesn’t know how to read a measuring tape."
3.0,Interesting. Thought it would be a little heavier.
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture. I was expecting more of a swoop neck but it just looks like a plane 'ol turtle neck
3.0,"Purchased these sunglasses because they are not oversized and would fit a small face like mine. They are a good fit for smaller faces, but unfortunately I did not like the style on myself, so I'll be returning them. Otherwise they are a very decent pair for the price. The polarized lenses did work very well in the sun! Not too dark at all. I even tried removing the little nose pieces for a better fit on my face and still they just didn't look right on me : (<br />Too round for my liking and it's too bad because the company even offers a warranty for the product which would've been good to have."
3.0,I ordered a XL and it fits like a 3X. So I need a medium or small
3.0,"This bra is super cute, but it is pretty low quality and has basically no support. It was inconvenient that it only comes in two sizes. I am 32C and would get a medium in most sports bras, but sometimes a small. Based on reviews, it sounded like the smaller size might be too small, so I got the M/L. Maybe the smaller size would have been a little better. It is much looser than I'd have liked. It fits ok and looks cute with an open back shirt, but I definitely cannot wear it to work out."
3.0,Oh man. The color is lighter and not vibrant at all. I Hate the stretchy fabric. I saw the 5% spandex and knew it would have some give to it but it feels like tights.<br /><br />They must have changed the shirt since other reviews because this thing is massive. Definitely not a woman fit. The XL is almost exactly the same size as my Men's Large graphic tees. I put two different Women's XL from two completely different places on top to show the difference. The arms and neck are way bigger and it is also several inches wider.<br /><br />I will probably return or regift. Bummer.
3.0,order couple sizes larger for it to fit
3.0,I’m going to take off the broken piece of metal across the front. I think it will be fine but it was disappointing that it was broken.
3.0,Love it but sizes run at least a size smaller than your regular size and will shrink in dryer.
3.0,Difficult clasp but cute.
3.0,Smaller than thought.  Not bad for the price
3.0,It shows to hold a lot of cards but if once in there then the wallet will not snap shut.
3.0,This item fitted too large on me. But overall it was a very pretty color and style dress.
3.0,Tooooo small fit. Ordered XL-fit like Medium
3.0,"The boots are adorable, however one of the buttons fell off the first day my daughter wore the boots."
3.0,I love them but the velvet rubs off leaving ugly spots
3.0,"This is super cute, but runs extremely small. Looks like Capri pants."
3.0,"It was just too long for me, by about four inches. I'm 5'2&#34; and 110lbs. The material was a little thinner than I prefer, but I probably would have kept it if the length had worked. They were accommodating about returning though. Appreciated that!"
3.0,The thickness was very cheap.
3.0,I bought to see how I look and if looks good I was gonna get the real one but damn this hurts lol. I think its cute but I only had it on for like 20mins and it was painful.
3.0,It's cute but very very tiny.
3.0,I feel like the top is faded.  Looks nice online but def not what I expected
3.0,"When I saw the reviews saying this had a really tight waistband, I was excited - I've got wide hips and a narrow waist, and usually have to deal with a gaping waistband on everything. I'm 5'5"" and 130lbs, and ordered a medium.  The waistband was nice and tight, but everything else was pretty baggy.  Fine for PJs, but not so great for wearing out and about.  Also, the fabric is much more of a thin legging material, not the thick sweatpant material you usually get with joggers."
3.0,They have a lot of extra room in the crotch and I should have sized down
3.0,Son muy  confortable y cómoda me siento bien con la compra
3.0,"Although super cute, the pockets ripped after first wear. Very disappointed as I loved the idea of having pockets. Tummy control isn't there as the large band just folded over."
3.0,"The flag graphic on this tank only has 48 stars.  The graphic is also more shiny/plasticky looking than I care for.  The material was light and very soft.  I was also hoping it would be longer than it is.  It's more of a boxy shape.  I ended up returning it.  If it was cheaper I might not have bothered, but it wasn't worth the price."
3.0,was too small; sending it back
3.0,"Ordered this for myself, I'm a big dude, and was going to get a 3x, but noticed a lot of reviews saying it was too small, so I ordered a 4x. Well.. 1st, it took about 2 months to come in(1 star gone). 2nd. I got a 5x... (that's another star). 3rd that 5x was tiny(star 3). Like as in, I ended up giving it to my mom, who is 5'3 and 125 pounds, and it fit her perfectly. All that said; it is actually well made, and looks great, and my mom loves it, so Merry Christmas mom(added 1 star back)... So there you go..."
3.0,"While this necklace was exactly as described, it was a little lightweight which made it an item that I returned. But it was exactly as pictured, and it was in perfect shape when it arrived."
3.0,Color looks more yellow
3.0,Se enrollan muy rapido
3.0,"I’m usually a large in leggings or a 10-12 in jeans and bought a median. When I got it, it looked really small, I felt scared because as someone who has a big bum, it’s hard to get tight things over the bum. I managed to get it on and it made my stomach look good which is good but it’s a little uncomfortable below and I’m sure it’ll hurt more with time. This does roll even if I’m standing up straight it’ll still roll down from the top. Would recommend to those who don’t mind the product rolling and if they only want their stomach snatched."
3.0,It's a little short.. when you put it on it either makes your upper body bulge or gives you like a pouch at the tummy.. im 250 and 5'4 and the size 2xxl was alright other than it kept folding down at the top of the back. Not comfortable unless you wanted to stand all day... it was ok.
3.0,"I'm top heavy and the top fit well, unfortunately, they bottoms were small."
3.0,The ears and tail are very small even for my petite 12 yr old daughter. The headband fits perfectly for her so to say its for a younger kid - this would not work.
3.0,Returned this product as it did not look like the picture. Dark grey and seemed cheaper then most G-Shocks purchased previously.
3.0,Wore it for like 4 days before the handcuffs snapped. Was really cute so I'm kinda disappointed
3.0,"I was excited to get this pendant but then quickly disappointed when I saw one of the corners was chipped off and the stone did not have any blue or iridescent flashes, which is common with laboradite. It was just pretty much grey and plain looking."
3.0,It did not meet my needs of being able to fit a pair of shoes in both side pockets. Besides that it is okay.
3.0,Very thin material. Feels cheep.
3.0,"This product just has a weird cut.  Body on size med cut on the smaller size width-wise, but arms are big (not long, but big like lots of extra fabric in the upper arms).  Size large body was huge and arms weren't that much bigger.... just didn't work for us.  Med body was also borderline on the short side - so it would be ok if it didn't shrink a bit, but we all know a moderate amount of shrinkage is to be expected particularly in the length.  Side note: quality seems 'ok'.  Lots of loose threads that would make me think twice about keeping even if I could get a size that worked for my husband."
3.0,It looks great but will break easily.
3.0,"Corre pequeño muy pequeño, no me gusto, es bonito"
3.0,the frames were to big for my face. they seem to be of good quality and came with a case etc. I wanted to love these
3.0,"Meh. Fabric isn't that comfortable, design is plain and a bit brighter than the picture."
3.0,"This was not made for tall women unless maybe if very skinny. I’m 5’7” and this shirt is petite, too short and wide."
3.0,It was broken when we received it. I had to glue it to reattach the leaf.  it was larger than expected.
3.0,I have washed this twice and each time the lint basket was full. I don't know if this will continue or not but if it does I don't think it will last very long.
3.0,it's good material but the problem with the color will changed in one week after use :( !
3.0,"Love this. Felt like a true 90’s babe, just on the snug side as it runs small."
3.0,These run big. They are also a but thin.
3.0,Nice. Price and quality are in accordance.
3.0,These run a bit short...
3.0,"Snug, but tantalizing. Have had good experiences iwth it, but not something you'd want to wear all day."
3.0,Definitely buy a half size smaller. Super cute. Packaging has be second guessing the safety of the material. I do not know if it is the Silica or shoe material the Prop 65 warning is about.<br />&#34;This product contains a chemical know to the state of California to cause cancer or other reproductive harm. Do not allow children to mouth or chew.&#34;
3.0,Good for price. Light material. Cheaper appearing.
3.0,"The product is longer than what it appears on the picture. It was poorly packaged for shipping. I purchased this product in 4 different colors and all 4 shurgs were stuffed in a small bag. In addition, when I opened the bag the package tape was stuck to one of the shurgs which pulled at the material.  There was little white pieces of lint or some type of material on each one of the shurgs. I am conteplating returning them."
3.0,"I really needed a pair of compression socks being that i work in a hospital and I am constantly on my feet. After wearing these, I can honestly say that my legs and lower back don't hurt as bad as they did before, however, my only complaint is that the hearts on these socks leave imprints on my legs, so when I take them off, I have to wait a good 30-45 minutes before I can walk around in shorts or capris. I will definitely buy another pair from this company, but I will steer clear of the prints to avoid imprints on my legs."
3.0,Fits ok. Order one size up for American market
3.0,"Reviews are all over the place so here my 2 cents...sleeves and length fit and fabric is nice but I ordered a large and it is way to small. I normally wear a large in compression shirts such as bayleaf and underarmor and fit very nice but I could barely wrestle this shirt on. I'm 5'9"" 170 and pretty fit so a large normally fits good. I do have an oneil XXL and fits snug so varies from brands. This is all I wear so I have many shirts! I'm afraid to order a larger size as the sleeves and length may be way to long."
3.0,"Ordered for my daughter, wasn’t entirely happy as they didn’t glow like I thought even after days under light. Cute necklace though."
3.0,"La lana no es lo que me esperaba, se ve ordinario."
3.0,"I think it would be better if it was 24'' , but it does what it should do,"
3.0,I thought it would have an elastic opening but it didn’t and ripped immediately
3.0,Love the bottoms<br />The top seems a little cheaply made especially the cups
3.0,"Beautiful piece, sadly stones loose and we’re already unglued upon arrival."
3.0,"I liked this shirt so much that I bought it in every available color. But then after a couple of months they all started falling apart. The pocket starts to rip and eventually the material gets very week. The shirts do not stand up to machine-washing, I suppose. The black one I had, the buttons started coming off even after I'd sew them back on because I'd sew them tightly and it would damage the fabric.<br /><br />Eventually the black shirt got caught on a door and ripped along the entire seam on the right side, right up to the armpit. That was the death knell. I use the remaining three shirts for around-the-house but I don't use them for work anymore"
3.0,Nice and heavy! If you do not like heavy earrings these are definitely not for you. Pretty upset one arrived broken though 😕
3.0,"Stylish, professional, offers multiple functions. Only complaint is that it's bulky. It seems to have unnecessary straps. I like that it is convertible into a briefcase. If it were avail I would give 3.5 stars."
3.0,better than expected still works
3.0,"Darker than a welding mask.  I love these glasses for the full on sunlight of a summer day at the golf course, for everything else they are too dark and you can't see color.  If they would just take the tint down a little they would be great."
3.0,They were smaller than what I expected but I still think that they are cute.
3.0,"Ordered 2xl, too small.  Had to return and select different hoodie."
3.0,Beautiful material. Good light weight hoodie. Size too small. Perfect for preteen granddaughter.
3.0,"The belt seems to be fine, but their sizing chart did not suggest the right size. Will be replacing with one size up."
3.0,It is very tricky to put on and keep  on.
3.0,"I loved the tie die...my kids are laying claims on it.  however this is just a spring light cover.  It's labeled like a legit deal...but I really hope it's not.  The material is thinner...and the stich work is terrible.  I know this because my seams were coming apart.  I took my garment to a friend who does sowing for a living and she looked over the item and said how bad it was and hoped that I didn't pay to much for it.  Well....I'm happy with it.  but, don't expect a thick cover that holds it's shape....this is not that kind of item."
3.0,"Fit fine for size med.Fabric is  some what thin,bought to wear under my army color jacket and this works well."
3.0,"The glasses do what I wanted but one of the lenses fell out in less than a month.  While there is a screw to loosen the frame to put the lens back in, I wasn't able to turn it and thus could not repair it.  I ended up getting a different pair with a stronger frame."
3.0,"Soft fabric, nice colors and print, BUT the 6xl is more like a 3-4xl.  I wanted loose and flowy.  I got snug and straight.  The bust is really tight on me.  The bottom half hugs my tummy and butt.  I know we are all shaped differently, but the dress on me looks nothing like it seems to on other women who reviewed it…This is H&M sizing right here. A bit disappointed."
3.0,Cute not quite as the picture
3.0,"Aimur seller is a better fit and quality. Same style, different designer. Aimur is much better!"
3.0,"Returned, not magnetic lens. Got the arrow model, it's fab. Will review that next."
3.0,Thick and warm But very slippery. Should put grippies on bottom.
3.0,"Item smaller than I thought.  The mistake was totally mine.  The description states  17mm,  but for some reason I thought they were a little larger.  I would say this item would be better suited for a small child."
3.0,They weren’t what expected
3.0,"We like the shirt, but the neck hole is so big it falls over our son's shoulder and looks sloppy."
3.0,Too big for toddlers
3.0,It was smaller than expected. If you’re looking for an oversized cardigan like it’s shown on the model than you’ll want to size up.
3.0,"I am so surprised at how comfortable these are, they are pretty, and fit perfectly. however when I received them, one of the booties had a scratch."
3.0,chain was ALOT longer then expected
3.0,"I was disappointed it was kind of a pink gold, I was hoping for more of a yellow gold. But it fits and I'm content. Can't beat the price. Didn't take that long to arrive."
3.0,"The arm holes of the sleeves are too small! It looks great on, but is almost impossible to take off. Have to shimmy your arms out inch by inch."
3.0,I am 6ft 225lb and the shirt is WAY to tight. Chain links come off easily too
3.0,When I received it the top ring to attach to another key chain was not attached. I had to use a pair something to open the smaller ring so that way the lager ring can be attached.
3.0,Fabric was snug but basically true to what's in the picture
3.0,"I ordered another pair since the 1st ones worked so well, but the ones I received were shorter in length. They are very comfortable and provide excellent compression."
3.0,"Purchased 2x ,it fits like a large."
3.0,"My son really loves this hoodie.  However, the color seemed to fade over time, but maybe that is to be expected."
3.0,The shirt is NOT cotton. It's a cling material. Would have liked it more if it was actually cotton
3.0,"This shirt feels like a biking shirt, you know that silky activity fabric. If you’re looking to wear it to work out in then it is great!!!! Long and sleek cut."
3.0,Cute but the medium was way too small could barely get it on and it didn't cover my chest at all.  I'm 5'6 and 115 lbs.  Going by the clothing sizes a medium should have worked.  It got here fast and I will probably get a bigger size.
3.0,"Good material and fit, but was too long. Too long to wear outside a pants and a lot to tuck in."
3.0,"Great tierra, sash, buttons.  The tattoos are junk."
3.0,"These are super cute. But after 3-4 wears, they started coming apart at the tire. However, they served their purpose during our vacation and the price point was perfect."
3.0,"This dress was slightly disappointing. Cheap material and felt like “Halloween costume in a bag” quality. Shorter than expected (I’m 5’ 9” and 140 pounds) see pic. the top of the dress and sleeves are pretty loose, not like the photo. Baggy even. That being said, I’ll still be wearing it for Vegas, because it was cheap and I’ll probably end up trashing it. Get what you pay for."
3.0,It's a little on the small side so beware especially if you are busty but overall I like the fit.
3.0,Order at least one size up if you want a snug fit and two if you want some breathing room.
3.0,"I liked the light to show it was on. The battery did not seem to last what they said, however the jacket alone is warmer than expected.  Didn’t spread heat like I hoped.  Going to try another one."
3.0,I purchased these for work and they ran small. I had to return them.
3.0,Super cute but it doesn’t fit your entire glasses in it.  About a good inch and a half sticks out so it won’t protect them.  It’s basically a stuffed animal you can partially put your glasses in.
3.0,This set is made of extremely thin and flimsy material. The top was very small but the shorts fit okay. I like the design of the fabric but I would not buy again.
3.0,Looks like junk you got from a garage sale that belonged to your great grandma that died a long time ago.
3.0,5’2” 135 lbs. I bought a medium and I should have bought a large. It’s small in the arms and tight in the chest. Fabric is nice to thin. Might purchase again in a large.
3.0,It's good material but fits kinda roomy.
3.0,not bad just too small
3.0,"The pocket squares are nice enough i suppose. The material is in line with the pricing. I would say that half of the colors are something I don't every see myself ever wearing so in my opinion I would have been better off buying the squares in singles.  Additionally, they are all white squares with color lined edges so the look is nearly identical for each item."
3.0,Disappointed as I thought alpaca socks would help keep my always cold tootsies warm.  That didn't happen.  These are thinner than I would have expected and my feet were still cold walking around the house.
3.0,"I received this in the mail today, got the pretty baby pink color, the fabric feels really nice as its I think at least 70% cotton, the length would be perfect for my height, but the arm hole and the chest area are too tight, I cant even go past my shoulders. Such a shame I have to return this without being even able to try it."
3.0,"We love the cuff and slap bracelet, however, the construction is not the best.  It looked fine when it arrived but now it is falling apart.<br />The velcro is glued into place on the cuff and it couldn't hold up to just a week's worth of wear.  The velcro began pulling away from the cuff and was hanging about half way on and half way off.<br />I flipped the sequins near the seem in opposite directions to reveal the fabric and sewed the velcro back into place.  all the other parts of the bracelet and cuff seem to be fine at this point.<br />Either order knowing that it will require some simple reinforcement, or go with another brand."
3.0,A little tough to unfold and put on for a kid. But love the bag it comes in and they work well.
3.0,"The photo depicts this as mini dress length, but this barely covered my bum. Maybe if you have zero curves...<br />That said, it's a good color and very comfortable."
3.0,They do reduce the level of noise. I bought them to use next month at a theme park so that is the big test.
3.0,Love this outfit but after a a wash the wording starts to peel.
3.0,They were alot smaller then I expected they will only fit for right now
3.0,The size and colors were Ok.<br />The material - very poor quality.
3.0,Was great for the first few months before the zipper broke :-/
3.0,"It keeps twisting because it doesn't have the weight to stop it. So as just a chain, it doesn't work great."
3.0,"Personally, this bag didn't work for me. The cross body strap isn't nearly long enough. When wearing the bag, it hits me at a really awkward height. I personally prefer my bags to be at hip level and this sat well above that; even with the strap fully extended. I'll probably end up replacing the strap with a similar material from a fabric store, but still, it's sort of annoying that I'm going to have to modify it. The quality looks pretty good and that's the only reason that I'm willing to put any effort into it."
3.0,"This product is well made and was delivered on time, but if you have a booty I'd order a size. That's just me tho.."
3.0,"Positives:<br />- warm! They really have a double layer<br />- stretchy, good sizing, stay up<br />-long leg warmers (actually mid thigh or above)<br />-not made of plastic (aka polyester, acrylic... etc.)<br />Negatives:<br />- arrived damaged at the bottom (see pics)<br />-too fragile! After a couple uses only (not even really moving, just lounging around the house) started showing signs of wear, threads poking out in many places (see pics).<br /><br />Usually, people using leg warmers will want to exercise in them, and you can be sure that even yoga will be too much for these to handle. You really have to treat them like a silk scarf, something so precious it can barely be touched. That is not what most people need from leg warmers. Considering the high price, this is even more upsetting.<br />Don't get me wrong, I liked the idea of having leg warmers not made out of plastic, and was ready to pay the price for it. And they feel really nice to the touch. But I need to be able to wear them without worrying about damaging them every step I take. I suspect a lot of it is due to the poor weaving design (very loose, easily catching on anything).<br />On the whole, disappointing for such a steep price."
3.0,The zipper was very hard to deal with. It popped open all the time. Love the belted fit. I kept it because I spilled on it and could not return it
3.0,Very cute but very thin!
3.0,I got two of these gis a few months apart.  The first one fit great and was the best value ever.  The second same size was about 3 inches shorter.
3.0,Fit nice but make it impossible to breathe
3.0,Kinda small would be great for a child
3.0,"I liked the belly chain but the gems did not go all of the way around. The picture was unclear because it only showed a portion of the chain, (with the gems) but didn't show that this was only part of the chain. I found another product online but a comparable price that had stones all of the way around. It was still a nice purchase because it's unique and fun to wear on vacation at the pool.  Not sure I would purchase this one again"
3.0,"Ugh it pains me to write this review. I was so so super excited when this arrived because it is exactly what I wanted in a kimono. The colors are beautiful, the fit is flattering, it is light and breezy and airy enough to withstand the heat here. I was all set to write my glowing review of just how lovely and perfect it is. However, upon inspection I found that it is cheaply made and had a hole in the arm pit (in the same location as other reviewers mention having one or getting one after a wear or two.) When I saw it, my heart was broken. I'm really tempted to buy another and hope it holds up better, but I don't want to get stuck with something that doesn't even last a season. I know you get what you pay for, but you won't even get that if you don't get a season of use out of it. No one wants a $14 cost per wear!<br /><br />I'm so bummed! :("
3.0,Love the necklace only received two out of the three
3.0,Heal hangs off of shoe!
3.0,"These are very cute!  They look good quality. I was disappointed that they didn't fit my wide calf, but they did fit my 8 year old just fine."
3.0,Little tie for my wrist
3.0,"It's a $10 watch, so it's hard to be disappointed and I'm not. It's smaller than I thought it would be, but I still can tell time with it.<br />The band is almost too small, I have to wear  it on the last hole. I have large wrists, about 9.25"" around so if you have larger wrists than that, don't get this watch."
3.0,Even though they button the one I tried on felt restrictive.  There do not appear to be size options for a plus-size person.  I think I would have liked them otherwise.
3.0,Mixed reviews. They're cute in the pictures but kind of fit a little weird if you have hips.
3.0,"Good quality,  fast shipping,  but sizes run small"
3.0,"Their made to fit everyone but the problem is, I'm a size 18 and because their made to fit larger sizes they fall off me when I wear them.  All day I'm pulling them up."
3.0,"Fits small in the shoulders, need to return"
3.0,"Liked the jacket, but runs a bit small."
3.0,"This is a nice looking pair of boots that fit well. However, the top is extremely stiff and digs into my leg above my foot when I walk. I plan to try wearing thick high socks to see if it helps but I think it's just how they are designed. May be fine for people with super skinny ankles."
3.0,It was okay. Nothing too fancy
3.0,Was hoping for a more baggy feel but fit is slightly smaller than baggy.
3.0,I washed this before letting my son wear it. There were already strangs of the fabric coming off on the inside of the shirt and shorts. He'll likely only get to wear this set a handful of times.
3.0,"Nice item, but much smaller than what I expected."
3.0,"It says specifically it would accommodate my wrist (I am a grown woman) but I'm on the last hole and it's STILL too large and loose.  I don't feel like going thru the return process, I will have to add a hole (don't know how - yet).<br />Would not recommend to people with small wrists. Other than that it's OK."
3.0,"Easy to install, not crazy about plastic lenses, couldn't find glass replacement lenses.<br />Steve"
3.0,Got em for my wife's cold nose....cold gone
3.0,Small. Ok if you have short hair.
3.0,we've returned the large and have received a medium which fits much better...
3.0,The picture is printed very thickly (?) onto the shirt. It’s very large and feels cheap.
3.0,1 of 3 rings came in a size 8 instead of 9
3.0,"This edema to be a nice blouse, thicker material, color slightly different that photo but nice. It fit perfect. BUT the front in squared and boxy- not good for me."
3.0,"This product broke during the first use; specifically, the shoulder strap separated itself from the swimsuit top. It is totally cute, just not well made. I didn’t wear it right away, so the return window has passed which is not super fun, but I thought I would come on here and warn that the quality might be lacking. Again, adorable, I loved it and got lots of complements; but not durable."
3.0,"I like, but WHY do they have to use a bright florescent yellow drawstring?  And why couldn't they put it inside the shorts instead of on the outside.  Fashion?  Bah Humbug.  I solved the problem by poking a hole thru the elastic waistband to the inside and re-threading the cord so it's no longer visible.<br /><br />At least the price is right.  Haven't washed them yet, so no comment on any shrinkage, fading or bleeding.<br /><br />Inseam length of 5""  Outseam is 16.5""  Leg opening is a little big (for me) with a 26"" circumference, but acceptable.<br /><br />For better or worse, there is a white mesh liner which I consider a little loose but again: acceptable.  I might cut it out but time will tell.  Side pockets are made out of the same white mesh.  Wish they had used black, as depending on your exercise routine and contortions, it's possible they might show.  Back pocket (4.5""x5"") with a velcro'd flap is good sized for a wallet but not big enough for a larger phone.<br /><br />I'd rate them a great buy at the $7 pricepoint, but hate the yellow drawstring.<br /><br />( US Male, bought the CN:Large, usually wear a US Medium [+/-] depending on the Manufacturer. )"
3.0,"Very clear, but sits too close to mouth. Gets lipstick on it.<br />Very comfortable around ears"
3.0,Heads up to anyone out here purchasing these the sizes are way more than a little off. I ordered 4xl as it said to order a size up. I’m usually a 3xl. The shorts clearly are marked 4xl but were so small they fit my son in law that wears a med/large. He seems to like them so I can at least say that as a positive. Just be wary of the sizing.
3.0,"It is pretty but looks cheap, considering the price I didnt expect too much. Was missing a stone on arrival, the color is a weird peach that does not look rose gold to me and it is too big although I ordered my size."
3.0,"I sized up for these, and really thought they would be super comfy - and they would be if the waistband were of a little better quality. Unfortunately it’s a small, tight elastic aged one that starts to dig in after a while. A thicker, softer waistband would make them perfect, because otherwise the fit is really lovely."
3.0,I am having a problem with the band staying fastened.  The excess band does not stay in the hoop and when that happens it comes unhooked from the metal hook. I have had my watch for 2 years and have bought a variety of bands this is the first time it has ever fallen off my wrist. Actually twice now
3.0,"I'm 6'4&#34; ordered a large, fits great. The material though is cheap and feels rough. I wouldn't suggest this shirt."
3.0,If you have a son who’s husky with a big butt and wide hips not for him Doesn’t stretch more like a slim to medium size child plus side is I have three boys so it fit my other son Will fit into a size 10/12 loose I purchased the size 14 so size runs small
3.0,It's ok. Rusts  quickly.
3.0,"Very warm so I'm keeping them for that reason. But they have a few flaws that I feel reflect badly on the brand.  There are quite a few loose threads and a section of the sweats that look like someone accidentally dripped bleach on them before they shipped out.  Or maybe they didn't completely dip the fabric in the black color.  It stands out and is quite noticeable. They're definitely not flattering; the pockets are oversized and make the waist area much too tight.  I have sweats I bought from Walmart, with pockets, that fit better and only cost me $8.  I was expecting them to be a little bit bulky, they're sweats after all.  But the legs fit very comfortably and the waist is too confining."
3.0,I was a CNA at the time and needed a watch that I could use for vitals on patients. This did the trick just perfectly. Loved the bright pink! My only complaint is the alarm on it wouldn't stop beeping every couple hours. I tried to fix it but no luck.
3.0,"I will wear this dress again, but I'm going to sew lining into the dress. The dress is spandex so there is some give, I love the pockets on it. I'm short and even with 5&#34; heels the dress was still too long. If you're a short girl, you may want to take this one up. It would be one of the best dress in my collection if it wasn't just the spandex materials (under side of fabric is white) even with a black bra it will show as if it's white. I guess, it's okay for the price."
3.0,"Comes in 2 small bags, no directions. Creativity needed to create objective. Once figured out. Good product."
3.0,"These boots are extremely cute, unique and comfortable. I had the pleasure of wearing them TWICE. The 2nd time I wore them the sole separated from the boot on one of them. I haven't worn them since. I received several compliments the 2 times they were worn. It's unfortunate I won't be wearing them again and am past the time limit for returns."
3.0,"Wasn't sure how to rate this because the fabric is nice but the design needs a bit of tweaking. Like another reviewer said, there is way too much fabric at the top by the shoulders that it makes you look bigger than you actually are which is not very flattering. The length and size chart were accurate. I'm 5' 3"" and it didn't hit the floor for me. The waist was just right, with no give in the fabric, and sits higher up than my natural waist, just underneath the breasts."
3.0,Wonderful blouse but fits very tight. The sleeves are flowing and cute but the material will fit you tight on chest and stomach. Light weight and stretchy but very fitted
3.0,Not a true fit.  Too small.
3.0,Wanted to try the style and not super into it on myself. My eyelashes rubbed against the lenses. Overall just felt like a cheaply made pair of sunglasses.
3.0,Did not hold up after one wash. Seams started to unravel and tears in the tank tops. They smell terrible as well!
3.0,"I was disappointed that this bra had no pads. Its so pretty that Id love to wear it without a shirt if im working outside, but I feel like I cant without pads.... plus it was a tad on the small side and doesnt contain all that it needs to."
3.0,"Looks cute, but the quality is cheaper than expected."
3.0,"Was expecting some type of cup to it, no support at all."
3.0,I weigh 150 with large hands not a big guy. More money wasted because they made xl gloves that are too small.
3.0,"I like it but it is not the same print as in the picture, the material is sheer so I wear it as a duster, I have gotten a lot of compliments. It is a little small in the arms but the length is perfect! I am 5'11 this comes to around my mid-calf."
3.0,"Looked super cute but if you've got boobs and hips, order a size or two up"
3.0,I didn’t expect it to be exactas pictured as is it an animal however I did expect it to be some sort of cow print and not solid white!
3.0,"These are super cute!  The fit is great, they are just rough to break in. My only issue with these is that I ordered the tan suede pair and I got a black pair. .... I still like them so I kept them."
3.0,"These camisoles run VERY small. I ordered an XL. I wear a medium to a large shirt, and the camisole is way too small."
3.0,"I was so excited when I got this and opened the package.  The material is very soft and I could hardly it wait to wash it and wear it.  I probably should try stuff on first but after washing it and putting it on for the first time, I had to let the shoulder straps completely out to even get the top of the gown close to where it should hang so that the cut is close to accurate.  I am not a tall woman by any means, 5'4&#34; but I can barely keep the empire part of the gown down far enough.  I love ordering night gowns off Amazon for selection but from now on, I'll stick to Target and Kohls with brands that I know will not come cut crooked and cost the same."
3.0,While these are cute. The earrings are rather large. I bought them for my 5 year old so I was hoping they were going to be tiny. I would have definitely keep them if the kitty faces were smaller.
3.0,The look of it was on point. However material quality is not good!
3.0,One of the rhinestones came off the first time I opened the package. I glued it back on and haven't had an issue since.
3.0,"It holds me in a little, but not much. It definitely doesn’t fit like a US size 0. It’s closer to a 2, or maybe even a 4. I love the range of colors, though, and it provides good lift for my boobs."
3.0,"Dress fit great and was very soft, but the yellow top didn’t match the yellow I was going for in my theme"
3.0,"Cute dress, very light, however the white is definitely too thin for my liking. I just purchased a slip to go underneath and it looks great! More family friendly lol. It would make a great complement to a bathing suit however, if it was for a beach trip!"
3.0,"this is a cute dress, love the criss-cross back.  the fabric description is wrong.  I checked the sideseam tag - is actually poly-spandex, silky stretchy, drapes nicely.  it is very wide across, but almost too short to be worn as a dress.  while I dont like squeeze or bodycon at all, at 5'5"", 46"" bust, I swim in this XXL.  quite a surprise - most of the time asian-sized dresses run soo small.  like the dress well enough to take this black one in on the sides, and order the rose-grey in a size L."
3.0,Got these for my daughter and she liked the dice design but struggled to twist the ends on. She was so frustrated with them cross threading she is unable to secure ends to wear them.
3.0,"The charm is nice, but the chain cannot be sterling silver, tarnished bad"
3.0,love the look but there's no stability with it and it just lay open
3.0,The picture his a bit different and seems shorter.
3.0,Gave these away. They were way too small
3.0,The ear piece on loops comes off to easy
3.0,"This is a cute bag.  However it smells horrible.  Hopefully once I air it out, out won't smell so bad.  Also, the picture makes it look like there is a zip section all the way across the center of the bag.. there isn't,  it's just a small zip pouch at the back inside of the bag  and it doesn't hold much.  The outside back pocket is a nice place to stash my phone.  I wouldn't order this bag again.  The inside material is cheap and I expect it will rip sooner rather than later."
3.0,After a few washings now very tight to wear.
3.0,"i ordered an XL which is what i normally wear. what i received was bigger than i expected and is really loose and the sleeves were long. it felt more like an XXL. there’s no way for me to verify because there is no tag or label on this shirt that will indicate to me its actual size.<br />I like that it is linen and could still wear it like a blazer over a tshirt but would have to fold the sleeves to make it work for me.<br />on the other hand, it could have been a mistake in pulling the order size but i couldnt tell really."
3.0,My wife put these on our baby and I was like hell no. She looks like a stripper.  A baby stripper.
3.0,UPDATE: 2/9/22 - the small key ring that holds the Apple to the lanyard broke today. Was so flimsily made that it broke trying to take the lanyard out of my purse. The hole is too close to the top and also bottom.  Very disappointed!<br /><br />The Apple on the lanyard and the pencil beads match the picture perfectly.  My only concern is how thin the string is for the lanyard itself. It’s as thin as sewing string. I carry a lot on my lanyard for my day to day job.
3.0,Everything about this bag is good but its size is just too small for an adult maybe a kid or a teenager just sad because it has great pockets.
3.0,"Too stretchy for me. I ordered a small, but I would need an<br />X-small in these but it's not offered. I bet they look great on those who actually have a butt. Very comfortable and I'm sad that they fit too baggy. I'm 5'3"" and 110lbs with a flat booty."
3.0,Teeny tiny itsy bitsy miniscule small microscopic. Unlarge.
3.0,Light and functional. I use them for cycling so I can read the fitness/map on my phone. Readers could be bigger.
3.0,"Maybe the manufacturer caught on to the comments about these dressing running small, because mine was HUGE!  My daughter is a 5/7 in juniors, so we ordered the large, thinking it ran small.  It is about a women's 12! I can take it in and hem it (comes to middle of her knees, and she's 5'5&quot;).  Looking at it, we were worried that a smaller size might result in the waist being too high. Anyway, we ordered the paint splatter design, and it is pretty.  Great colors."
3.0,the pin itself is very beautiful. it is vibrant and the colors are so nice. I sadly returned it because on the screen it looks like yellow white  orange black and teal. When it arrived it was all those colors and dark purple. some of the parts that look black are black and purple. i bought this to match a dress that was black orange yellow white and olive. With a dress that had so many colors my pin needed to be pretty spot on the purple was just too much for my dress. the blue is not an issue becuse it is so little but the purple is pretty dominant and just didn't look good with my dress so i returned it. The return was lightening quick and hassle free which i appreciated. I just wanted everyone to know about the purple. the pin is lovely but i was on a mission to get a pin that matched my dress. I picked on that was enamel but i really wanted rhinestone and was so excited when i saw this one. Too bad i couldn't see the purple on my screen because it is such a pretty pin.
3.0,Love the look but too stiff. Much too stiff. I put saddle soap in it but no luck. Hopefully it will soften up with use. It’s actually hard getting cash out of it.
3.0,The clasp won't close so I'm going to have to Magyver it to shut but the bracelet itself is pretty cool looking. I don't know who has wrists as giant as whoever they designed this for but it's too large to sit on your hand like in the picture. Definitely a little DIY to get this thing to fit.
3.0,Larger than I thought they would be!
3.0,They are very tight!! Very narrow ankles and hard to get on.<br />The waist would be fine if I could get them up my leg....<br />They currently look great sitting in my closet.
3.0,They bwere too heavy for me - even the small one was much heavier than i could manage easily.
3.0,I absolutely loved this band however I was wearing it and all of a sudden it was gone. Looked everywhere for it. It just disappeared. So sad. Would buy again but on a budget.
3.0,Bought as a pool cover up. Tissue paper thin and flimsy. Can be worn as a top with jeans and a tank top but forget pool use. Took months to be delivered...had forgotten I even ordered the thing.
3.0,Smaller than appeared and looked cheap
3.0,The dress is very pretty but is a size small
3.0,"I initially purchased this top because it looked great in the picture, and after reading a couple of other reviews, erred on the side of caution and went with a Large since general consensus is that this shirt runs small. Shipping was quick and I had no complaints about the design or quality of the top itself, but unfortunately even a Large was a little too tight for me. I don't consider myself large-chested by far, but the top isn't very stretchy and I felt constrained every time I tried to breathe. Eventually decided to return it. If you're comfortable with clothes that cling to your skin, this would be worth the purchase, but if you prefer slightly looser clothing, I would consider other options."
3.0,"I don’t have a big butt and yet you can see my skin and my underwear while wearing these. I’m a small/medium in any leggings or not numbered size pants I’ve ever gotten. I can’t wear them out in public unless I have a huge shirt, jacket, or a dress on. Really sad about that because that’s a big part of the reason I wanted these warm ones for winter. Definitely order a size up."
3.0,The dress is ok but its VERY loose around the waist ...the arms fit perfect if you dont have big arms...the chest and lower body area is fine but the wait doesn't fit and not sure how to fix it being that it has pleats in the middle...might have to return it
3.0,These are pretty small.  Print os cute and very bright.
3.0,"It doesn't have raised buttons like I had expected - so looked cheaper than I had hoped. Also, I cannot charge my phone while its in the cover and the side buttons are so hard to push down. I used it for about two days and decided to scrap it. Otherwise I could see it helping to protect my phone."
3.0,First of all let me state that I LOVE THIS WATCH! But I've only had it for a week now and am having a weird issue where the digits are are not displaying on a specific section of the display! This issue just presented itself today and am going to send back to Amazon and get replacement that hopefully wont do this?!! Will update the review once I receive return unit. A pic below of the issue
3.0,like this dress.
3.0,"If you get the right size considering<br />They run VERY, VERY SMALL.<br />then they are worth $12.01<br />Dont go by their measurements<br />They are not accurate."
3.0,a bit stiff
3.0,Looks great. I love it.<br /><br />However the battery or mechanisms gave out in a few months&idk how or where to get or replace them.
3.0,"Good quality, cheap price, very cute, runs very small, and does NOT fit you if you're tall ladies!! I'm 5' 9&#34; and it doesn't fit length wise as well as runs small"
3.0,"Loves this jacket , apart from the pockets where not sow properly, so I had to resow both both pockets"
3.0,They look great but they are just too small
3.0,"These boots were listed  as mid-calf, yet they were knee high. They were also too big-size 39 and I usually wear an 8.5, and the zipper stuck in same place going up and down.  I only tried on one boot and returned them.  Hassle free return and speedy refund!!"
3.0,a little cheap looking came in a small plastic bag all crumpled up.  Not at all what i would like to see
3.0,"It was a nice color, but the shirt was smaller than expected.  Way too tight to look good.  Had to return it for a larger size."
3.0,SO SO
3.0,The color was not as clear as the others ones I have purchased
3.0,"I bought a pair of these to replace a lost pair of Oakleys. I have a pair of the Elite glasses that i use for shooting, and thought i would try these out. The lenses are really nice, providing a neutral color which some other polarized lenses don't provide. The only challenge i have is that the lenses are very delicate (which is ironic due to all the safety certifications they have), and scratched badly after about 3 months usage.<br /><br />Bottom line, i would buy two pair of these next time or just go back to Oakleys who's lenses are much sturdier."
3.0,"Very pretty and soft, feels well made but if you have a large chest and a smaller waist like me it will just hang off your chest and give you a very unflattering silhouette. Wish it cinched in at the waist more. I have a hard body shape to shop for so I dont fault the dress at all."
3.0,"decent quality, but not as sharp/clear as some glasses I bout years ago."
3.0,Nice but material is suuper thin so I returned it
3.0,Fits true to size; however it is  thin material
3.0,LOOKS VERY NICE WHEN U WEAR A SIMPLE OUTFIT. IT DRESSES YOU UP.... I WORE IT ON THANKSGIVING DAY AND ALL MY FRIENDS/RELATIVES LOVED IT
3.0,"Pros: material is super stretchy, was able to carefully compress 4 days worth of clothes and toiletries into it.<br /><br />Cons: Wayyy smaller than I thought it would be. I almost returned it for a large size until I found I could make my things fit (I had to roll up all of my clothes, and the zipper still struggled to close). It's about the size of a large purse or tote bag. I can't imagine what the small looks like."
3.0,"Just “Ok” for the price but will not buy again! Sleepers heals lost the form after just 5 days of use, and I do not have any problem with my feet’s just in case!"
3.0,"They are lovely., lite weight.. a bit tarnished but they were pretty cheap."
3.0,I order a small and my small is like extra large on my. I’m swimming in it. I went pass the date to return it so now I’m suck with it.
3.0,Pedí estas blusas para mi niña de 6 y le quedaron un poco pequeños al final le quedaron a la de 4
3.0,No muy buen acabado
3.0,I haven't tested the cut resistant property.  They'd need to be cut resistant if you plan on handling anything sharp.  They have no grip at all.  I like the concept enough that I plan to try adding a no-slip coating the the palms and inside of fingers. I'll post an update.
3.0,May have to return based on size
3.0,It came BEFORE it was promised. I LOVE the color.Love the extra pearl accent.<br /> The 'fur' is obviously fake :(  - I wish the quality of the fake fur were better<br />I think I will utilize on my wallet and not on the outside of my purse as I had hoped to do
3.0,"I misunderstood the description and thought these were all one inch buttons. They didn't work for the jacket I had purchased them for, so I returned them."
3.0,"Love the design but the fit was so tight I had to send it back, then I got the 9 and the fit was so loose I had to send it back. It seems there was just no winning on this one :( Tragic really cause otherwise they're adorable shoes."
3.0,This dress is very warm and fits alright although its not stylish or flattering. I kept it to wear around the house.
3.0,Returned them because of massive waist and no draw string. A little thin but super cute.
3.0,This was a christmas gift to my daugther from my son.  She loves it!!!!
3.0,"If I was five feet tall this sweater would be great, but I'm not. C-"
3.0,"Ordered 32W 30L pants, but had to return them. They were at least 4 inches too long! The label did show 32W 30L, but this pair must have been mislabeled. Fabric seemed durable but not very comfortable."
3.0,Returned. Did not fit as expected
3.0,"It’s really high, like i would lift up my arms and it would show my bra… other than that its super adorable and cutesy! We did have to return it through, would recommend to teenagers!"
3.0,Small in the hips. Definitely waterproof.
3.0,"I've never had my ears periced, so I've always worn clip ons some are more comfortable than other though. These looked just like the picture very pretty delicate. The clip I feel like shows a bit much unless you have bigger earlobes like mine. But they were good earrings I didn't really like the comfortableness of them though. They'd start to hurt after a while and I'd have to take them off."
3.0,Really a cute dress for the money but wasnt flattering on me. I returned it and got my refund the same day.
3.0,"I ordered this pair of pants in my usual size in Alfred Dunner but found them to be a little too small.  I could wear them, but not comfortably.  Also, I didn't care for the fabric which was fairly flimsy.  I don't think the item will hold up to many washings.  Sorry.  I really like  my old Dunner zip fly jeans, but the company doesn't seem to be offering them anymore."
3.0,AFO's wouldn't fit in the shoe. Once foot with AFO was inserted the shoe wouldn't zip up. Shoe was right size just not right width
3.0,"I bought this thinking the fabric had some stretch to it, but it's all polyester. The only stretchy part is the elastic around the waist."
3.0,Quality & color nice but should say MINI- tote. Super tiny
3.0,I did like the idea of this dress... it's cut and style. But eturned because material is sheer. Personally would not allow my child to wear without a slip or camisole long enough to cover for the length of the dress. I expected the flowers to be a bolder but they were kinda faint. The material is similar to a baby blanket made out of thin muslin.
3.0,Nice shirt but the material is so thin it’s near see through
3.0,"The color is a bright orange/peach, the actual dress doesn’t have tassels in the chest area (as described in the picture)"
3.0,I fit an L/XL so I went on the bigger side. Shorts are so cute but unfortunately they are entirely too small and there's no option for an exchange or return. So be skeptical when ordering
3.0,"Delivery arrived as expected. Shoes look used instead of new. Scuff marks under bottom of shoes, tear in fabric inside of shoe and one of the heels did not look right. Disappointed!"
3.0,The watch loses about a minute or so every few days. I just reset it. The date is never correct.  It is okay for the price I paid. This is my &#34;work&#34; watch.
3.0,Worked great for the virtual 20s/30s event I attended. Would not have like if in person. Too cheap.
3.0,Not as comfortable as described.
3.0,"Have other ASICS low cut socks and love them.  Wanted black and ordered these.  They are VERY thin - thinner than my others.  So thin you feel the weave.  Also, lower than low cut - almost a now show.  Not what I expected.  However, if you want a very thin almost no show sock, these are for you."
3.0,"I loved this necklace but after wearing twice, the chain started turning color. Now it's a almost black chain w/ pretty white teardrops...not cute at all! I'm thinking of switching out the chain myself. I know you get what you pay for but I've gotten other necklaces before and they didn't turned as quickly as this one did. It's a shame because it's really cute."
3.0,"Although the description says they are for women, they are extremely too small for a woman's ear.  I purchased them as a gift for my adult daughter.  They were entirely too small, so I gave them to my 5 year old niece instead.  They are very pretty, just too small."
3.0,But a little weak mine lasted 2 weeks on vacation before the nose piece broke but for 99 penny's it is worth it . If it was more expensive then that's a different story.
3.0,"A lot prettier online. This one has a lot more yellow gold than expected, but still very pretty."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ccb6600701e65f95c41cbb65fc00dd31]] Love this coat, too bad it is extremely big. I ordered a small size and it looks as if I’m going to drown in this coat. Besides the incorrect sizing and not having actual pockets this would have been a win."
3.0,"They were nice, but the sizing ran very small, notably around the thighs (but I've got more muscular legs). Basically they fit like skinny jeans which I hate, so if you're in to that sort of style...go to town!"
3.0,Material is nice. Runs small up top
3.0,a bit short to wear with my work id
3.0,I am very happy with this purchase. I might order it in a different color. I bought it for dressing up but it also looks cute with jeans.
3.0,"Very thin, lightweight material. The visor is extremely large and a bit goofy looking.  My boyfriend laughed at it so I haven't worn it in public yet - maybe best for gardening solo..."
3.0,"Beautiful, but not meant for larger calves."
3.0,The chain broke after wearing for a few weeks.
3.0,It fit a lot smaller than expected
3.0,"Great fit, pretty dress...but the material snags very easily and has the appearance of pantyhose that is pulled up or has runs in it when it does. I got exactly 3 hours of wear out of this dress."
3.0,Way way too small - I think these are meant for kids not adults? They were cute though.
3.0,"I like it, but the leather smells moldy. Any way I can get a replacement?"
3.0,Runs small but very warm
3.0,Cute last minute look but definitely order up. There is no stretch at all
3.0,It was not as good quality or as small as I thought it would be. But it came on time
3.0,"I purchased the red agate, lapis and onyx. I am happy enough with the bead selection, but they are strung to tightly and I am sure they will break quickly. The onyx is especially tight. For the price though, I can restring them with elastic and not be mad about it."
3.0,Nice looking cross.  I don't care for the black PLASTIC on it tho.  wish they would of made that clear in the advertisement.
3.0,They was starting to wear down and tear within the first month.
3.0,"The earrings are really cute, but if you have fat earlobes these are not for you. They are tiny and would be more like for a child,"
3.0,The pin removal tool was not strong enough to remove the pins. I spent 4 hours trying to remove four pins because I have a small wrist. I was only able to remove one pin.  I'm taking brake until I can find a mechanical watch pin removal device.
3.0,Very nice quality but a little loose on feet doesn't feel secure enough.
3.0,"I received this item at a discount and I bought a gray XXL(US 14) because my bust size is a bit larger than most and I didn't want it to be too snug. It was still a bit small/snug in the bust and surprisingly snug further down instead of flowy like the picture. I normally wear around a size medium/large depending on the bust size of shirts. While this shirt doesn't look awful on me, I can see how it wouldn't be quite right for others who see the picture and expect it to be a bit on the loose/baggy side. It is made of good fabric though, washes nicely and didn't shrink on me. I'm not sure if it has specific washing instructions but I always do cold water wash and low heat dry for most clothes. Overall it is a good quality shirt just make sure you do your measuring based on the size charts in the picture before purchase."
3.0,I'm not a big guy and the size large glove is not big enough.
3.0,"These Cycling Bike Shoe Cover only lasted one season.  They help to keep your feet warm when riding in the winter but are not waterproof, so if you get caught in the rain or snow, they will get wet and your toes will be wet too.  Last year was the first year that I rode though the winter, so I don't know if the shoe should last for more that one season, but I think that they should.  The bottom part of the shoe cover also wore out as I walk on them every time I got on and off the bike.  I expected more."
3.0,"i am 5'10"" 198lbs and i ordered a large. i wear large t-shirts and most of my other sweaters are larges. this sweater fit me like it's an extra large. it works but is far from fitting properly. It's loose but fine around the chest and the sleeves are too long and drape over my hands. the sweater is comfy and i love the colour and pattern. but one other grievance i have is that its only been a week or two and there is already fraying at the ends of the sleeves and every little scrap of lint is sticking to the zipper seem. it doesn't maintain a sharp look for long without constantly fussing over it."
3.0,"It's a roomy shirt and very cute, but its rather clingy.  Also it appears to be longer in the picture than it actually is...at least in my opinion.  I like it though!"
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful I love the colors, my complaint is that it came VERY poorly restrung, there is thread coming out all over the place! Also the necklace is knotted however, it is not tight AT ALL the beads move up and down very freely.  I'm just gonna cut it down and make my own."
3.0,Top was cute but an extra large should be remarked a small!
3.0,Very stiff!
3.0,Not as pictured! Didn’t come with sweet message which is why I bought it for my best friend. I was disappointed when she opened it.
3.0,"The material is beautiful, but the length of this romper goes down to my knees and is super loose and makes you look frumpy. I'm 5'2 110 lb got a size small."
3.0,Nice and cute. My only complaint is that the sandal is made with less durable material. I will only use for special occasions.
3.0,"Card slots are a little snug. Maybe it needs broke in a bit,  like a new pair of shoes. I was disappointed that there is no pen holder. Other than that it seems fairly sturdy."
3.0,Ordered a little bigger than my size but the elastic band is super small. The whole thing fits better now that I removed the elastic. I wouldn’t buy another. It’s thin and flimsy.
3.0,The material is thin
3.0,"Pretty lame gloves. Better to spend $20-$35 on some really warm, nice leather gloves if you can afford to do so,"
3.0,Bought a pair for each of my daughters and they complained that the shoes hurt their feet. My youngest got a blister. Cute but not good to wear if they will be doing a lot of walking.
3.0,More heart shapes than I would like
3.0,"I rushed through my purchase when I got this, and sadly didn't realize until it arrived that it was not hooked up to a battery power. I had to purchase a power bank separately (and those are pretty heavy to have to carry around with you.) Once I received the power bank and hooked this up, it worked good. I like how it keeps me warm when I'm outside especially in the rain and wind.  I don't like how the heat is only in certain spots so only certain parts of my body are being warmed. I usually wear this with another zip up hoodie over this one and it seems to work fine."
3.0,"I really liked this jumpsuit style and material. Only problem was the sizing. The small was so big, it was more like a large."
3.0,"These are alright, barely big enough for my size 10 foot."
3.0,"Be forewarned, this is not flattering! Ordered as part of a costume and it served its purpose but it shows everything and then some."
3.0,"This shirt is really cute, but runs super small. I wear a missed XL.  The 2X was very tight, I've reordered in the 3x hoping it fits."
3.0,I can make an adjustment but i like it.
3.0,"Good product, very fashionable. But the arms are way too short. They don't fit comfortably."
3.0,It was pretty but the sleeves fit awkwardly. Good for all sizes but recommend fit smaller sizes
3.0,"Beautiful, well made but sizing is off and found it to be a bit small.  So unhappy and not wanting to go through hoops to get a replacement or refund.  A bit unhappy."
3.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend. It wasn't what we expected but it did the job. They didn't like the material and a few of the dots on the hat fell off after a day of wearing.
3.0,I followed the sizing chart listed by the company. The tanks were too large.
3.0,"These black glitter ballet flats are adorable. They have padding inside. They fit true to size in my daughter’s usual size 11. They look cute dressed up or down. Here is the problem, the glitter comes off! Like everywhere! Ugh! I can’t believe nobody else in the reviews mentioned this, or not that I read at least. I assume the black pair listed that is non-glitter won’t have this issue. It’s a shame because the black glitter is so cute and my daughter will still wear them but I can’t stand glitter that falls off everywhere. If you pick them up in your hands to move them you have black glitter all over your hands. It says on the box they are machine washable but I’m guessing if I machine wash them the glitter will come off. We may try washing them after she wears them with her Christmas dress to see if that helps with the glitter falling off everywhere. My daughter loves them and Ive actually contemplated ordering the other black color listed that isn’t glitter for her. I would have exchanged them for that pair but we needed them for a party. It’s very unlike Skechers to have a pair of shoes with glitter that falls off. All my kids have Skechers and they are normally great quality. Otherwise they are cute shoes if you can deal with the glitter. I gave 3 stars for cuteness.<br />Update: I hand washed them with detergent and the excess glitter came off. It fixed the glitter coming off everywhere. The shoes are still glittery (only the extra glitter came off) and still cute after washing. So it ended up working out ok. My daughter loves them."
3.0,"I bought this for my child for his birthday but it's going to be a while before he can actually wear it. I got thr smallest youth size they had and it fits more like a medium or a large rather than a small. His brother, who is 3 years older, can wear it perfectly though."
3.0,Recommended to go up many Sizes and I'm 5'4 127 lbs and the pants are an XXL fit!!. The jacket fits like an XL. The fabric is great the size is off. I did find a medium men's from the same company and it's a great fit.
3.0,"They look warm and feel warm at first, but after 10-min outside in temperatures below 30 F, the cold starts to seep in.  I expected more for $30 gloves."
3.0,"What I got was not what is pictured, although we decided to keep them. The chain running down the center looks the same. But instead of tapered cups I got flowers with an antiqued coppery finish. They are very pretty."
3.0,"Ive used brooks for marathons for the past 2 years. Decided to give launch a try but unfortunately got dissapointed as soon as i put them on. Defenitey not for running long distance, currently only using it for the gym and cross training."
3.0,Cute hat but the button fell off after 2 days
3.0,~~Boots are really Bucky!!!!ww
3.0,Kind of cheap looking...
3.0,wouldve been amazing if i got it in the correct size. dont listen to these reviews above if you are very athletic and lean. get a size smaller
3.0,"have bought 2 of these, yes they are itchy in the back, i wear them about 4 hours a day, they do instantly help your posture, big problem is the quality, both are unraveling, especially at the v neck, i question how long they will last"
3.0,"I love the feel of the material, I love the style of the dress, but my daughter wore it one time and we didn’t even wash it yet… And the hem completely fell out and all of the hem around the sleeves fell out."
3.0,Still bothers my ear for it to be hypoallergenic but it's still cute.
3.0,Do not like the material but it fits fine.
3.0,Had to return these tanks are way too large
3.0,"For the price, can’t complain too much! But, it’s a very cheap material IMO and isn’t comfortable. It matches a harness I own so that’s a plus and why I bought it to begin with! For everyday use, no way."
3.0,"In the picture, the color is more like a pastel pink/blush.. it is almost Fuchsia!<br />The piece in general is nice, the color was a disappointment."
3.0,"The quality is nice for the price, but the earrings arrived larger than expected.  Easy return/credit policy."
3.0,"My head gets cold during the winter, so I purchased these for sleeping caps. They slide off before I go to sleep. I tried wearing them during the day, but they don’t stretch very well and slide up. They are nice colors and seem to be well enough made, just small.<br />They are going to get donated to a shelter for small women and children."
3.0,"I recently went snowboarding and bought these gloves a few weeks prior to the trip. I was very excited to try these out but at the end of a few runs and maybe 2-3 hours of falling and getting up, my gloves were already soaked. So soaked that it pruned my fingers through the gloves :( Although it was not waterproof, it did keep my hands warm when it wasn’t wet. But I would still be aware :)"
3.0,Material is rough. Not well made. Totally disappointed.
3.0,On me they are baggy around my ankles. Admittedly I do have small feet and ankles for my height. They fit more like normal hiking socks. I wouldn’t consider them compression.
3.0,"Nice but i expected something different, i shouldnt have though since the price was so low. The top part is loose, so wear with a jacket and the material is quite thin so wear with shorts underneath I’d say"
3.0,"Has a lot of push-up bra padding.  Not necessarily a good mom suit if you are playing with and picking up kiddos a lot.  Pretty suit, good for those willing to<br />Show lots of cleavage"
3.0,No está bien echo
3.0,"I bought these in grey, black, and jade. Love the color of the jade. Fits as expected. Quality is ok. Good value. They stretch out a little as the day  goes on."
3.0,I had to return because the large was too small . I’m 5’9 170. I’m gonna reorder and get an XL.
3.0,The description states STAMPED 14K HGE this necklace is pretty but NOT STAMPED AS stated in description!  :/
3.0,"Wishing the straps were more adjustable. I ordered an extra large size and it still feels tight. Perhaps it will give a bit with wear since it is not as comfortable as I was hoping it would be. Nothing is harder than to find the right bra since all body types are different; seems it comes down to searching, searching, and more searching."
3.0,"I will start off by saying I am abusive to boots.  I have a working farm in clay mud and if I get a summer out of boots they are pretty good.  I got these the end of May and the end of August I had the heel cracked and leaking.  I paid around $13, so I can't complain.  They are cute, they didn't feel bad after I put insoles in them and they rinsed off well, the tread was easy enough to wash off.  I'll probably get them again for next year.  They can't compare to Mucks, but for $13 I felt I got my money's worth."
3.0,"This was at the TOP of my Christmas list, and I was THRILLED when I opened to find I had received these. They are so soft and adorable. The down size is they are TOO BIG. They do not stay up as shown in the picture."
3.0,Too small watch and and unable to find extra links anywhere to buy
3.0,"Winder was fine, but would not fit my watch."
3.0,"Very pretty, but if you are large chested, this suit will not provide the support for your chest. It will not support the weight and will hang really low and show lots of cleavage. I could look cute in it,  but not for swimming."
3.0,Super small.  I got a sz L and they are the sz of a small.
3.0,"Like clockwork, the band just broke in the middle of the night at about 2 years of wear. I keep it simple and never take it off except when going into a swimming pool in the summer. I don't take baths, just quick showers. It's not worth replacing the band so I just buy another one. (It's amazing, I wrote this 2 years ago but it was never sent.  I have just had the same 22 month break of the band again and got another one in 1 day.  Thank you Amazon.)"
3.0,"Very pretty, fits well but it is too long (2 inches). Goes way over the knuckle. I returned it."
3.0,I followed the sizing chart and the bottoms which should almost be too big are almost too small. It's is described as push up and it definitely is just a wire bra like top.. I buy push up because I have broad shoulders and a wide breast plate so I need it. Was a little bummed that it's not really. But it still looks really cute.
3.0,Stitching inside one pocket was not finished creating a hole in the pocket. Large was a perfect fit for golfing.
3.0,"Any fellow portal fan will get it, and they look really cute. Unfortunately they are not of the highest quality and eventually the colour chips. If you really like them though, you can wear them until they fall apart and then order a new pair for this reasonable price. I'd also caution you when wearing them to bend the upper wire (the part that goes through your ear) closed so it sits snugly on your earlobe, as these wires are very thin and the earrings will slip out if you're not careful."
3.0,Phone doesn’t fit well
3.0,The colors of these earrings are very nice! Buuut the fringe isn’t cut even and some of the tassels are pretty stiff. I wouldn’t buy these again.
3.0,"It was too small, so i will have to purchase an adjustor before i can wear it."
3.0,"I initially purchased this bag as an easy travel companion to a trip to a theme park in Orlando. I looked at many different bags and eventually settled on one. Unfortunately, when I received the bag there were some challenges. I still used it but I may purchase a different bag if I took the trip again.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The bag is light weight.<br />It seems durable.<br />The bag is compact and small (If that is what you want)<br />It was comfortable on my body especially because of how light and small it was.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />The bag was way too small.<br />You cannot fit much inside - my intention was to fit my iPad, a Sony camera with a couple lenses, my wallet and maybe a water bottle. I perhaps underestimated the size but 9.7 and above tablet cannot fit. The camera and lenses (Sony) do but with not much room left for water, or a poncho<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The bag itself is fine but be careful to judge the size you want and the items you will want to put in it because this one was too small for my needs. Perhaps this is more my fault but I was left disappointed by that.<br /><br />If you want a bag just to put your wallet, phone and maybe a small water bottle it will be fine, but not much else."
3.0,"Material is a bit thin, but they are comfortable."
3.0,It’s a great amount but they crack easily and all plastic. I still use a few but it’s not too good of quality
3.0,"We  had a Cami similar to these. The ones we have have the ribbed lining at the top, as shown in the image.  However, the ones we received did not have that, so we notice that they were different.  We didn't say anything but our daughter notice that they were not nearly as soft as the ones she had before. We noticed that the ones we received word from Mexico as opposed to the original ones, which are from Thailand.  Both of them are 100% cotton. But the ones from Thailand are noticeably softer to the touch."
3.0,"This watch helps to learn to self-monitor your time on each section of the LSAT.  It is clear, large and easy to read.  It is also colorful, which-- we will take any excitement we can get when reading about the evolution theory of neutrine osmosis by infusion :)  My only complaint, and it's a big one-- is that the stem of the watch is hard to grasp (even harder to grasp than the stem of some of the test questions)!  A lot of stopping and starting is required for completing timed sections.  This is the purpose of the watch!  It should be easier to set and stop. It probably would help if I had longer fingernails, but anxiety over this test has resulted in chewing them down."
3.0,It's beautiful and well made but make sure you buy one two sizes bigger
3.0,"When it comes to buying socks its all about the size.  I wear a size 14 shoe.  I have trouble finding socks like these that are truly for large feet.  The sizing chart show that ""Large"" is for size 12 - 14.  It did not show XL in size chart, but it was available to add to cart.  When I received the socks they say XL in the band.  I was barely able to get them on.  If it wasn't for the size problem I would have rated a 5."
3.0,The necklace is very pretty but it tangles up around my neck alot. Kind of a pain to wear because it just starts eventually choking me the longer I wear.
3.0,Thought they we cotton to use in a quilt but instead made masks
3.0,too big and gacky
3.0,It fits a little small. Tight around the shoulders and wrist. When ordering you may want to consider one size bigger
3.0,These are just too short to even close up easily. Use them but weren’t as great as I hoped for when ordered.
3.0,"Cute pattern, would love it, but shoulders are TIGHT! fits great everywhere else"
3.0,So cute but poorly made. The seams are already tearing after one wear.
3.0,Threads coming apart after 1 wash
3.0,"For the first time wore my venena jacket today, and see what others buyers meant about missing snaps. As you see in my pic my jacket came with a missing one. For this reason only three stars."
3.0,"It is very cute, but they are short. It looks really weird when i wear them."
3.0,"Quality is not bad, but it’s extremely baggy and loose."
3.0,Did not have a forehead sweatband like the last ones I purchased for the same price.  Threads hanging and coming out all over.  Said I was made in China for a quarter all over them !!!
3.0,"These are exactly what we were looking for, as our daughter's one Christmas request is &#34;sparkly goggles.&#34; I think they are a little expensive, and in any other situation we would not pay this much for this product."
3.0,Cute sandals but they were small and I ordered a size up....
3.0,"Watch works good, and arrived in a neat box ready to go.  Watch face is a nice looking bronze, but I was under the impression that the watch case was not painted black.  Band is very comfortable though."
3.0,"I’m 5,6” and they’re too long. I can still wear them by folding the waistband down, which I’ll do because they’re very comfortable. They’re NOT joggers. Straight leg. They look like pajama pants. The black on gray, looks like black on dark purple. Still looks good, though. I’ll wear them. Just not sure what shoes will look right. Hmm."
3.0,"The two colored bars/balls are exactly as I expected them. The sword came in broken. I thought the pointed end would screw on/off, but the hilt came off instead and it will not screw back on. It just spins and spins. I was really bummed, too, because that is the piece I really wanted."
3.0,Not as tailored as the picture.
3.0,Size is totally off. I order XL for comfort she’d it was TOO small! Returned today for a refund.
3.0,extremely dark sun glasses even when sunny i can barely see so if that is what you are looking for then these are great. Besides that they are exactly what you expect for the price. A little smaller than i thought.
3.0,"I have only one complaint about this jacket. Unfortunately for me, it's a big one. The closures on the wrists are plastic not cloth. They're rigid which means they constantly catch on things and I'm having to adjust them way too frequently. They don't grip the velcro tightly enough to stay put. I don't know of a solution and don't sew, so ....maybe duct tape? Just kidding. I do love the colors and the fit. Something else I'd like is a chest, arm, or internal pocket. It is a flattering cut."
3.0,"Runs small and a lighter weight band around waist would be softer, I have a bad back"
3.0,I was so excited to receive these unfortunately they are all super small and only fit my 16 year old daughter she loves them though just wish sizes would have been listed
3.0,"Mask is sewn below the nose so special filter can't go in. Sadly, I can't use these with filter which defeats the purpose."
3.0,"Great while it lasted...which was only about 30 days. Snapped at the back seam, even with cold wash and hang to dry."
3.0,"Got this in a Small & it fits good . The only problem is that I thought it could withstand being in the rain . When I take it off , my clothes are damp . Other than that , no complaints ."
3.0,"The Bohemian handmade wood bangles arrived in perfect condition. They come in a pretty sheer bag which makes them perfect for gift giving. I received the red bangles with no paint chippings or dullness. They appeared just as pictured shiny & bold in red. Keep in mind these bangles are for petite wrists only, they will not fit big boned or larger wrists. These are definitely statement pieices due to the unique design shapes however they appear to be a tad uncomfortable to wear long term, would be much more suitable for a night out or a quick brunch. Overall they appear in good quality & durable. Wish they would come in a variety of sizes though as humans aren't a one size fits all."
3.0,THE PANTS FIT OK..  BUT THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO LACE THE PANTS YOURSELF.  AND IT ALOT OF HOLES.<br />BUT THEY ARE SEXY....
3.0,"the lenses are not overly dark, but my daughter who I purchased this for loves them.  It reminds her of a minecraft version of sunglasses.  I just wish the lenses were darker to protect her eyes while outside"
3.0,These slipper fit snug and fell great in the beginning.  Then after a few weeks the foam insole lose its shape and totally flattens out.
3.0,I was not expecting these earrings to be so small. I have a hard time holding them to place them in my ears. The backs are made of plastic and don't seem to fit on the posts well.
3.0,I should have ordered a bigger size because this hugged me in all of the wrong places. The material and construction were very nice but this is not my style.
3.0,I had hoped for a thicker material..
3.0,not my style when I put it on
3.0,"They're cute, but look better in the picture."
3.0,too hard to set in jacket and put on correctly.  post seems a little short.
3.0,This item came earlier than expected and in great packaging how it fit awkwardly. I ordered a size up and it's still somewhat small.
3.0,Somewhat baggy and thin material. Random Loose threads. Holds up good and looks cute.
3.0,Not my favorite. They fit too loosely. I bought the appropriate size (smaller would be too small in waist and length) and they were much too loose to wear as a base layer. They need to fit more like leggings. I felt like I was wearing long johns.
3.0,Cute but stretched out in a half days wear Not sure if I will be keeping them.
3.0,Runs smaller than advertised. Might want to consider ordering a size larger than usual.
3.0,It was a cute hat but runs small.  Made the top of my head look small
3.0,Didn't care for this
3.0,The bottom is pleated and doesn't lie down right. Kind of bells out. We took it in a bit on the skirt and it fits perfect.
3.0,"i'm not a 2, yet, i had to have it altered"
3.0,size could could be a bit larger a bit too tight- needs more stretch
3.0,Very cute but fits very bulky
3.0,"beautiful piece, but it broke in two. that's about all I can say to fulfill my 15 word requirement - bummer"
3.0,I would suggest to size up one.
3.0,"I like how they look but I’ve worn the glasses a few times & now they are so wide i can keep them up. I usually wear more expensive glasses but wanted to try something more trendy. Not sure why they grew but I will be returning. After taking the photo, it doesn’t seem to make my point, but trust me they’re big."
3.0,"You get what you pay for - very thin, slides off foot easily. I'm a size 10.5 and I've had issues with them staying on my feet. GO to Primark , Marshalls or TJX, pay an extra $2 and get something much better."
3.0,These are pretty much  the Lulu align dupe they claim to be. The do run a bit big IMO I got the medium and wished I had the small. I got the green camo. The color is a bit bright not as classy muted like the lulu but for the price comparatively it’s hard to really complain.
3.0,cute shirt but i expected a better quality
3.0,My son liked tgem so if he's happy then I'm happy.
3.0,"I ordered the pinkish color and received the bikini in a totally different color than advertised. The one I received is a more peach color than it is pink. I also do no have the band that is on the bottoms. The bikini does run small (from what I read) so I ordered a large (I am usually a M), however the picture makes it look more fitting but mine is more baggy. It’s an acceptable bikini, especially for the price, but just not what I wanted."
3.0,"I found these to be a good value but not quit the quality to give to the woman in your life.  They look good from a distance, but up close no so good.  Very tiny plastic back pieces to hold the earring on the ear.  With a minim investment these are a great gift for your daughter or grand daughter."
3.0,This ghost trap is just for looks. Item does not open up which would have been cool to put items in for storage. So it doesn't even come with pedal. Nothing is functional. You can use it for a paper weight or place on a bookshelf for looks. Only good thing is that it's sturdy and hard to break when dropped
3.0,"This watch wasn't that expensive, but I was still expecting a bit more.  The watch looked like a kids toy watch.  Disappointed."
3.0,Mediocore
3.0,"These have provided much more cushion than my running shoes were providing, but I keep getting 2 in long blisters between arch and big toe - both feet.  There doesn't seem to be anything that would cause this and it isn't the edge of the insole so not sure what is causing it.  I thought it might stop after breaking in period but it hasn't. If it keeps up, I'll have to remove them."
3.0,Cute I usually wear a medium so I ordered medium but small would be better this makes my hips look wide!
3.0,It's a bit scratchy and the double hooks in back are a little hard to handle.  It does seem to support as a no-bounce.
3.0,"I ordered my regular size, but the item is a little small."
3.0,la tela es súper diferente muy feo la verdad es muy transparente la calidad muy mala tela que engaño pero bueno uno aprende
3.0,"Print was good and what I expected. Runs small, so the XXL fit like other XL hoodies (likes them baggie).  But being polyester, it beads up quickly."
3.0,Would have given it a better rating if it hadn’t arrived missing the belt
3.0,"The fabric is soft/silly and stretchy. The reason I marked the fit as too small is because the shirt is too short. It is not long enough to tuck. I bought this for layering in winter. Instead of returning it I am wearing another longer tank under it. I tuck that in and then wear this on top, but still under another sweater. This shirt would not work unless you want to expose your mid drift when you move around."
3.0,"My wife purchased these, way smaller than how it is shown in the picture."
3.0,Knobs break off after about a year. I cut the button off and use a large safety pin to clamp/ fasten the belt on. The button over time causes the button holes to tear and break. The Belt material is stiff and not very flexible. I have had other belt like this one the were more comfortable.
3.0,Wanted to love this & it had potential but mine arrived bent in several places in addition to a jagged piece of metal on the very point.
3.0,Must be pictured on a shorter model. Much shorter one than model. Over all comfortable and a cute style. Personal they more think a booth shorter on me and this style does not look good as a booth short.
3.0,"Product is made of 100% polyester. Would have been better if it was a Cotton/Polyester blend.<br />Product is made in China....quality is OK OK, not that great.....but not bad as a fashionable hoody. Not worth more than $20."
3.0,Do you not like the material
3.0,"Long sleeve, not elbow length."
3.0,It was a lot longer than I expected.  Might be good for someone who wears it with leggings. Cute design though.
3.0,Nice but lite weight... flimzy... cheap...
3.0,i love the fabric and color but little bigger than i expected.<br />the size was like a large in US
3.0,Fur was a little scratchy and I think it would just get rougher if I wash it so I returned it. I would also only get it on sale since it’s pretty small :/
3.0,I got an XL and it's snug on me. I usually wear XL tops and bottoms... material is extremely thin... I was hoping for more since i spent $20.99.... seems really cheap
3.0,I ordered a medium. I am 5’8” size 6-8 and it was too big around the waist and the flow of the dress was too much. I ordered the yellow and it is pretty. It is not s mustard yellow that I was hoping for but still pretty. I would recommend ordering a size smaller.
3.0,"Runs big, should get one size under actual size besides that I like it nice and white"
3.0,"I got a medium, im 5'2 135 lbs. Normally wear medium everything.  But this ran really small. Was hard getting it over my hips. The boob area is really small..<br />Felt like good material, but just too small.<br />The length felt too short."
3.0,"My daughter loves the gems.  It’s a little loose but still fit her.  She has narrow feet.<br />Unfortunately,  the shoes doesn’t hold up very well.  Pretty but poor quality."
3.0,"It appears to be for a child, however it was much to big. The measurements say 4.5 It was 7.34. My Granddaughter was very disappointed. Pretty bracelet though."
3.0,I am between a small and medium and lean toward the medium for “room to grow” as I still like to say. The medium was quite large on me so I returned this in favor of a more well fit dress. I suggest to err on the “size down” front
3.0,I am not sure about the dress for me.
3.0,"The back snapped off upon removal after the 2nd wear. I have jewelry glue but still, it shouldn't have."
3.0,I got this dress for Valentine’s Day for my 3 year old daughter. It was a bit short but we just put leggings under her dress . Very cute but won’t last after many washes .
3.0,"Was too large, but decided to keep it anyway because I felt that if I sent it back and got the smaller size that it may be too small.  Just rolled up a handkerchief in the inside rim of the hat and it fits nicely."
3.0,Product lasted six months with regular use. Stitching became undone. The dye also started wearing off in four to five months.
3.0,Slips off hair throughout the night
3.0,i Changed my review because they ripped. Right dow the pocket line. I don’t know if this was just a defective pair or what but I was not rough enough with them to tear like that. I was very upset. I was refunded $11 to have them fixed. It shows the seller is trying to help.
3.0,I expect a better fit and it’s made of nylon vs cloth so it move around or slip back or front of your head. It’s ok but not for me. Thanks
3.0,They run a little small. If you have medium hands they won't fit well or at all.
3.0,"it is a cute cap, but a little big, but do-able."
3.0,Cute scarf. The fabric quality was not as good of a quality or what I had expected.
3.0,It was a little bigger than I expected it to be especially after reading other peoples reviews. Also it's very floppy so a little uncomfortable for little one. But it was cute and light weight so that was a plus.
3.0,Too big and too long😩
3.0,"It's cheap and I like the look of it, but the black string faded very quickly. But for the price, it's expected."
3.0,They break the ends off to easy they could be made better
3.0,"While I love the design of this stud, the little bead on the inside wasn't big enough to keep it in my nose.  It's possible the gauge is too small for the size of my piercing but I was surprised at the complete lack of resistance holding the piercing in my nose."
3.0,Color was no where near as vibrant as in picture. More of a dusty rose and hot pink.
3.0,"The crystal is blue and very difficult to see through. I suppose if you have young eyes or perhaps wear good, strong glasses all the time, this won't be an issue for you. But I was unable to read the time as I couldn't see the hands of the watch and could only barely see the roman numerals. The other thing is that the little crystals are on the gawdy side. There's really too many of them and it makes the watch look like it's way over the top in terms of flashiness. I think some temperance in the design would have been a better choice. Maybe it's just my taste, but if you look at the picture, the crystals look toned down and not overbearing. But in real life it was a bit too much. But if that's your taste, then you might really love it."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this necklace. It looked so pretty in the ad, and it is pretty. The only problem, it doesn't lie flat. A smaller ring protrudes from the back of the knot at a right angle and holds a larger ring that the chain loops through. That smaller ring prevents the knot from laying flat against the chest. The 10-inch chain is just the right length, there is no extension, and the bottom (total 12 inches) hangs right in the cleavage. However, I find myself having to kind of adjust the knot to keep it mostly flat. Not a huge problem, but I don't think Vesper Lynd ever had to adjust hers.  I'm keeping it. It's lovely on a bare neck, or against a solid black top."
3.0,arms of the frame don't seem to be in proportion to the frame
3.0,"Survived TWO crashes! One I was going around 15mph and hit some gravel in a construction zone. The Second crash I was going around 55mph on a decreasing radius my bikes were not totaled or anything mainly the gear I was wearing. I've ridden 35k miles with these pants with 4 different bikes over 2 years. I've ridden in 15 degrees and up to 110 degrees. At first they were hold up very well. After my first crash I used black duck tape to hold the knee together (I get a lot of comments on my YouTube channel about it) This was my first motorcycle gear and it was all I could afford. I highly recommend getting Alpinestars or similar brand since it's better protection.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Inexpensive<br />Good rated armor<br />If you find riding isn't for you, then you didn't spend a lot on gear.<br />Breathes really well layer up in winter and it does a good job<br /><br />Cons:<br />You get what you pay for but for what you get in the price range is decent.<br />Fades into a purple. I ride a lot so I'm not surprised.<br />No hip protection. My right hip was bruised pretty good after my slide out."
3.0,The bird dress is cute but not the material I expected. With other dresses there is a higher quality material-less thin and more stretchy.
3.0,Returned only because they were too large.  Vision and glasses were fine.
3.0,fits a little loose but still wearable.  (size 7 3/8).  what i don't like is how &#34;poofy&#34; it is. it won't lay close to the head because of the materials and thickness of the layers.  also i washed it and one of the seams came apart.  but you get what you pay for. i  figured I'd try it for the price and got a mediocre hat.  would someone else like it? probably.  just not what i expected.  I'll keep searching for a better hat.
3.0,its more of a spandex material. I didnt like that too much
3.0,Cute but scratchy against my neck.
3.0,it does not fit my baby and I requested return still did not hear from the seller.
3.0,Product is made well but it did not flatter me at all so returned
3.0,Runs very small and short.  Had to return it.
3.0,"Smaller than expected. The name implies a sticker with the dimensions of 4x4 inches. The clear backing support is 4x4 inches, not the size of the B."
3.0,"Quality is good, but noooo way is this what I thought Bone (white) was. It is a beige/canvas color. I have to say I was shocked at the dull color compared to the photo."
3.0,"It is a cute little wristlet wallet, but after two days of using it, the strap pulled out of the wallet, apparently stitching was not good. So now the strap part is useless.  Disappointed."
3.0,"Was fine at first and then one of the magnets on one of the bracelets came out, the one bracelet didn’t last more than maybe 10 minutes"
3.0,"it's not like it's pictured, it didn't have the green and blue beads only cream. to much trouble to return and not sure if it would come correct like picture."
3.0,This boot is beautiful to wear but difficult to remove from your foot if you live alone.  I hesitate to use a boot jack because it may damage the boot skin. Any suggestions?
3.0,Wore them once and they’re already falking apart
3.0,"The material is nice.  Soft and expanding.  They are a bit snug - yet I ordered a size large to make sure they wouldn't be.  However, I can wear them and do like them.  They are REALLY long.  Usually my pants are too short.  These are almost 2 inches too long."
3.0,I like it but not as nice as the picture
3.0,"This top is pretty and well made but doesn't lay like I thought it would.  Personally, it made me look much larger than I am.  I wanted a more streamlined look.  It's probably the material causing the pleats to jut forward.  A nice top, just not for me."
3.0,"When out In the sun . I like the polarized lens , but between the nose piece there’s a gab and it lets the sun in i which they weren’t so high up off the nose . I think if closer to the face it would be better ."
3.0,Looks cool but the zippo is cheap cheap cheap and broke very soon after I gave it as a gift to my little brother for Christmas
3.0,Great all around. Except the paint coating easily and certainly scratch right off. Literally used two minutes and tons is scratches and missing paint whenever it came in contact with anything else.
3.0,I BOUGHT 5/6 BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER IS A 4 AND I WANTED IT TO BE A LITTLE BIG AND IT JUST FITS
3.0,"I like the pendent, but not the chain."
3.0,I really can't review this personally because it was a Birthday gift for a 9 yr old Girl<br />but she's happy with it and it runs OK so far.
3.0,This is not a velvet cape. Unless velvet is satin.
3.0,"Please if you have the samsung active watch, don't buy this, the color don't match,"
3.0,I really liked this bracelet until it broke 😕 had a good vibe. unfortunately it broke as I was getting out of the car so I lost most of my beads.
3.0,Buen material pero muy pequeña
3.0,"The crown isn’t firm, it lays limp on your head. It’s a matter of personal preference. But I feel unless you want the patches the hat is crap and it’s really not worth the money."
3.0,"The arms fit well, but the length is a little too short.  I don't have a long torso at all but found I really have to wear high waist pants to feel comfortable that I won't be showing skin."
3.0,"I gave this dress 3 stars because although it's beautiful and well-made, it is impossible to get over one's hips. The lace insert is tasteful, but has no give to it. My daughter has smaller hips than me, so I'll be giving her this dress. If the lace at the waist was changed to something stretchy, I would buy this dress again."
3.0,"Beanie light is very poor, actually worthless  to use, Bluetooth speakers work very well however are very bulky and hurt ears, beanie material quality is ok"
3.0,I do like this dress but not exactly like it's pictured
3.0,Little lg
3.0,Runs small and definitely can't return to China.
3.0,washed it lost black now<br /> kind of grey
3.0,"it works but is really too short for a GPS.  The cord is spiral, not straight, and had to stretch quite a bit."
3.0,"I thought this was so cute and fit nicely! I’m postpartum and it seemed like a good idea.  However, the fabric was a little thin/cheap feeling (which the dress is cheap so not surprising) and my husband said that it looked way to frumpy.  So I returned it.  I would totally buy and wear otherwise though!"
3.0,Took forever to receive & is somewhat tight. I excepted the hat to be bigger but it wasn't.
3.0,Very nice earrings but I would have to say this stem is really short could be a bit longer then I would give more stars
3.0,Broke in two weeks had to sew it myself both
3.0,The scarf is nice but it's too bulky. It wold look a lot nicer if it's too large. Overall it's okay.
3.0,"This dress didn't fit me extremely well, I think partly because the material feels stiff and made movement restricting around the arms and shoulders. I ordered the navy/red and the top layer is definitely red. Overall a nice dress, but not exactly what I was expecting, so I returned it. I think if I ordered the next size up it might be too big."
3.0,"Although it says it is genuine leather, I am still not sure about it. It just doesn't have the right feel to it.<br />Pockets were fine in size and distribution. A bit tight, yet it probably will loosen up with time.<br />It is nice to have a pen holder, which was also a bit too tight. The Staedler pen I usually travel with didn't fit.<br />I was looking to replace a document wallet I bought in Argentina. This is not it. I will continue my search."
3.0,"So the product as a product is great! I like to wear these with my 8” work boots to keep my feet and legs comfortable while I’m working all day long. I ordered 3 pairs. 1st box brand new, as ordered. 2nd box, brand new as ordered. Box 3, the pair was clearly used!!!!!! After having opened 2 boxes with a brand new product, I definitely knew something was off! One of the characteristics of this product is that they black socks which leave your ashy skin residue on them! Let me tell you folks, there’s nothing like opening up a “brand new” box of socks to find someone else’s ashy feet residue smeared on your new socks. I take care of my feet but feet can be gross! 🤮 ... anyways I’m not one to make a fuss I just threw them in the wash and went on with my life, but that is why the review got docked 2 stars or else it would have been 5 stars! .... there might be certain folks who are into “that sorta thing”, but I’m not one! Used socks are gross!"
3.0,Awesome speaker and compartment to put them in but the beanie itself is small and a little tighter than the usual beanie. Materials are great and soft though! A decent pick up.
3.0,"only complaint, it is difficult to fit folding money in, if it was 1&#34; longer, it would be great"
3.0,A little dress.Вid not fit the size
3.0,"The fabric is pleasant to wear, however looks rather inexpensive and uneven. The ornament is not always matching one side to another and stiches are off. I have bought some other dresses with this style and found this one a waste of money."
3.0,"The pants are a bit short from the waist to the rise and the hips are a bit too large compared to the waist, so the pants do not fit the back side perfectly, too much material on the hips and too tight in the crotch."
3.0,Dress was too small in the bust area.
3.0,Nice pants. I sent for a replacement because the jacket was not delivered with the pants. Will let you know how it goes
3.0,"Color is more of a grey tinted pink than shown. Nice comfortable fit however very large and sags. Rolling this bad boy also does not look pleasing, if this were in a smaller size i would have loved it, unfortunately theres only a one size fits all kind."
3.0,"Was the wrong size, a bit thick, unwieldy."
3.0,"Nice and ZRFID, but it is noisy to open and close."
3.0,"UPDATE - Even washing in cold water and hanging to dry, the purple ran into the lighter areas. Deducting a star.<br />I like my hoodies loose and slightly oversized. I am usually a size small or medium - 5'5"" 140lb and ordered a large. It fit, but was definitely not loose. Going to order an XL and hope it fits better! I ordered the plum stripe."
3.0,The skirt is beautiful but there is no way you can wear the top and bottom together. Four completely different shades of blue. Photo is a little deceiving.
3.0,"I bought 2 pairs and a lens fell off within 2 months on one pair, one for my 7y.o. son and another for 6y.o. daughter. The shades fit perfectly and were great during baseball. I will not be buying again."
3.0,there pretty big but a good cheap buy
3.0,"Love these glasses but are a little large for my head, if I look down, they fall off... or they fall off my head when they are atop... but shape, size and style are great, just frustrating when they constantly fall down my nose"
3.0,"Way too small, and I don't have super thick wrists. Probably will return. Are there sizes for grown people?"
3.0,"It's nice-looking, a great design. EXCEPT that it's way too big. I bought a small, and immediately after trying it on I gave it to a friend who normally wears a large. Hope I can find something similarly good-looking that fits."
3.0,"Have not as yet notice any difference , or perhaps I never will. Although It's a well made item, time would tell"
3.0,"The tree part came as described, but was listed as a keychain and actually sent as a necklace. I was able to fix it, but disappointed in something that would have otherwise had a 5 star rating."
3.0,They have no support and the lacing adds no support in the way of keeping your foot aligned with the sole.
3.0,"Eh, cheaply made"
3.0,"Very awkward fit. I purchased a Wallin Bros. same style and size at a brick & mortar (Amazon didn't have a size and color combination I liked, in Wallin). I'll keep the shirt at the low price and wear it for chores. I don't work for Wallin and was not paid to endorse. Two different lines, two drastically different cuts."
3.0,This dress is fine if you want a maternity dress! It pouches out in the front. I tried to figure how it could be altered but it seems impossible!
3.0,"Unfortunately anything I've put in the wash with these underwear (particularly the darker reds, blues and greys) ends up with dark streaks that I'll never be able to wash out. This is after pre-washing these underwear 3-4 times to remove excess dye."
3.0,Comfortable but see through. I bought them to cover tattoos for work but they're completely see through
3.0,"This is a nice garment - good quality and well-made.  For the right person, it might be a good choice.  As for me - I'm considering sending it back.  The quality is so good that I cannot give it a poor rating of one or two stars.  But the problems are significant enough that I cannot give it more than 3 stars.<br /><br />The actual fit is true to size.  I am a size 2x and the XXL fits me perfectly.  This surprised me because most of the reviews stated that it runs big and so I expected a looser fit.  The length is perfect on my body - I am tall and it hits me at the low-hip, covering up my butt very nicely.  But I wonder what will happen when it is washed - if it shrinks a bit, this will not be appropriate for me because it'll be too small.  As it is, I can wear this without a problem, but it doesn't have that roomy feel that I was after and if it shrinks in the wash, not sure it'll fit anymore.  Not what I expected, and if I wash it, I might not be able to return it.<br /><br />The thing I do not like is that the material is super-dense and thick and the design is unforgiving, extremely structured and not at all relaxed.  There is very little stretch and it has a mind of its own, making me fight for every movement that I make.  It is not too small - but simply too overbearing.  The result is that instead of me wearing this shirt, THIS SHIRT IS WEARING ME!!!  😳  People should never have to conform to their clothes.  Clothes should ALWAYS CONFORM TO THE PERSON.  This doesn't conform to me.<br /><br />When I put on activewear that is intended for fun and games or sports, I don't want a prim and proper silhouette.  I want a relaxed feel that gives me freedom of movement.  This shirt is really the opposite of what I expect in a sweatshirt.  I believe that casual garments should be comfortable and relaxed - not stiff and confining.  They should conform to the body of the wearer and not make you fight for each movement you make.<br /><br />It is possible that after washing, it will soften up and be a little bit easier to wear, but after I wash it, I'm not sure that it will still be returnable if it doesn’t get better.  So I'm a bit undecided whether to keep it or not.  In a lot of ways, it is a great piece of clothing, but the fatal flaws make me suspect that if I end up keeping it, then eventually it will end up at the thrift store.  So I'll probably return it and keep looking for exactly the right thing.  It is so close to my ideal sweatshirt that I'll probably go ahead and wash it in hopes of it getting soft and pliable.  But if it doesn't, I'll be stuck with a garment that I cannot use."
3.0,Runs small but are great for sleeping in
3.0,I could have sized down
3.0,Nice enough but had to return as mine did not come with the sash as pictured.
3.0,"I ordered an XL, and wow, was it huge!  So I reordered a Large and it's perfect.  I love the colors!!!"
3.0,I ordered the blue and it is a beautiful color. It is also very transparent even wearing a half bra. Planned to wear this to my step-daughters wedding. Will find a different dress. Great dress for the pool and beach!
3.0,nice looking but runs small
3.0,Love the design but as many people said the fit runs small. Order a size or two up.
3.0,"Should,have bought ones with more Cotten in them!"
3.0,This shirt fits little I'm a medium but large wasn't  enoughr
3.0,The material is a little thinner than I expected in a rugged work boot.
3.0,Not red it’s orange.
3.0,"As much fun as cardboard wings can be, it worked well for Halloween. I would say served its purpose well."
3.0,"With frame adjustment all the way out, the glasses fit too tight around my head. Need couple more inches in length of lanyard. Not sure how to fix problem?<br />It would be nice to have a lanyard option with a length, so people with big heads or want a little bit longer lanyard will accommodate their needs."
3.0,"Be aware these masks are very large, and I have a big head! They ""gather"" up and it detracts from the look."
3.0,sended me 2 sets in same of 10pcs Assorted color....should be different set..... don't like that
3.0,"Fabric is cute. Cut is cute. But I could not lift my arms in this dress, the shoulders were oddly restrictive. Must return."
3.0,A little too large for most pockets. Works best with silk/satin pocket squares.
3.0,Beautiful dress but Not true to size
3.0,Gotta be honest here ladies.  This skirt gives major wedgies.
3.0,"This raincoat wasn't as nice as they said it would be.<br />It repels most of the rain, but don't get caught in a downpour or you will get soaked.<br />It works in a pinch and a light rain."
3.0,"Not really sure if this works as good as they say, it is a liquid repellant  but my whole can only did 5 hats, 2 coats each per the directions. But I know it does offer some protection"
3.0,"I used these for sunglasses for my bridesmaids, I heat transferred images onto them.  Most worked great, but there were a few that strings ripped on."
3.0,"Cute dress, fits as expected, but it doesn’t iron well.  I have a really hard time getting the wrinkles out!"
3.0,"The earnings looked nice and stylish, but 2 pairs were received broken. It was very disappointing."
3.0,Love the color and style but you have to order 2 sizes bigger than your normal size...runs way smaller than what the size chart indicates.
3.0,"It’s comfortable, and thick material, but it is not long like on the model. I’m 5’8” and the top part is more of a princess cut and the dress ends at my calves. I still like it, but I wish it was longer"
3.0,"Definitely not a dress length. And it's not as figure-flattering as the picture suggests. Silky-feel stretchy polyester, quite baggy."
3.0,great for party favors
3.0,"I really liked this shirt and have it in two other colors. However the green is nothing like the picture. Color shown is a pretty, bright green but I received a really dark hunter green. Disappointed so I’m returning it."
3.0,I long it but it’s longer than expected
3.0,"These shoes are cute, comfortable and fit my son well (8 years old) but I’m looking for a new shoe for him and it’s only been 5 months. They are inexpensive but I still believe 5 months is not long enough for a pair of shoes to last."
3.0,Cute little ear rings for a young girl. Gave them to great granddaughters for Baptisms.
3.0,"This coin purse is 5 star in how cute it is, but one star in how small it is. You could fit only flat items in it, and not very many. If your a fan of Lilo and Stitch you'll love it, but if your wanting to actually use it that would be difficult."
3.0,"Very fun design but thin material.  I’d recommend for a few wears a year given the inexpensive price but if it weren’t a holiday design, it wouldn’t hold up for routine wear."
3.0,What's a small around the arms...but over all it was a nice dress
3.0,Not quite as good a quality as it looked. Size is right on. Took from Jan 17 ordered until March 15 to arrive. Way too long.
3.0,"While this sweatshirt is extremely cute, it is also extremely cheaply made. It fits smaller then expected. If you are going to order this, definitely go one size up. Also, there is a fake pocket on the sweatshirt which is fine because most women’s clothes have fake pockets, but the company should have at least put a bottom on the sweatshirt so it stays closed."
3.0,"So this was not what I was expecting as far as it’s super baggy! It looks like an XXX large that was cut as a medium Size crop top. It’s comfortable- as the material is soft and light. Nice for casual wear or working out. Not my cup of tea, but if this is the style you are going for than you may like. I’m 5’2. 150 lbs. Thick athletic build. Ordered a medium."
3.0,"Even though length was stated, they are smaller than picture used to advertise, so am disappointed.  If I had seen them in person, would not have purchased.  Otherwise, are pretty, but for those who like petite earrings."
3.0,It's a very cute shirt. I have worn it once for a car trip and it already has a string coming off.
3.0,Cute but runs big. I got an x- small but fits like a medium.
3.0,"This is a nice print, but it’s HUGE , meaning you can’t even tell what it is when you have it on. Just color. Not at all what I had hoped for."
3.0,"I like the material (although it's a bit thin, but not see-through), it's comfortable and it washes really well in the washing machine/dryer... But the stitching looks cheap. There are loose threads at the bottom of the cross on the front.<br />Size-wise, it runs a bit big. I'm 5'5"" and 180 lbs and got an L, and it's loose, which is how I like it.<br />I had to cut the tag because it was very itchy.<br />I mean, it's an ok tag, but not worth more than $10."
3.0,High neck and slightly sheer. You could easily see My bra through my shirt. Material feel cheap and not made to last. I wouldn't purchase it again.
3.0,"I ordered Navy & recieved Grey. My order picture is Grey, but when I click on it it takes me to where I originally ordered which is Navy. Fix the dang pictures! Disappointed!"
3.0,"They are cute! However, the material was too harsh and no kids at the birthday party wanted to wear them."
3.0,"Beautiful earrings and I got lots of compliments. Even had others order them. The post are very thin and one broke a few weeks after receiving. And I was ever so careful with them. I LOVE the earrings and would like another pair, but not if they are all that thin and will break every few weeks. Very sad :("
3.0,Recommended size is one larger than normal but they fit big on my girl that way so I would recommend ordering the size closest to your normal size unless shoes normally fit you smaller than expected.
3.0,Smallest LARGE I have ever ordered.  I am a true Medium but went for a large just in case....should have gone extra large.  Super bummed about my purchase.
3.0,"This dress is very short but also very big and revealing in the chest area. If you have a large bust and like short skirts it is perfect. Unfortunately, I am pear shaped and this dress just doesn’t work for me. The fabric is beautiful and very nice - I wish it did fit!"
3.0,"They feel amazing, but they are too heavy for my lobe. It hangs down like an earring on my lobe, especially since it's stretched out a little. I soon will get the upper lobe of my ear pierced to see if it will work, because it's way too lose on my actual lobe. Also, one of the backs of the earrings will not push into the other part. It is so frustrating. But overall, a pretty ok product, I just need to figure out how to fix that earring."
3.0,"Doesn't hold magnetism, have only worn it a couple weeks and comes apart"
3.0,These were ok. It worked but they were pretty cheap. Better off getting ones at the dollar store.
3.0,Don't fall for the picture. This is so long it's more of a dress with pockets. The fabric is not your usual clingy soft material. This is jersey thick fabric. Suitable for winter cause it's on the heavy side. The neckline is not as the picture either. I was going to return it but I keep ordering this style and they keep sending the wrong one. Sleeves are very long too.
3.0,Ok Fit. Good packaging. Fast shipping. I just don't care for the material. Every strand of hair gets embedded into the fabric. Then it clings a lot as you walk. I'm 5'3 and it goes very well below my knees. Got a large because of my bust size (36 D) and it's still a lil snug. The rest of the dress drapes over me.
3.0,I needed some water shoes for our upcoming vacation and thought these breathable water shoes would be perfect. My daughter wears a 10.5 and that's the size I selected. The shoes kept slipping off of her feet. Perhaps the 10 or even a 9.5 would have fit better but I returned them and bought them elsewhere.
3.0,Cheap but okay.
3.0,I use this puck with my iPhone 6 Plus. If you use this with a tablet you're going to have to lay it on its side. I find that if you lay your tablet on its end it has a tendency to tip over. And by the way this is not an actual hockey puck. It's probably half the weight of an actual puck.
3.0,"The picture makes the leaves look thicker than they really are. The leaves are quite thin, which I actually think makes them look nicer.<br /><br />Update: the strand tarnishes quickly (over a few months I wore it less than 5 times and the necklace is turning brown) and the leaves were thin enough to bend out of shape. It is cheap but it doesn't last without a little tlc for more than a couple months."
3.0,An ok fit
3.0,the jacket was really nice accept for the picture...it was very blurry but from far away it looked fine
3.0,okay...
3.0,"I love this and by material and look it deserves 5 stars but it is not made for women with large breasts, it fits everywhere else beautifully but it barely covers my ****les."
3.0,"The chain is nice looking and seems durable, though it's a good thing there was an extra set of holders, since the<br />first one has already broken and it's been used on  about 2 weeks.  I wish there had been more than 2 included<br />if this is going to be the norm."
3.0,Pretty but very hard to fasten.
3.0,"Nice looking shirt, but way smaller than expected! I usually wear a large -- so that's what I ordered.  It looked minature right out of the package. My son usually wears a small or medium depending on the brand. I gave it to him, but it barely fits.  It's a nice shirt, but order at least one size up -- probably two sizes beigger than you normally would. I think I'd need an XXL for this to stand a chance. Can't imagine what will happen after a wash."
3.0,The shoes worked fine.  The baby couldn't pull them off which is good.  They were a little difficult to put on.
3.0,"I like the belt overall. The color matched perfectly with the gray shoes I bought, which was awesome. I like the way it looks and I like the ratchet feature. The only thing that sucked was one of the little pins fell out of the buckle after wearing it only a handful of times and the pin is essential for it’s function lol. I improvised by super gluing a little nail in place of the pin, which has worked so far, but I think it interfered with how smooth it was to secure the belt."
3.0,Its a nice shirt but shorter then it is in the picture. It also shrunk when washed. Other then that its pretty.
3.0,"The dress is cute, but it's completely see thru<br />. It's not such a big deal if you are ok with wearing a slip underneath it but it's extremely thin. I can still use it as a bathing suit cover up though. Fits true to size."
3.0,Fits as advertised.  Okay-ish screen print
3.0,"It was too small and also was way too long. The color and style were perfect.and it arrived early. But the pleats would be too troublesome to alter both the hemline and, especially, the waist."
3.0,The quality is fine.  I just feel like the band was dwarfed by the watch and I have the 38mm watch.  It's just a matter of preference.
3.0,So sheer you must wear a tank under it. not at all what was expected.  Almost like a pool cover up. Super thin and disappointing.
3.0,"First pair came in scratched out of the box. Returned and purchased a second pair. Now after 1 week of owning these, they are scratched too. Have gotten countless compliments on the look till I tell them the lenses scratch so easily. For $100+ I'd expect better quality."
3.0,Not the same quality or same material as the white ones I bought a while back. These do not seem as durable. We’ll see.
3.0,The mask suppose to come with gloves it didn’t false advertising
3.0,I purchased this for one of my co workers and I wasn’t impressed. The words on the key chain are not dark enough for people to actually read.
3.0,They're cute but they turn green quick
3.0,The chiffon material was not quite what I’d expected. I ordered a green one and it was very different. Still cute and a good color though.
3.0,It’s practically see through
3.0,"My second time ordering. The first was fine with no issues, but the second batch was awful.  Of the 6 in the order, 4 of them were defective. They came apart at the seams while wearing them. No third order for me."
3.0,I wear a size 9 1/2 I got a 10 in these and they fit like a 9. Returning these.
3.0,"Bought it for work, it's spacious. I expected it to be glossy it's not. It appears to be of a strong material"
3.0,"Not really a complaint since they fit fine, but I was expecting more of a combat feel to them, and based off the image you can't really tell but they have more of a slack feel if slacks came with cargo pockets."
3.0,I am a little  disappointed I bought 2 other necklaces like this from another company and they where so shiny and well made this one came in and  although its still cute it is not as well made and it is not shiny. my sister still liked it but I was expecting something different
3.0,I love the pattern and material but the one size fits all was not true. I wear a size 10 in womens and it didnt completwly wrap around me.
3.0,"They're ok, but the ear pieces are not that long and dont wanna stay on when bending over. Makes it difficult to work on things like that."
3.0,Just as advertised.  Good for yard work or painting.
3.0,THEY are ok
3.0,"It is sturdy but too narrow in my opinion to be worn by men.  It works, it's solid... but I wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,Cute - but too small
3.0,Strap is definitely soft but the buckle doesn't hold and keep a sliding.  Disappointed.  Have to purchase another one
3.0,"I love the cut, fabric and look.  After reading the reviews, I purchased 'brick red' and hoped it would work out...this item is more a burnt orange than 'brick'; a major disappointment"
3.0,"I expected these bands to be thicker terrycloth material. They are really thin. The colors are vibrant, and I really like them, just no where near as thick as I thought they would be. I bought them as a costume so they are perfect for what I need."
3.0,These are very heavy on the ear!!
3.0,"a little heavy to fit comfortably on my ear it is well made and intricately decorated, I would recommend this lovely piece of jewelry."
3.0,"Quality is great but fit is ridiculous, my son just turned two and he's like 50th percentile in size, couldn't get his little hands into this. Sad to return..."
3.0,This is a decent item. I like the idea of it and it will work just fine... but it’s not the most impressive thing I’ve ever come across. The material is that of a drop cloth used for painting a house and the off white color of one too. The print is cleanly done and clearly visible. It will suffice for now.
3.0,"Shipped on time. This hat feels like it has cardboard in it and it rubs up against my forehead so I don't wear it for too long. Cheap material but you get what you pay for, overall It's decent."
3.0,Fell apart after I tried it on. I knew the price was low and you get what you pay for but I was expecting it to last longer than taking out of the package and trying it on.
3.0,The material is very comfortable but is a little thin.  As soon as I tried it on I discovered a hole in the right pocket.  I will keep it because of comfort but disappointed a little.  I do like the placement of the pockets.
3.0,"I'm currently a 40A.  Finding a bra in that size that fits shallow breasts has become the Impossible Dream.  This bra is wearable and doesn't gap horribly, it's a good price, but it has enough shortcomings that I will not buy another one.<br /><br />The straps are too short to cross in the back, which is what I wanted, because my shoulders slope and consequently my bra straps fall down.  I wouldn't want to wear it as a strapless bra because it doesn't have any extra stiffening or gripper elastic at the sides.  It's also so stretchy that I develop quad boobs--the bra slips up when I raise my arms and it stays there.  And it has a small sewing flaw."
3.0,The pants are not stretchy fit like those in the advert snd there are two small holes where the design is on the inner leg of the pants. Its a regular jogging suit 🤷🏽‍♀️
3.0,"It actually quite a wide fit, which doesn’t help much for arch support. But it is a comfortable pair of slippers to wear around the house."
3.0,"My daughter loves this. It has actcualy stopped her asking to get her ear pierce.. other than the traditional piercings she has had since she was little. Fits a little big, but she has found a way to make it work."
3.0,"Cheap, lower quality. Useless if you want to use it as a professional server. Great if you want to dress up as a waitress for Halloween or something."
3.0,"This seems to be a nice enough dress, but the medium seems a bit large and has a boxy fit.  It's quite high-waisted, which serves to make you look dumpy.  Also, the armholes tend to gape. It's going to be comfortable enough to wear as a casual summer dress for running around, and I do love the pockets, but it's not real flattering."
3.0,"Shirt is soft, fit is large. A women's small is more like a men's small. It's not a women's fit. I like the design, so I am going to try to shrink it."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:926c8f610be74f74357363f1e2a7738d]] I’ve taken out as many links as possible and it’s still too big.  If I take out one more it cannot be clasped closed. Beautiful bracelet band, just still too big for me…🥴"
3.0,"Just the right size for a small clip.  The clasp doesn't have the strongest spring, so I wouldn't rely on these 100%."
3.0,The size runs small so I don't think  it is sized right but the ring is nice
3.0,This shirt is huge! I ordered my regular size and it was like a boxy tent on me. Not flattering at all.
3.0,"These are way smaller than they look online.  The print and quality are nice.  However, you have to put them on backwards.  And because they are so small that ends up being rather difficult.  Kind of disappointing honestly."
3.0,Thicker than it looks on the pic. Did not expect that
3.0,"Nice quality, but was worn n dirty when received."
3.0,Link pin fell out of the watch band.  Replaced it but that does not hold.  Have ordered larger size link pin.
3.0,"When I opened this It really was so stinky. it almost took my breath away. It doesn't go away. It feels like a tire not leather. The antique silver buckle , looked more like old plumbing pipe material. Just really cheap all the way around. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
3.0,"The price is right. But like others have said, the inside &#34;fluff&#34; does fall out. It can be aggravating."
3.0,The dress fits really nice but I am very upset. I bought this dress to wear to a very special birthday party and when I received it the dress was torn. I had to get a seamstress yo fix it for me. The hassle of having to fix something you just bought is not very satisfying. I also ordered this dress in the black and was gonna order it in the pink but I think I’m ok. Can’t buy something to fix it. Oh and I bought a small in the red and a Medium in the black. The red looks and fits better.
3.0,Way too small. Won't fit any boot larger than a men's 8. The quality is the best just way way tooooooo small.
3.0,They are cute but need to lose 10 lbs to fit them comfortably.  I wear a 10. Fits like an 8.
3.0,"I didn't read description well enough. They are cute bought for gift person liked them. However not like cotton sock more ""slippery"" material."
3.0,Good Quality product with comfortable feeling when wearing but for a size 11foot it didn't fit me perfectly.
3.0,The clasp? that holds the cross to the chain is REALLY cheesy
3.0,"Okay, these boots are great... Once you get the right size. All the reviews were saying, &#34;Size up one or two sizes because these run soooo small.&#34; Guess what? They were right. The description online said that the boots are now the right size and you don't have to listen to the reviews because they corrected a mistake. They did NOT correct the mistake. They were way too small. I normally wear an 8 1/2, and I ordered a 9. It was so small. We had to pay $15 (almost as much as the cost of the boots!) to ship the boots back and exchange for a 10. They're comfortable and nice once you actually get the right size... But the description is so wrong."
3.0,It’s a really nice bag but it’s not hold up to the where in tear of my daily work routine that I need for I’ve ended up having to re-stitch the sides and seams a couple times already but thankfully I own a sewing machine and that wasn’t hard and I can still use it.
3.0,"The gray and pink is really coral and pink. I wanted pink hues, not orange hues. :(  Otherwise, they are nice. I will keep them - just disappointed and feel ""pink"" is a very inaccurate description of the color."
3.0,"The description and the photo are not as received. The description says assorted colors. I wouldn't call 2 black and 2 gray - assorted!! Also, they are shown as ringer type boxer briefs and they are solid colors. Disappointed that the photo and description are misleading."
3.0,"The product sizes are confusing in your table, it is a good product good quality and good price. excelent product"
3.0,Not exactly what i expected but it's still nice
3.0,They are supposed to hang layered but they do not to small
3.0,Some of the posts the top part was brown off. And getting the backs on is harder on some of them and other backs didn’t have a hole to put the earring in.
3.0,Beautiful dress but runs very small. Very tight in chest and arms.
3.0,"Good build quality, but tends to run a little slow.  After about a few days it becomes a minute-or-two off.  I'm going to let it run for a week without adjustment and calculate the time drift."
3.0,Cuff on sleeve has a rip in it on 1st wear.
3.0,The chain broke after only wearing it for 2 hours
3.0,Great material not sure about the look
3.0,Really cute cut but super thin and shows everything underneath.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a2165909862014bedab85b22563169d]] These glasses look and feel great, but the polarized lenses are messed up. I don’t know how to describe it, but you can see it in my video. They should be polarized at the same angle, however, these lenses are completely off, so both your eyes are seeing something different. It gives you a headache after a while, and could be dangerous when driving because it can make you dizzy. That’s why I gave them 2 stars for comfort. Hoping I can get a replacement and update this review."
3.0,"It's a really cute shirt and not bad material, but the stitching on the front was so off the black stripes look funny. May still wear it, may return for another one with hopes for better stitching!"
3.0,"This necklace does deserve a better rating from me but I personally think that 'it's okay', rather than 'I like it'.  I just needed a bolder piece in my jewelry collection.  I purchased it more because the ladies that submitted photos of themselves wearing it, you could see that it did go well with numerous colors.<br /><br />The necklace is EXTREMELY light.  Almost, but not quite flimsy.  The beading was overlaid a slightly thicker backing.  And the chain with lobster claw is more than long enough to wear with most tops.  The necklace probably weighs less than a pound and you won't feel it all."
3.0,"Here's the issue.....when I ordered this the link I ordered it from said it was a MENS medium....what I got was an x-large. I'm going to give them to my brother since I got them through the Vine program. They seem like they're good quality, soft, & durable but  I took down the stars for because I can't give this an accurate review since I don't know how long they'll truly last with regular use etc. I'll ask my brother once he uses them a bit but for now this is what it is."
3.0,The dress was fine but it was too long and large (I got the smallest size but I am also pretty small). I wish there were more sizes available. I had to altar it. Otherwise the material was nice and its a pretty and simple dress.
3.0,Cute but it’s a faded red.
3.0,Not sure why soccer shoes are made this narrow.  Do they want kids breaking ankles?  Is the soccer community trying to eliminate kids with wider feet to prop up dwindling pee wee football programs?
3.0,"Could use some padding on the straps but I can get a towel or a light sweater/jacket under the clip and fit my Kindle, wallet, phone, snacks, etc, or even a water bottle, inside the main pocket. Works well for travel.<br /><br />The little pocket hidden on the back is rather pointless. It's not big enough for a phone or a passport or really anything useful."
3.0,I used these to pack for a 2 week trip to Europe. They are light weight as advertised and compress as well as any of these products do.  On my first stop the zipper broke on one of the bags. The zippers just weren’t great quality. I didn’t have problems with any of the other bags but the one with the broken zipper is now useless.
3.0,"This is so sad, the dress is actually so cute, quality seems good but sadly I have to return. I recommend to size up,and keep in mind that the front part is really really short as in the cut is really high, so if you got them curves keep that in mind"
3.0,Looks cheap and a little too glam for my taste.
3.0,"I bought this mask for my son, Kevin, for his junior prom, which had a masquerade theme. Here, because it is more meaningful coming from him, is his review:<br />I got this mask, which looked rather girly in the picture, to wear to the prom. Even though I took it off pretty much right away once I got into the dance, I had one of the highest quality masks there. The design was not as feminine as it appears in the picture online, so it is gender neutral, which was a selling point for me because I didn't want to wear a &#34;girly mask&#34;. It is a fairly durable construction, and the subtle design on the face of the mask attracts some attention without being distracting.<br />I can't say it any better than Westley, &#34;they're terribly comfortable, I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.&#34;<br />However, the one negative aspect of this mask was that the ribbon attached for securing the mask is not terribly secure, especially for something like a high school dance. However, I (read: my mom) switched it out for elastic covered with felt, which made the mask much more secure."
3.0,"Loved the quality and comfort in these sandals but the fit was too small. I usually wear an 8 1/2 so I bought a 9. My feet fit, but just bearly so I ended up returning them. Can't quite wrap my mind around trying a 10. We'll see..."
3.0,Beautiful color but really tight around the neck
3.0,every pair of leather reefs i've had (5 or 6 over the last 13-14 years) have progressively decreased in quality/longevity and increased in price. These lasted a couple years. Now wearing rainbows and hari maris
3.0,can't wear band and pins are defective
3.0,Very hard to set up<br />Poor instructions.
3.0,This is a beautiful bag but it's a little too small for all my stuff.
3.0,Don't like the material<br />I don't think it's flattering<br />Would not recommend
3.0,Fit very weird. Didn't fit as I had hoped for. I felt like a short sack of potatoes in overalls. Lollol
3.0,"I was a little bummed.  Looked great in the picture and the top half fit as expected.  Unfortunately it was shorter than pictured and just barely covered my backside.  For reference I am 5'3&#34; and 140 - usually length is not a problem for me.  Sad to send it back, but it didn't work for what I was ultimately looking for."
3.0,"Very flattering cut and fit. However, the material is very stretchy and thin. So much to where I’m hesitant to wear it out. Such a shame. I wouldn’t have minded paying a few dollars more for better quality."
3.0,"Runs very small. I’m generally a 1x, ordered a 2x given the low price and past experience. Still too small. Disappointing!"
3.0,The only reason I returned it was I didnt like the way it looked on me.
3.0,I order a hat stretcher to make it not so tight
3.0,I liked the price and look but didn't like that it was a wind up watch.
3.0,"Top is thin and large. I ordered M and I'm 5'6&#34; 145 lb, I should've ordered a S instead because the shoulders and bust area are a bit baggy on me. Length is just past my hips. There's a seam down the middle of the back. It's pretty with black leggings or fitted capris."
3.0,"I really like to organizer box. Came with plenty of batteries, some odd sizes that I hope will not go out on date anytime soon and too few of the two most common types that I have had to re supply. THe tool itself is not of that great quality. Good enough for changing batteries now and them, but not much more. The pin remover broke on the first use. Would probably have invested a little more in the tool kit itself to get better quality. But a good enough deal because of the batteries."
3.0,Fit well but has many sharp edges that hurt my heel and ankle. Filed down area where zipper is to help for comfort.
3.0,"Charm is small, but cute.  I ordered it on Feb. 3, 2015.  It arrived Mar. 6, 2015 via Air Mail from China."
3.0,Length was great but the band was so tight and I ordered up in size. Looks as pictured
3.0,The ring guard is acceptable. You have to make sure it is on the ring securely or it will come off.
3.0,These are extremely see through buyer beware
3.0,"Run really BIG, buy 2 sizes down.."
3.0,Great watch except for the digital display. The digital part is too dark to read the time.
3.0,I love them. I love how they fit (I am only 5'1&#34;) but  the inside is lined in white so they end up lighter and see through while on. They mighy just be at home pants :(
3.0,"If you have junk in the trunk, these are not for you."
3.0,3 stars because the quality was not the best. Cheap material
3.0,Fabric quality  was great. Color was beautiful. Looks like it was an irregular fit.  Not sure if I received a dress from an irregular lot.  The top was huge and draped oddly. The back of the top draped to my butt.
3.0,I sent the first one back which was a medium and  I ordered a large and that was the same size as the medium which were both like smalls. And I have one in a different color that fits perfect and that one is a medium so needless  to say I have sent both the grey ones back.
3.0,They shrunk a little in the wash. Wouldn't buy this type again.
3.0,"I have small hands and ordered the small size. They fit great except each finger was about an inch too long. Weird... I've never had this problem before, so it's definitely an off fit.<br />I returned them."
3.0,I had to return as the 2xl was not actually 2xl.  Seems like a well  made jacket just runs small.
3.0,Nice finishing touch to my Halloween costume
3.0,The swimsuit was good quality but just did not fit as I expected.
3.0,"These seem to good quality, however after reading &#34;mesh bags&#34; &#34;mesh bags&#34; over and over again I made the mistake of thinking these were an open mesh. Instead, the mesh provides extra protection and reinforcement over top of a tightly-sealed clear plastic bag. So if you want something to protect items from getting wet in the first place these will probably work great. However if you want something made of open mesh you can use for damp or sweaty clothes you wore outdoors, in the rain, running, to the gym etc. in which will allow them to dry out, then these organizers will trap the moisture inside so you're more likely to get mildew or other things growing.<br /><br />You will not learn these are tightly sealed from the bulleted list of features. My bad for clicking &#34;buy&#34; after I read &#34;mesh bags&#34; for the second or third time and not reading to the very final bitter end of the product description where it mentions (almost as an afterthought)  &#34;...and since there's a waterproof lining, you don't have to worry about unwanted spills and messes.&#34;<br /><br />So nothing wrong with the product itself, but the product description is lousy because it's potentially misleading."
3.0,Cute but  gives a weird baggy crotch
3.0,"soul separated after 3 weeks , had to reglue, but otherwise they are decent for the price"
3.0,purple not as dark as appears..
3.0,They are somewhat slippery on a wooden floor.
3.0,Shirt fits okay but the pants are HUGE
3.0,The sleeves are not cuffed as the pictures show which is deceiving and disappointing.
3.0,I like the purse and will use it sometime.  The leather? is not as soft as I'd like it to be. And the hardware looks a bit inexpensive for my taste.
3.0,Too small and mesh material so see through
3.0,Most of these chokers broke . But I love most of them
3.0,Great Hat. Love it and planning to take on trip to a hot area. One problem was that it was a little large. I didn't want to keep searching and/or return so I found 1/16&#34; cork sheet and glued it under the hat band using white glue. The fit is much better now and am waiting for the white glue to dry to see if it holds.
3.0,It's a nice hat and all but the color was deceptive. I thought it would be gold or yellow emblem but it was county orange instead .
3.0,Material heavy polyester. Not a good material for summer.  It had nice seaming though.
3.0,Not as soft as I was hoping but still good.  True to color.
3.0,"I bought these for my firs triathlon and was very pleased at first. The legs fit comfortably and the waist was also very comfortable. Despite these positives, the material was very thin and when stretched it became see through. If you wear underwear, it would be ok. You’re not supposed to wear underwear with triathlon shorts, so that’s why they get 3 stars. They are super cute and colorful too. I really wanted to love them, but I’m not fond of my behind  being visible for all to see."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this shirt, but I can’t. It’s the right size, so order what you would normally wear, but it’s a thick shirt and slightly boxy, so when I wear it it makes me look like I have very broad shoulders. Part of it is because I ordered a 2XL or 3XL because I’m a big girl, so a big, almost all black shirt, is already going to make me look bigger than I am, but the way it’s cut makes me look like a football player. If it was cut differently, or made of slightly thinner material, I’d be 100% in love with it. Bottom line, if you’re on the bigger side, find a different shirt."
3.0,I love Calvin Klein and own several of these thongs so I was really excited to see my favorite color. When they arrived they were not as pictured and really dull. The purple is more grey. Wouldn't recommend this color but would recommend the product.
3.0,I loved the pattern on this suit and was hesitant ordering one offline. I usually wear a large so I ordered an XL and it fit surprisingly well. The only thing is that the chest part is spaced very far apart. My nipples were almost showing because of the poor coverage. I wear a 38 C. But I simply sewed the middle of the suit together to pull the cups together and viola! It worked! Bottoms are a little tight but not too uncomfortable. Overall I am satisfied especially with the price of the suit
3.0,I started by ordering a few pairs of the blues and purples. I decided to order a black pair but unfortunately I have to return them as they are NOT squat proof. I’ve only had this issue with the black pair. Which sucks cause I love black
3.0,"It is a little awkward fit and it's a bit too short, very lightweight sheer material.  I just need it to wear under my blazer so it's fine for that purpose but I wouldn't wear it to work without a cami underneath."
3.0,"I LOVE the product but beware. I typically wear a size small and I think I ended up getting the size large and the bottom was tight. I am hourglass shaped with a big butt so the way it fit me was tight on the thighs and butt, loose on the waist, and a little big on the boobs BUT it looks to be pretty low cut in the photo so I cant hold that against them. BTW My important measurements are 24-26 inch waist depending on the day and a 32DD bra size."
3.0,Cute and the frames are durable but the lens scratched very easily.
3.0,"I used them as a stocking stuffer for my christmas gifts.  It was perfect as a little add-on to the gifts.  However, one broke as I was pulling it together to form the strawberry.<br />But very cute nonetheless."
3.0,"I got a 3x, normally a 2x, and its pretty tight, enough so it's hard to layer. But the ""velcro"" or ""hook and loop"" are poor in quality with the fuzzy part becoming very worn out and soft and also the part that detached and hangs from the cuff thats used to adjust it, it made of some kind of semi-hard plastic/syntethic material with verylittle spiked posts, instead of it being a piece the main material with the opposite side of the velcro that's harder and sticks to the softer part of the velcro."
3.0,It was more simple than I thought It would be. I hope the battery won't die in few months like the 1st one I bought. I gave it 3 stars because I still like swatch no matter what.
3.0,"This is a gift for my husband, and it's nice light weight jacket for cooler days.  The only issue is that he has broad shoulders so it's a little fitting in that area but overall still fits him nicely and he said it does feel too tight where he can't move in it."
3.0,Agree with other reviews... too tight. Order a size or two up. But cute top!
3.0,as noted in other - it runs small.  I think the fabric is a little thin for a white dress
3.0,"It's ok.. not terrible, not great"
3.0,"Bag was smaller than expected. It's advertised as a beach bag,  but it's waaaay smaller. You can fit maybe a wash cloth and a few other small travel sized items in it, but that's about it."
3.0,great colors but the masks slide off the clips easily after a few days.
3.0,Warm. Not as cute as the reviews I read claimed. No shedding issue with mine.
3.0,I run A LOT and although these shoes are cute they're not worth purchasing if you run log distance because they don't protect your foot or legs like brooks or other high quality running shoes. The soles of my feet got really sore after running 4 miles in them and after a couple days of using them I started getting shin splints. I'm going to have to go back to Brooks
3.0,"I use them on my volleyball shoes to avoid walkign ont he ground and losing my sole to the road. These are great, a little too tight. I intend to make holes to make it breathable, and also cut a slit to make it easier to put on and take off. Other than that, failry good and do the job"
3.0,"Cute dress, longer than expected."
3.0,"It buttons up, not zips so you need to wear something underneath that will show.  The buttons are far apart so it is hard to keep shut.  The tail is &#34;weird&#34; and had to be safety pinned to the back to stay out of the way.  It is very soft and cuddly and served it's purpose for a pokemon birthday party though."
3.0,Loved it - but it fell off.. LOST IT.  WAAAAH!
3.0,"Lands End has traditionally given me a decent to good product so I decided to get this shirt from their online store a few years ago. I liked it so I ordered another one on here about 5-6 months ago. Again, it worked out well. Then, I made another order. Not so good this time. The fabric was of a heavier weight. I can't wear a heavy weight long sleeve shirt as long sleeves are bad enough as it is. I live in a very warm climate area and we have 70 degree weather most weeks at least 9-10 months out of the year. It isn't unusual to have it in the 2 months it isn't common. Anyway, a little weight in a shirt makes a huge difference to me and I know what I can tolerate. If this doesn't mean much to you or you actually like heavier shirts, then ignore this point, but be aware: some shirts MAY be lighter than others.<br /><br />I think bought 2 or 3 more in a Lands End retail store that are essentially the same shirt. The weight was fine but while one worked, the other one didn't. Why? It wasn't non-iron though it was labeled as such. It didn't come out of the dryer looking like it had been at the bottom of a closet for a year but it definitely needed touch up ironing to be worn. That's a no-go for me and why I bought this shirt in the first place. I have a whole closet full of shirts that need to be taken to the laundry; why would I need one more? Now I have to return that one to the store as I did the last one from Amazon.<br /><br />I'm going to look for another brand. I will say fit is good and product seems to be well made. The ones that work do come out of the dryer pretty much ready to wear (recommend a 15 minute hang time; overnight is better). In rare cases, such as travel you MIGHT want to take a warm iron or a steamer to it. I'm sure the shirt that came out wrinkled would respond OK but, like I said, I have other such shirts that are like that.<br /><br />The sizing and pricing varies on this shirt and it may (as of mid-2021) be discontinued. The LE buyer needs to shore up the actual factory where this shirt is being made and get more consistency. Until then, I wouldn't recommend it unless ironing a non-iron shirt doesn't bother you."
3.0,Did not fit like I would have liked
3.0,I did not like the fit at all.  Very disapointed
3.0,"Very pretty bracelet but after a week i lost the link that hold the 925 stamp,good thing it happened at home, and at least it didn't turn green like the last one i got, otherwise very nice."
3.0,Very pretty. A little smaller than anticipated! But pretty!
3.0,"I absolutely loved the design of this dress but, unfortunately, I had to return it.<br />I ordered my usual size and it fit me everywhere but the arms. I have larger triceps and the sleeves of the dress did not stretch AT ALL so I wasn’t able to wear it. Pretty disappointing.<br />Other notable cons are the overwhelming chemical scent and the threads that repeatedly got stuck in the zipper. Not a great experience.<br />Overall, it’s a very pretty dress but definitely not the best quality."
3.0,Item was not sized as advertised. No way it would fit as sized the text descriptor. Otherwise a nice product. Not sure how you rate an item that is not useable - can always donate it.
3.0,Very soft socks but they run small. The outside is not as soft as the inside. I gave them to my granddaughter and she likes them.
3.0,There's no tailoring to the shirt--like the picture makes it look. The seams are straight/the shirt is square. It works for me to hide the extra baby weight (post baby).
3.0,It is a lovely top but definitely runs a great deal  smaller than expected !! Had to go up I think at least 3 sizes for the second one I ordered and is a bit short in length so when you reach up it rides up.
3.0,The length was perfect but the chest was super tight.
3.0,"Nice cut, cheap fabric"
3.0,"Size is smaller than expected, had to return"
3.0,"Thin vinyl. Works but less protection than with nitrel.<br />Fits larger than a small, more like a medium"
3.0,The shirt is well made and looks great. However it is at least two sizes smaller than the label states.  You will need a XXXL if you normally wear an XL
3.0,nothing fancy does the trick
3.0,Too glittery for my taste/
3.0,"Shiny and pretty, worked perfectly as a gift. The pin was hard to undo as it seems to have been crushed under the ring in transit. But it wasn't hard to pull back the ring and make it work."
3.0,Good looking belt. In my experience hard too get off though. Defecated my pants attempting to undo the belt buckle. Not recommended for weak men who can't work ratchet technology.
3.0,The sizes run about 1/2 size smaller. Says 8.5 to 9.5. Runs more 8 to 9. And soul inside is loose.
3.0,"Attractive shirt but fabric is ""stiffer"" than expected - somewhat similar to a medium starched shirt.  Also, button holes are very tight.  While they will stretch out over time, they do make it a chore to button and unbutton.  But, nice looking shirt.  Definitely go up a size as previous reviews indicate."
3.0,"I was sooo excited to wear this costume for a Starwars event, however it was super small. I went up a size for safety but unfortunately it didn’t help. The first time I put this one the zipper split in half!!! Hours before my event too!!! So I had to see myself into the corset. Also my gloves were ripped. This costume was cheaply made. I still looked cute though!!"
3.0,"The pajamas are cute, but the shorts on a 1X are a little big, and the top is very short."
3.0,"I ordered the green one because I love luna moths, however what I got was totally blue. I would have looked past that if it had the wing tails but it didn’t have those either. All in all it’ll work fine for my costume just a little bummed that it wasn’t luna wings."
3.0,"Size says one size fits most.  If you wear M/L in original band that came with watch, this is a tad bit shorter.  Loved it but not comfortable with the idea this could pop open and I could lose my watch."
3.0,To wiggly for me. Cheap.
3.0,I haven't worn this hat yet but it's as cute as pictured.
3.0,"not much to say, I wasn't disappointed.  IT is kinda cute, did not return this one. little cheesy so didn't give it as a Christmas gift,"
3.0,Easy to use<br /> Allows good access to diaper
3.0,It’s ok I ordered an x Large I’m about 5/8 and about 150 lbs and I thought it would cover entire stomach area and it don’t I was looking at photo when I ordered seeing it covers her stomach this one comes prob above belly button a little below I’ve un tigentend the straps and still a little stomach shows but overall it’s cute
3.0,"These earrings are light weight, which I like, but look incredibly cheap.  I will be returning."
3.0,"Does NOT fit newborn. At least, not if they are 7lbs. They are cute for the most part. Disappointed that it will be awhile before she can use them."
3.0,Not rue to size! Legs were too short
3.0,"I bought these for a costume (a minion) with the intention of being able to wear them regularly, too. However, that won’t be happening. They looked like I had them on backwards, with back pockets in the front and very loose up front. Strange."
3.0,"The ring is beautiful, however, I can't get the ring in.  I would love to wear this one and the others I bought."
3.0,"Nice dress, but I felt the length was a bit odd. I have something similar so I returned."
3.0,I love the looks of this shirt but it is very tight and has very little give.
3.0,priced a bit high even for so-called Italian leather.  Think again
3.0,"Looked good until the 4th time I wore them, when the backing decided not to stay connected anymore. These are obviously very, very cheaply made. I threw them out because they kept falling off my ears. Disappointing"
3.0,it looked nice except it frayed at the first use. I ended up cutting the loose yarn. not as expected.
3.0,"It's a cute cover up. However I didnt realize the sides are big open slits. If the sides were closed, I would like it on me better. I am returning it."
3.0,"I love the style of this shoe but it fit too small. I’m usually an 8, I bought 8.5 and still need to size up to 9.5 at least. Too late to return too bad."
3.0,"I loved the piercing,  and thinkbit is pretty. I had no issues with reaction,  and I kept it in for about 2 weeks. I will say I had A LOT of trouble since it screws on in the back, it is impossible to see with tragus piercing, will not order another that screws on in back."
3.0,"The hat looks fairly well made, but it doesn't have that finished quality you see at your favorite mall store. The diamond is slightly off center, but all in all a decent hat for the price."
3.0,Did not stretch as much as I would have expected.
3.0,"I ordered the correct size, and another jacket that was purchased was the right fit from the same retailer."
3.0,"These aren't bad quality, but I only have 5 different styles! What am I suppose to do with duplicates. It just says 10 pieces, not that there's only five variations. Very disappointing."
3.0,Cute shoe but very cheaply made. I have two pair of these and one the insoles fell apart within two weeks and the other pair the shoes actually fell apart after about a month. Neither pair were worn daily either so they weren’t worn much.
3.0,"It's made for girls without hips!  It is very straight line from top to bottom, so if you have curves on the hips, it will fit tight there.  Otherwise, it is ok. Not top quality, but not the worst I've seen.  I will wear it with a compression slip and see how it goes."
3.0,"It's heavy with all the &#34;hardware&#34; and I'm not impressed with the orange lining.  Also, one of the rivets along the side popped out after only a couple of day's use.  I'm keeping it because I like the color and all the pockets."
3.0,Color not as expected.  Didn't realize there was purple in this dress. I was expecting a blue dress with white flowers.  Still pretty and fits as should.
3.0,"They look ok on, but warp how my GPS / phone and window look in the car."
3.0,Really cheaply made but will do for a cheap dress.
3.0,"The picture makes you think the entire bag is striped. But the stripes are only on one side of the bag and the other side is solid and looks boring. However, the bag is fairly sturdy."
3.0,No buena calidad
3.0,This is cute but not well made.  I noticed the seam on the front bottom string was coming loose my first time wearing it.  I flipped it over and saw there was a big hole forming where the 1 lightly stitched seam was connecting the bottom layered look.
3.0,"Was able to wear about 10 times for a few hours at a time without the finish coming off. I've had it a couple months and it's now starting to wear off. I wish it wasn't just coated, however for the price I would say it's worth it."
3.0,Expected a little higher quality but I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I was digging it at first but the the clock part kept falling off. Then the chain started rusting... So after the clock part fell into the abyss, I threw the rusted chain away.... Guess the shinigami wanted it back 😕 ...... It was cool while it lasted though"
3.0,"I purchased this because I needed a small bag to transport a pair of training shoes, athletic pants/shorts, and a T-shirt to change into at the gym after work. I only need it for 3 days a week maximum, so a big brand name to ensure amazing quality was not a requirement.<br /><br />I was surprised how perfect this bag is for my needs. It has a detachable shoulder strap, and it is very compact if you need to store it. I was also expecting the color to be unattractive because the green bag is a dollar cheaper than the other colors. It's actually a very pleasant forest green, as pictured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the zipper pull on one of the side circular pockets was already broken off the zipper grip when I opened the package, but it is not the end of the world to me. Unless I would get credit for the whole purchase including the $5.50 shipping fee, I don't think it's worth a return and/or exchange. I'll live with it, and I'll hopefully find a way to repair it.<br /><br />The shipping speed was excellent. I ordered it Thursday morning, it shipped from California, and I received it in Chicago by Saturday (48 hours). This was shipped via the US postal service.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great deal for someone who needs a small, basic bag, and who doesn't care that the plastic portions on the bag can potentially break.<br /><br />Update*** The main zipper completely broke, and I cannot find where it popped off. I will not purchase again since it didn't last a whole 3 months. Rating demoted from 4 stars to 3 stars. It's a good buy for short term, but the zippers will not last."
3.0,Not worth $11.00
3.0,"Decent quality strap however absolutely reeks, smells like an old tire."
3.0,"1st I was OMG! I Love it! Make them in gold please,... Then about a month later they became brownish, tarnished color and got my ears infected so I wrote a bad review...<br /><br />Customer service contacted me really fast and send me another pair of &#34;Ear Jacket Peeking Feather Rhodium Plated Stud...&#34;<br />but I do not know if I m unlucky or if its really because of the quality but I received one with a stone missing. you can see on pics the new one with the stone missing and the old one.<br /><br />The design super cute, I will totally buy it from you guys if you make them in sterling silver, gold, or white gold but for nowI think I m good.<br />Glad it works for most of you guys..."
3.0,"These shoes are very comfortable and I wore mine everywhere. But the Fila people need to use stronger glue on the bottom sole. The tread, starting from the front to the back, falls off after about a month. So, either make the price $10, or increase the durability."
3.0,I love that is easy to clean up .
3.0,It was a nice but it was more a shirt than a dress 😂
3.0,"The bar sticks to the boobs very well but, there was no support."
3.0,"I was reluctant to purchase with no reviews, but thrilled to see that the color I wanted was available in my size with Prime shipping.  Unfortunately, the sizing chart was inaccurate based on the dress I received.  The waist and hips fit well, but because the back was cut very small, the dress fit in front, but wouldn't come close to being able to close in the back.  Unfortunately, I am having to return this, but hope that this vendor will offer larger sizes with Prime shipping in the future.  I would absolutely love to own this dress in my size!!!"
3.0,A very nice sweater but way too small. I wear a 1x but decided to buy a 3x to make sure it fit. It is more like a large. I wish it had been the right size.
3.0,"little cheap materiel, but okay"
3.0,Look as describes beautiful
3.0,pretyy pattern and the colors are what I wanted. the size is as advertised but not generous. machine roled hem.  looked OK.
3.0,I could not wear the hat because it was too narrow for my head.  I end up giving it to my mom for a garden hat.
3.0,"After about a month of wearing every day, the black color is rubbing off.  As far as getting my husband thru the metal detectors at work, it's great, but it's too expensive to have the finish rubbing off this soon."
3.0,"It did not fit like the pictures, I don't know that a different size would have helped."
3.0,Too much fabric again for me. I bought two...should have waited to check fit. :(
3.0,I like the graphics but it was too long
3.0,I liked this at first but as time wen by they turned my big toes black
3.0,"The velvet is very thin, you can pretty much see through it in the light.  But I suppose for a halloween costume clock that's fine.  The tie is also just a piece of ribbon."
3.0,The suitcases are a little small
3.0,Not exactly what I expected. They are almost too lightweight. They are a loose fit and let in some cold air. Okay for the price.
3.0,"It works once you get it on however you have to be pretty flexible to get it on,"
3.0,"Quality on these is good. My only complaint is that they were too small for me, and I followed the sizing directions closely."
3.0,"The red color is not a rich red, more like a dark orange."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress, tts and fits great!  One flaw, I finally wore it for a wedding and the shoulder piece fall off within the first two hours…. I was so disappointed."
3.0,Not a good fit!
3.0,"Quality and service were great, but I just didn't realize how tiny they would be.  I won't wear them, but too much trouble to return.  Will donate.  Some young person will like them"
3.0,"For the price, this is a very sturdy, durable pair of oversized sunglasses.  The major drawback is that the glasses are not big enough to accommodate my prescription driving glasses so aren't particularly useful for the purpose I intended.  However, they work well with a smaller pair of reading glasses  and will be going on my next cruise to allow me to read my kindle poolside."
3.0,I like this waist trainer because it fits someone who is big.I got it for someone and who is a little bit on the high side and she really loves it.I think it will really help her alot during her work out sessions.its nice.
3.0,"This robe is a beautiful color, super soft, and fits well.  It is rather thin though.  I was expecting a more plush and thick robe.  It will be fine in the warmer months."
3.0,"We got the brown shows with the bow decoration. They are super cute, but the material they are made from (I hesitate to call it leather, because it does not look or feel like real leather) is pretty thin, and they just feel cheap. My daughter does love how they look, but I don't think they will last long. I will update after a few wears!"
3.0,Leather necklace isn't comfortable and leaves residue. The anchor itself is nice though.
3.0,"Cute, but runs a smidge small and is not as long as in the picture"
3.0,Doesn't go off the shoulder like expected
3.0,order a size bigger!! nice shirt though
3.0,Beautiful belt but so disappointed in the size. I’m between 27-28 inch waist (4 jeans) and this belt at even my upper mid section is too small. There is a 3 1/2 inch gap. I sucked in as much as possible because i love the look of the belt and nice quality. But misleading. Will not fit unless you are very small waisted.
3.0,Didn’t keep it because I didn’t love the fit on me but it was a cute dress
3.0,The chains breaks easily. Soft for wrists.
3.0,"I got a great deal, so the price was right for this cute little sock monkey, but when he arrived his little body and face were all squished and sewn kind of funny... Not really the best quality sock monkey, and I had to tug at his ears a lot to try and unsquish his face so he wouldn't look like a badly swollen prize-fighter. He was also much smaller than I imagined he would be. Any smaller and he'd need a key ring... Almost. Still, VERY cute overall, and the person who got him as a gift loved him."
3.0,Was really amazing apart from coming bent . Did get stuck in my nose though
3.0,Rather heavy on the ears
3.0,Great product American made can only really fit 6 cards not RFID proof and if you pick yellow you are not guaranteed to get the black letters on your wallet
3.0,I like it but it did leave  my armpit with a slight red stain and transfer to my clothing.
3.0,I should have looked at the size better as it is much smaller than I wxmted
3.0,"I love the band and how easy it is to adjust since I have very small wrist. I have worn it everyday for over a week and I see no color change of the metal. The face cover wasn't the best, it popped off and I lost it so I had to rebuy them."
3.0,The pants are more for casual wear. More of a sweat pant than dress socks as shown. Made small so size UP. I don’t see myself wearing them out of the house. Not a flattering fit😔
3.0,I bought this to wear for a special event. It was fine for that purpose.
3.0,Loved how soft this sweater is! Too bad it’s too short for my arms :( also lots of fuzzies came off when I tried it on
3.0,"Maybe I would have been more satisfied if I'd ordered a smaller size. If it had more spandex to make a more snug fit, I'd like it better. The lace sleeve/strap is pretty as is the color."
3.0,"Ok, I'm 5'6&#34; I wear a 34A bra, my measurements are 34, 28, 39.  I've got broader than average shoulders but they're by no means huge.  First I ordered a Small in black because of posts I read.  It came, I tried it on, it was a little on the big side, which is weird cause I'd typically get a medium especially because my hips are pretty hippy.  But up top, it was quite loose in the shoulder to breast area, and then the waist area was larger than I'd prefer, so I decided to return it because of size, but I still really liked it and wanted to have one of these in my casual summer wardrobe, and so I decided to order one in a size smaller which would be an extra small, and this time I went with gray.  When this one came I looked like a sausage.  I mean it was bad.  Even the top part was super tight.  So if you buy gray I would get your normal size, if you buy black I would get 2 sizes smaller!  Lol!  Who knows.  Good thing they make returns pretty easy!"
3.0,Would get a bigger size
3.0,Probably ok for a teenager or someone with a smaller than normal head.
3.0,"It looks good, but i don't like the 100% synthetic material that it's made off. I didn't wash it yet, so we will see how it turns out after washing. It's unfortunately very cheaply made and it's definitely not worth the $30"
3.0,Too small. Read the reviews
3.0,They are cheap looking but comfortable
3.0,Alot bigger than i expected. The stone anyway
3.0,I got this item a lil over a month ago but never got the chance to test it out. When I finally did ole of the straps that go across the chest came off after a onetime use during a walk. I'm very disappointed as I expect this bag to last for a while.
3.0,"The ring is pretty, but it isn't sterling silver. The ring started to turn my finger green in three days (but yet again I washed my hands wearing it, so that determined it really wasn't sterling silver). So, if you want it because its pretty remember to take it off when you come into contact with water."
3.0,Some shoes differ in sizes. These seem to run small. Gave them to a friend. I couldn’t fit them
3.0,I don't like the pocket
3.0,Did it fit over my glasses
3.0,Pants are a little long.
3.0,"Nothing special, just a t-shirt with a string.<br />It absolutely is not true to size, I am size 8 and bought a medium. It would fit kinda like on the model is I thought an xl."
3.0,Wish the wireframe was easier to adjust
3.0,"Cute dress and fits perfectly, however material is thin so wouldn’t wear it outside unless dark or going to non well light places. Very comfortable and breezy on hot days and great to wear around the house or quick drive-thru errands."
3.0,I wish I could tell you about this shirt.  I was so excited & was going to wear it to AC.  It got delivered to the wrong apartment & never returned to me.  The delivery person didn’t take a picture of the door with the apt#....duh.  I m afraid to order again.  Never found anything like it & I m sure I would have loved it
3.0,These earrings a very cute. I bought them for my 4y/o. The needle part of the earring is very short so it is extremely hard to screw the back on. They would probably be a good fit for a baby.
3.0,The 4 year old girl that got the gift still loved it but I was a little embarrassed about the size! It looked like I had spent less on the gift
3.0,Fabric is pretty thin. Cutouts are dangerously low near the panty line. Great for a beach cover up when you want to go straight to dinner. NOT FOR NORMAL WEAR.
3.0,The bangles are amazing considering the price point.  I was quite surprised how well the are made.  Unfortunately the brackets are smaller than I thought they would be considering they are 7.5 .  I work a lot with hands and because of the snug fit they pop open ALOT.  So often I removes them to avoid loosing  them.  So into the jewelry box they go until I see my nieces and gift them.
3.0,"Looks like decent quality but absolutely HUGE. I’ve typically worn a size Large shirt for decades in most brands. Per the other reviews, I ordered a Small in this one. I don’t know who sizes these things, or who it’s supposed to fit. But unless you have a huge gut, it’ll be too big. I’m having to return the small. I have a slim athletic build but this small fits me like a typical XL. To the vendor - Come on guys, get your sizing right!"
3.0,"I do like these pants but the zip in the back doesn't work well. I ended up taking the buttons off the front completely. Overall, they are cute."
3.0,"Pretty little clutch,  but limited slots for credit cards, narrow change compartment, great if you dont plan on keeping much in it"
3.0,Huge A line. very loose. Very thin fabric. not figure flattering at all. Go smaller would be my reco.
3.0,I really loved the bracelet when it arrived. But I wore it to work a few times and the blue beads color wore off. Disappointed to say the least. But I really loved it.
3.0,These sweaters are not nearly as roomy as advertised.
3.0,You can see through it they are very shiny
3.0,"The dress itself is gorgeous, but the zipper sticks out like a roll on the side, and mine was delivered with the seams split in the front. I was so sad because I loved this dress."
3.0,The ones that worked were as expected but almost 1/2 of them did not work at all.  I had bought them as a party favor so everyone could have at least 4 but  did not have enough that worked.
3.0,I thought I read carefully but didnt. Surprised to receive and only get one for 9.99.  Buyers be aware of what you are getting if you need two!
3.0,It looks better on picture
3.0,I would have given this shirt 5 stars because it's beautiful but it is itchy. I got a large.
3.0,"but i like it, its okay."
3.0,I bought these a while ago and they were great for flat feet. I decided to order another as a replacement. I'm extremely disappointed in the changes they made. The pictures speak for themselves. The arch support used to be very pronounced and great for flat feet but now these sandals are just like any other sandal you buy. The khaki pair were my old pair.
3.0,"Although this Swimsuit is very cute, it runs really REALLY small. The 2x runs more like a xl. I was this suit was more curvy girl friendly."
3.0,"It's pretty good for the price. But I did have some issues: I was not expecting the red outline on the belt. The flags on the centerpiece are not as accurately detailed as in the picture (these two facts make me think the picture is of a previous or more expensive version of the belt). The side plates are either plastic or very thin tin, and they bend easily. One of mine had some sort of drip down the middle that would not scrub off (fortunately I was covering that one with a sticker). All the plates are a bit off-center, making the belt look cheap.  There's a &#34;TITLE Boxing&#34; patch on one side that I'm thinking about covering with a state or US flag patch."
3.0,"Bent posts upon arrival...but easy to bend back into place=cheaply made I suspect. They were bigger than I anticipated, look funny in the 2nd hole (which is where I wanted them), probably better in the first one where the lobe is bigger. Ibhave yet to wear them to see if/how long they take to tarnish. Will update then. I suppose you get what you pay for 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,"I ordered the medium but it is still too big, fingers too long. The touch screen feature is virtually non-existent. Looks good though."
3.0,I like this look but the material was much thinner than I thought it would be. The top fiit snug! The small little jewel is kind of weird too!
3.0,"The dress color is nice, but the material was a little thin. Dress didn't go well with my body type."
3.0,if you are looking for quality this is not the product. very sheer and light. Tore within the first day of wearing it. Great for a custume type of thing but not for long use
3.0,The material was a little too thin for me.
3.0,Very tiny!!! I didn’t realize how little this purse would be. My girls keeps their little lip glosses in it and a pair of sunglasses (can’t zip it with the sunglasses). They’re cute for Christmas time. The straps are a little hard to adjust but my husband was able to get it done. My girls (7 and 3) are happy about them! 🙌🏻
3.0,"Es bonito, pero la tela no es gruesa como aparenta en la foto. Bajo el sol se te ve un poco la ropa interior. Si quieres volumen abajo, tendrás que ponerte algo adicional. Pero, para una actividad sencilla, pues, resuelve."
3.0,Cute style but way too short and small
3.0,the flower was bigger than it looks
3.0,"Bought the black leather pants, they were ok fitting, a little tight at the waist but the rest was ok!"
3.0,The size and it's costing much more than the dress cost to return it.
3.0,"Kinda disappointed in this dress, it’s cute and all, but just such thin fabric. It’s a nice color and the neck is pretty too. But it comes and an odd length, it’s either way too short of a dress or too long to be worn as a stylish tunic. But I don’t hate it."
3.0,The glasses don’t look too weird. They relax my sight when working and make colors sharper. The materials are fragile and the lense already is scratched when I was wiping it out.
3.0,"The ring is way oversized,  be much better if it was smaller in size"
3.0,"Oversized, heavyweight flannel shirt. Does not wash well and must be ironed after each washing. Not exactly what I look for in a casual shirt."
3.0,Run small. I should’ve ordered an extra large. So large is really a medium. Print quality is good. But the T-shirt itself could’ve been a little thicker.
3.0,Dropped them once and scratched the lens. When I looked closer I could see the lens get scratched but the blue tint started to peel off. I peeled it back all the way to the frame exposing a grey lens. It almost looked like they just painted over the normal lens with a thin coat of blue paint. But thats what you get for &#62;$10 sunglasses.
3.0,"I love the way this dress looks. I wish the fabric was more of a cotton instead of the silky fabric. Also, my dress arrived and IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY POCKETS!  To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I will buy almost any dress that has pockets. I debated on returning but decided to keep it because I like the color and the fit."
3.0,I love the look of this bathing suit but the cups are a lot smaller then I was expecting. It's still a cute bathing suit!
3.0,"It was what I expected, fits good, headband was a little heavy so I’ll have to use Bobby pins to keep it up, a small hole was in the fabric on the headband, pants less spandex-y than I expected, not really legging material, but overall, decent, and cheap, good enough for a couple time use."
3.0,Took forever to receive and the shoes were wet when received.
3.0,They look great and made well.  Just didn't fit like the pair we bought previously.  Had to send them back.
3.0,Probably made in China. Very thin material<br />and sizes are small to American sizes.<br />Don't waste your money .
3.0,"Cute but, I thought it would be bigger. Very cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I got this little crossbody because I go to multiple events a year and a lot of the places have new bag policies. Pay attention to the measurements, I knew what I was getting, but the photo in the listing that shows the two people wearing the crossbody make it look bigger than it is. The zippers seem like they are decent quality, but the zipper pulls are very light weight and cheap feeling. The crossbody bag has silver hardware, but the decorative strap has gold. I was hoping the decorative strap would be canvas, but it's a silky fabric. The actual bag is a thick pliable plastic that looks to be sewn well."
3.0,"The yellow is not yellow as pictured, but very clearly a shade of orange."
3.0,"I purchased this item as a sentimental gift to my girlfriend. She loves sea turtles, and the plumeria flower has a even deeper emotional connection between her and her late brother who passed away too soon. So when I saw this necklace it was &#34;a must&#34; to get it for her. When I received the necklace I first noticed the quality wasn't as detailed as it is shown in the photographs. Secondly it just seemed too big, versus how it is represented to be scale wise also in the photos shown on-line. Still, overall she was ecstatic to see that I had found a gift that suited her likes so well. However I'm not so sure I won't try and seek such items out in-person, instead of purchasing them on-line in the future. It never seems like as nice of a product or as good of a deal once you actually see the product you've purchased. Just my opinion. Happy shopping!"
3.0,"The cons :The dress fits somewhat off,  the piece in the middle that would give you some definition from your bust to your waist it doesn't, I hope explained that ok. Also the arms seem to be sewed a little off, like too far down maybe for example, when you raise your arm the whole dress goes up. The fabric is a bit see thru, don't wear a white bra, you will see it. The pros beautiful and vibrant colors, love the pockets, love the shape, the perfect pleat for a girl with wide hips. I normally wear a 20W, but I purchased a 22W, I thought my arms needed it, and they did. I did get my dress altered in the waist area.  Once she pinned the dress it was perfect. I will post a picture when I pick it up from the seamtres. I will be buying the black one too!"
3.0,"This looks pretty, but it's a lot smaller than I expected it to be. Perhaps it's just my body, but I noticed that it tends to droop forward when I'm wearing it, thus the small chain links hanging down from it don't sit properly. Or, the chain link parts often wrap around the main piece. Again, it's beautiful in theory, but you might want to be aware that it may not sit exactly as it looks in the photo."
3.0,"These pants run a little small.<br />I got size 10 for my 7 year old who wears size 10 in everything, and they were too short.<br />The material feels almost like a nylon to me.<br />I ended up donating these."
3.0,"Didn’t come like picture, cute just doesn’t fit right"
3.0,I found another dress oike this one at department store for a few more dollars that was real clothing quality. Not just something  to wear for a costume. So I returned this one.
3.0,There are better memes than this i wouldnt pay 3 dollars for it.
3.0,I like it. It is decent quality
3.0,I usually buy my rings from Piercing Pagoda in the mall but I thought I'd give an Amazon purchase a try. I wasn't happy with this purchase. It didn't look as nice in person as on the site. The stones looked rather cheap and the silver post was a shiny plastic finish that looked like it could chip. The dangling stones were stiff not flexible so it jutted out in an awkward way. I returned it and will resume purchasing at PP.
3.0,"This bra is very comfortable to wear.  I have large breasts & my only complaint is that the support is not the best, straps are thin & it is too stretchy."
3.0,Very cute look but the material is cheap and stains very easily.
3.0,"Not the best material, but I guess it's fair for what you pay. I personally wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,Flimsier than I thought but wearing on beach so it’s fine
3.0,It is extremely cute & what I wanted but it's so big it falls off my heel ... Wish there was a way to tighten it because it absolutely adorable ... Not worth sending back .. Just going pay it forward at the festival I'll be at on Wed ...
3.0,Long fingers
3.0,"The quality was fine, but the fit was way to wide in the arms and also a bit large in the chest"
3.0,"Shirt is fine, but stripes almost look like optical illusion. Gave me a headache... lol"
3.0,Fits a lot smaller then expected. Good gag gift. Fiancé got a good laugh.
3.0,"it's not too comfortable but you'll get used to it, and it can be adjusted if you put enough pressure inwards or outwards (probably because it's cheap but yk)"
3.0,This portfolio is nice and holds all size currencies like a dream but it only holds up to 30 bills. It is not in a binder format so unfortunately no more pages can be added. Wish it was made with more pages but decent for the price.
3.0,Unable to use due to being the wrong size.
3.0,"Love the whole idea behind this dress. But reordering going up two additional sizes. I read all posts but couldn't handle budges. 42dd weight under 200. Trying 5x. Can't handle restrictions,<br />Have to be comfortable and the girls hated confinement with a 3x(usually wear 1x)<br />Ps I can sew so will adjust accordingly"
3.0,doesnt fit very well
3.0,"Really cute, just a tad too tight..lots of compliments, however.  comfortable,"
3.0,"Not satin or any quality material, can still see through a bit due to Thiness of material, not really best quality but works well enough, pretty cheaply made for price."
3.0,"These shoes are alright, they get the job done.  The laces are a bit of a problem, you never really feel like the shoe is completely secured to your foot.  If you attempt to tighten the laces, the laces will snap.  Had to buy new laces.  Would not buy again."
3.0,No greenish at all. It is only White. Not much change in color like other opals of different colors.  I will give them to my daughter. She does not have any opals
3.0,"With a stretch type string holding this together I don't really expect this bracelet to last a long time, but for the price I have an inexpensive but genuine piece of jewelry to add to my collection.  It goes well with casual everyday denim apparel. It's a good buy for the price."
3.0,"I just got this in the mail yesterday. From this picture it looks slightly rustic and more 3-D. Picture will be posted soon, but it's actually  bright silver and the flowers aren't as dimensional. I give it an even ok and if it wasn't $3, I'd return it..I've learned from past experience that it can cost up to $13 to mail back something that costs $3-$4, so why bother. That picture looks better than it does in person. For an adult, you won't be upset if you pass on it."
3.0,"Cute necklace, received lots of compliments when I wore it! Sadly, the clasp broke off after one day of use. Lucky for me I had gorilla glue on hand to fix it."
3.0,"The necklace is very cute, but within 5 minutes of my daughter wearing it, it broke. The clasp that connects the necklace had come apart and my husband had to fix it with pliers. Hopefully now that it is super tight, the clasp wont come apart."
3.0,I would order a have size up
3.0,Cut for teeny tiny people!!
3.0,"Imagine the cheapest reusable bag you can find, then print the store logo on it upside down. That’s what you’re purchasing with this product. I gave it three stars because of the variety and because my kids still have fun playing with them. Eff it, they can’t read yet anyway, so it doesn’t bother them that the word is printed upside down and they’ve got a stethoscope hanging upward, defying gravity. Just be warned..."
3.0,The laces are small and tight.
3.0,"The color was nice, but the bust area was a little large on me. Also the tabs to hold the buttons were white and they showed when the top was worn. If someone was a little large in the bust, it would have fit fine. I think I needed a cross between large and extra large."
3.0,See through. But cheap enough!
3.0,Nice but it pinches.
3.0,Cheap looking.  Get what cha pay for.
3.0,I should have sized down. I ordered a small but it bulges at the stomach area and makes me look pregnant. Will be returning for a smaller size
3.0,"Beautiful style and got tons of compliments on the green which I bought in M. The S fit me better but about.6” shorter than the M, which makes it too short for my 5’6 height."
3.0,Great fit but faux pockets (just flaps) and heavy stuff material.
3.0,The top keeps sliding to the back even after I tucked it in.
3.0,So big! But very cute. I was floating in the small. I returned.
3.0,Ordered a large and it was too big. Order a size down or two. Runs but in the chest and neck but very soft and looks good under a blazer and tucked in.
3.0,"The tags are kinda pokey, but can be removed with a bit of work. Once that's done they are fine."
3.0,"Not impressed, but protected my phone. I have to order more protectors."
3.0,The gloves are not totally waterproof. Spent 4 hours shoveling during the snow storm and outside the gloves were absorbing the snow as it melted. The inside of the gloves were damp from my hands sweating. This became a problem when removing the gloves.
3.0,Love the dress but it falling apart the first time I wear it....<br /><br />I'll think about buying from them again!
3.0,much more comfortable than normal compression socks but that is bc they are not compressing as much
3.0,The colors look a little different then I thought. The texture wasn't as great either.
3.0,"This top is cuter than I expected.  When I took it out of the package it looked baggy and unappealing.  But I tried it on and it fit well and looks pretty cute on.  I normally wear a 20-22, and I got the largest size (I think 3x), and that fits me.  There are some flaws in the shirt:  the hem is not even in the front, the material is very thin, and it's definitely see through, even though I bought a dark color to try to avoid that.  But the unevenness is within acceptable limits for my taste, and I'm willing to wear a cami under it, so it works out.  It's a cute, casual shirt, that I don't expect to last long, because I doubt the material will hold up to very many washings."
3.0,"So I've had this bag about 2-3 weeks now. The bottom of the bag is a sturdy shiny harder &#34;leather&#34;. The upper tiers have almost a suede look to them in person. This is a nice deep bag, plenty of space. Inside the interior is a goldish color, there is your standard zipper pocket on one side and the sewn in double pocket on the other. The sewing looks nice and neat, no fraying fabric sticking out. The straps are really easy to snap on and off. I'm a shorter girl so I admit the long strap is too long for me, so I only use the shorter one. The only thing I'd like to see different is some sort of magnetic or button snap to hold the bag closed. Other then that, this is a beautiful purse with plenty of space and I'd certainly<br /><br />Update: Having had this bag and using it on an off for a few months, the strap came off from the inside of the bag. Deducting two points for it because I expect a long lasting product."
3.0,"I wear a size 4. When I bought this skirt, I ordered a medium to compensate for what I thought would compensate for Asian-made clothing running small.  The skirt was ridiculously tight. Every undergarment line and twitching leg muscle was blatantly visible. Extremely unflattering. I am returning it and ordering a large. I hope it fits!! It looks like a nice skirt but if you think the midi length is modest for a work environment, think again and order 2 sizes up!"
3.0,"Run really small, more a kids size."
3.0,I really wanted to like this. The dress is cute but beware there is no tassle on the backside. Also the fabric is very fitting so it hugs any rolls your body may have especially with no tassle on the backside to help cover. The dress runs a little small too.
3.0,I like the look it’s just to big for ne
3.0,Cute but a pink tan color. Washed out my daughters face so I returned it. Super cute otherwise.
3.0,Not as large as I thought they would be
3.0,"Even with Prime shipping I'll probably not buy another of these - these straps are WAAAY too long, even after shrinking in the laundry. I'm petite but I'd have to be 6'3&#34; for these straps to not need a couple of inches taken off. The quality of the shirt is decent, inferior to Vermont Country Store's famous undershirts but of acceptable quality: not as soft and a wee bit thinner than VCS, plus there's a seam right in the middle of the straps where the two pieces of ribbing that form the straps meet (instead of having that seam on the garment body) so that's a bit tacky.<br /><br />An okay value for this hard-to-find style but I'd rather get the kind that have lasted me for 25-plus years ... even though I probably don't have 25-plus years left on me. ;)"
3.0,"I like the bag even though the color is much darker than the picture. I would call it a dark mauve not pink. Also, the handles totally ruin the purse. Very cheap looking. Not leather!"
3.0,"These do NOT work on toddler crocs, the posts are too big for the holes. They work on little and big kids’ sizes but NOT toddler size. My 2 year old grandson was so excited when they arrived but they weren’t able to put them on his shoes… big disappointment."
3.0,"My son loves the necklace. I was expecting 2 necklaces (""Double Dog Tag"") but didn't realize the description meant 1 necklace that is double-sided."
3.0,"If you've got curves, it's a little snug across the bust.  I needed to stitch the buttons closed because they kept popping open."
3.0,"It was an average squishy not as slow rising as I expected it to be, low key kinda cheap but I guess thats what i get for buying a CHEAP item. I would not reccomend this item also one con is that its very prone to rips. My dog ate one third of it. I had to bring both the dog and squishy to the hospital."
3.0,"These are super cute socks, but they just don't compare to my Sockwell compression socks. The material is pretty thin and doesn't seem as sturdy or heavy and doesn't provide really any cushion on my feet. Like I said, they're probably the cutest ones I own, but there are better socks out there."
3.0,It's not slim fit as it looks
3.0,top fit great. bottoms were much smaller in comparison to the tops portioning
3.0,Love this suit. Only complaint is the top is only tie. It doesn’t hold me in well enough. I tried double knots but it just slowly loosens until I am exposed.
3.0,"Some of these pins are not legit, still a good price and tradeable.  No duplicates.  Just know you aren't getting 100% legit product."
3.0,Returning.  To small and I don't like the fabric feel.
3.0,"i got this sunglasses today and the are really huge, but the shipping was really fast , i dont know i guess i can still wear them but kinda to big for me, maybe someone else would like that tho !!"
3.0,"I had to alter the sleeves. I like to wear belts with this kind of blouse so it being big was not a problem except in the sleeves. Apparently if you are bigger your arms are the size of tree trunks, because that is the size of the elastic cuffs. Had to alter them so they fit."
3.0,it wasnt as long as i expected
3.0,"Comfortable  suit, perfect for family vacations with the kids. Cute enough to walk around in with a wrap."
3.0,dress did not fit me well
3.0,cord untied after a few days
3.0,Pretty but the clasps were bent when I got them. Had to bend back and didn't look right afterward.
3.0,"Update - the seller reached out to me asking if I would try the band again if they sent me a new one - promising some changes were made.  They sent it out promptly - I installed it and so far so good.  The connecting clasp actually looks and feels stronger.  So far so good.  I really do like the look and feel of the band.  (original post) So this is the second time I ordered this band - loved the way it looked, felt, fit.  First one, the connection broke but returned it and re-ordered it.  This time it looked like it would last, but, alas, broke in the same way.  Piece that connected to the watch - screws fell out, no longer able to connect.  And, I am 2 weeks past return window  Ugh...."
3.0,Barely covers tummy. It can only be worn tucked into waistband.
3.0,Me llego con un pequeño defecto
3.0,"I returned this purchase and the seller refunded me immediately. I have no issues with the seller. They did a good job getting it to me and refunding promptly. The fit was off on these capris. I wear a small and they were too big. The color was definitely orange, not coral . There is a difference."
3.0,"I ordered my normal size of large.  It should be marked “gigantic” because it is WAY too large.  It also, strangely, has threads hanging off of it all over the place that I keep having to cut off as they are still attached.  Definitely less quality than expected.  The size issue is the biggest problem so I’m hoping to shrink it enough to be wearable in the wash."
3.0,First let me say that what I received was of good quality. The picture shows a pre tied bow tie. I received a bow tie that required manual tieing. Your ad should be changed to show what you are really selling. I kept the set because the scarf matches other omega accessories.
3.0,face got super-sweaty wearing this.  Will save it for trip to Antarctica someday.
3.0,It's not really what I expected. It came from China. It is a shiny material.  Not high quality.
3.0,"Outside is beautiful. However, the liner is cheap looking and feeling."
3.0,Very thin. Can't get much inside. Good if you want to carry just a card or two in your pocket
3.0,"Ordered my usual size. This bra fits fine, feels very comfortable. For large cup size the non-stretch straps are essential, however, unfortunately the cup material is stretchy and gives too much “bounce” - not enough structure for office wear. Because it’s so comfy & inexpensive, I decided to keep it to wear w a hoodie or around the house. Still searching for that perfect bra that I don’t think exists. 😒"
3.0,"It’s a nice bag. Does have. Funny smell. It’s also not as big as it appears. It only comfortably fit a laptop, charge and wallet and it still may not zip closed. It’s a nice bag but I wanted it as a school tote."
3.0,"When I first saw the product, I loved it! the cool patterns and nice compartments had me buy it in a minute. I packed it up for a 5 day trip to New Orleans and it was very convenient until i noticed a dreadful malfunction. The zipper was not closing anything; it was just moving without zipping. I tried tugging on it while holding both sides of the opening but the metal piece of the zipper completely broke off! I would recommend this if it was properly made."
3.0,"It was a little tight and conservative around the tush, and loose around the top/bustline.  It was really pretty if I had a smaller butt and bigger boobs maybe?  But for a proportionate body, it didn't really fit quite right.  :S"
3.0,I wear them and they are ok.  They aren't very big or very bright.
3.0,Its A'ight.
3.0,"They were presented as waterproof, however my daughter had to exchange them when shoveling snow as they leaked."
3.0,Not at all as flattering as the other pattyboutik items I've purchased. Over priced for the quality.
3.0,"The hems were crooked and you could tell they ran out of fabric on the tie at the top because they literally just sloppily sewed more onto it and the whole strap is comedically crooked -- that said, you can hardly tell when you've got the shirt on and tied up. It's cheap and cheaply made, but you do get what you pay for."
3.0,Clasp too hard to open
3.0,Very cute but very stiff and itchy
3.0,"Beautiful bag, however the smell was something serious I aired it for a few days, but that didn't help much. I will be returning."
3.0,Had to return as was too small
3.0,"The mask isn't as pictured. The ears turn down awkwardly. Also, the mask does not fit well. I constantly had to adjust it on my face. I gave up on it halfway to the event."
3.0,"For quality and style I would have given this leotard 5 stars. Unfortunately, it was way too large for my child. Overall my daughter is an average sized 3 year old. If anything I’ve had people tell me she is on the tall side. Even so this leotard was still way too long for her. There is no way this leo could ever fit a 2 year old or even most 3 year olds. If anything I’d say it was between 4t-5t. With that being said if possible I would have sized down because it was adorable and seemed to be good quality. Thankfully it arrived quickly so I could try it out and still have time to get something else and has free returns for prime members."
3.0,"I didn't like the dress , personally. I think it Seems cheaply made. Very stretchy and  clingy material  which definitely did not flatter me too well.  ;)"
3.0,"As far as quality goes, I don't really have any concerns.  It feels sturdy and weighty.  I only have two concerns: A) the links have rather sharp edges and are not rounded at all; this is very uncomfortable on the skin. B) The rounded end piece is a little short and does not really reach the body of the watch, and creates an unattractive gap (pictured).  I'm going to continue searching for a more comfortable, better fitting replacement band."
3.0,Very cheap flimsy material.  There is no way a bathing suit will fit under it even for the thinnest woman because the material is thin. Item was returned with no problem. Seller very cooperative so I gave it 2 more stars
3.0,This is okay but the results are mouth rashes and it's a nope.
3.0,Much bigger and heavier than I thought.
3.0,The material is very light weight giving the dress a cheap look.
3.0,"Pockets are too short for iPhone. Falls out whenever I sit down. Also, ends are frayed which I wasn’t expecting."
3.0,Already ripped on the seems
3.0,Material was of good quality
3.0,"Lasts about like the description.  Battery is on the inside, and you have to turn the battery on before you can turn the best on - clumsy to operate if you want to save battery and turn it on later or if you have it on under a coat..  Also... If you turn my vest off with the power button... It doesn't turn back on.  The power button flashes, so you have to disconnect battery pack (see above regarding location of battery pack to see how inconvenient this is) before you can turn it back on.  Not sure if this happens with others but the power switch could use some work..."
3.0,Did not like the style the fit or its material
3.0,"Necklace pendants were nice, cheap chain. I would have paid more for a nicer chain but you get what you pay for."
3.0,They are a little big. You can't really tell on line.  Hubby laughed when he first saw them.  Oh well they are good enough to keep in the car.
3.0,Too long and the it rides up into your armpits.
3.0,Bodice was tight and there was no lining.
3.0,"This purse is the perfect size, has two major parts to it where you can store stuff, and is mostly leather. I say mostly because the purse strap is only leather on the side that is visible when you wear it. Backside of the strap is fabric. Also, after a few months of use, the strap stitching came undone. I took it to a local shoe repair and they were able to stitch it up for me for under $20."
3.0,The shirt is definitely a shade of orange. I though the midsection would be tan from the picture but it’s peach. It’s soft and a nice fit though.
3.0,"The accsa Women Summer Straw Bucket Hat Sun is a nice foldable hat to wear when working in the yard or lazing around on a summer's day. The hat has a nice brim that extends outward with a wire around the edge. This makes it easy to shape it just the way you want it to look. This is also a nice feature for those days when you are not sure you need a hat or not. The accsa hat can be flattened and thrown in your day pack, then pulled out if needed.<br /><br /> It is made of 50% cotton and 50% linen with an open weave that allows your head to breathe. A nice feature for those hot summer days with one exception; it doesn't really provide protection from the sun's rays on your face. You will still need sun screen on your face and nose when you wear this hat.<br /><br />This is a fairly affordable foldable summer hat that comes in an assortment of colors and really looks cute. At the current price of $16.99 I think it is a fair deal. I am not sure I would call it a bargain, but that is for you to decide. I knocked off 1 star for the pricing and 1 star for the lack of UV protection. You may disagree with me here, but that is my assessment. As always, I hope this review will help others with their shopping decision."
3.0,"These are VERY small...The red color is light red...much lighter and MUCH small than expected...these would be perfect for a child, not an adult. They are pretty just small..."
3.0,Zipper zips on the opposite side compared to other men's jackets.
3.0,"The top is very soft, but has long arms and structure is lacking."
3.0,Set it back. To small in the sleves
3.0,"I started purchasing 'specifically' Gloria Vanderbilt jeans way back in the middle 1990's.  I must have almost ten pair of her jeans. However; when I received 'this' pair, they were not made correctly for they were too tight and I know I purchased the correct size.  I believe 'this pair' slipped through the cracks for I know these are well made jeans.  I strongly suggest you look at this product review as an isolated incident due to the fact I will continue to purchase Gloria's Amanda jeans. The taped leg and classic rise is great for us girls that have height and weight in proportion.  I always order the average size 12 with the 31 inch length since I wear lots of boots.  Just do your homework and consider the competitors :)."
3.0,"a lttle small in 2mm, not too good in quality  needed to be a bit wider to show the stones"
3.0,It is very comfortable and I really like the style.  Only wish I had ordered down one size
3.0,Short and fits more like a T-shirt and less like a dress
3.0,"Very nice quality, was just too big :)"
3.0,"So cute! Not a sweatshirt, more like a silk over sweatshirt material. I’d say the Large fits about a size 6, maybe 4."
3.0,These fit very strange
3.0,"Good for the price. I wear a size 8 Converse/Adidas or a size 7 1/2 at Payless and these slippers were a 9.5-10 Large.<br />My mom wears a 7 and has a wicked bunion and needed some help pushing the slipper on but it worked out okay once on.<br />If I saw these in a store for $10  I don't think I'd buy them, though."
3.0,"The watch and band are very pretty and the watch is keeping correct time at this point.  The magnetic band is nice, but it opens very easily.  I am hoping I won't lose it."
3.0,Love the pockets but WHY CAN'T THINGS FIT THE SAME?
3.0,Beautiful when first purchased but black coating started to chip
3.0,Rather uncomfortable.
3.0,"Thin material -see through and looks easy to fray after a few washes. Not as flattering if you have a larger than B-cup. The front buttons down with &#34;rubber-band&#34; type loops, which pull open and necessitate wearing another dress underneath. Then you loose that nice flowing look :(<br />I ordered a Med and am 5'8&#34; 140#. Maybe I should have got an XL for the flowy look. Otherwise would have to wear as an accent piece."
3.0,isnt as bright as expected. still pretty cool
3.0,Los talles son muy chicos
3.0,Basically a long teeshirt
3.0,"They just aren't very comfortable.  Maybe if I was diver used to wearing neoprene I wouldn't feel this way, but I put them on and my feet instantly felt like they were in some foreign place.  After wearing them for a day in mostly dry conditions, my feet were rather damp... which means that if you have sweaty pig feet like me that they'll stay sweaty in these beasts."
3.0,"For me they ran too large. I am 5’6” and normally wear a 22 so I got the 20/22 and they were very loose on the legs and bunched up. The waist fit but also felt loose. I ended up returning them but if I were to order I again I would size down. The inside felt nice and soft but the material outside wasn’t what I was expecting, it was kind of slick and had a bit of shine to it."
3.0,kind of strange in the legs
3.0,"This seems like a nice comfy robe, it was just too big."
3.0,I love them but they are super thin. I had to buy some black shorts to go under them.
3.0,Pendant is heavy and chain doesn't seem to go so well with pendant.  Chain is too light for pendant
3.0,My 4 year old loves them we were a little disappointed that the middle pink stone looks clear like the rest.
3.0,"Top fit fine, bottoms are tight around my kid's small waist"
3.0,Super difficult to get on. I understand that they are compression and should be tight but these were insanely tight.
3.0,It's a nice shirt but the threading around the edges are not done perfectly and some seem frayed. After trimming those long pieces the shirt looked better but still not seen perfect. It's what I would expect from a 12$ shirt.
3.0,I am pleased with the fit and style but not impressed with the fabric
3.0,Its nice just rises really high up on the sides
3.0,"Mask looks great and fits fine, but wears a little heavy and the covered part of the face heats up quickly."
3.0,"After reading reviews, I was really excited for this dress. However, the top fit my very strangely. I have a fuller bust so if anything I thought it would be too tight, but there was a weird gap on the sides. Had the top fit, I would have kept it. The bodice and skirt were nice, though I wish they were lined."
3.0,Short but cute for the concept
3.0,Product is nice but size runs small
3.0,So cute and durable!!
3.0,Seam came across breast.
3.0,Great idea but after a month they came off.  :-(
3.0,Cute dress on the hanger but once i put it on i didn’t like it.
3.0,A little stiff and sizes run small
3.0,We're not formed same on both sides so didn't fit my face right 🤔
3.0,"Cheap, but looks nice,"
3.0,"It's a nice sweater, kind of brighter color than I expected but I think it will be useful so I'll keep it."
3.0,lots of duplicate colors and only one black no white.
3.0,The fabric is so poor! I didn’t like! But fit well !
3.0,It was way too big around for a woman. Trying to figure out how to make it smaller.
3.0,"This is a fun piece of costume jewelry. The simulated moonstone is pretty, but it's just a oval bead. Not an actual stone."
3.0,"They do the job,  sturdy and easy to transport. However, they are smaller than I anticipated, not much bigger than a regular plastic supermarket bag. Maybe once I fill them several times the bags will stretch out and hold more."
3.0,Fits weird. Got these for working out and the material is not what I expected. Don’t like em at all
3.0,"Very gorgeous ring, however the bottom fins stab when I bend or move the wrong way. Granted I do have a small navel, just beware! :)"
3.0,Idea is good but they run very small. I can wear with flip flops but any other shoes underneath and they are too small. I wear a women’s size 7 1/2
3.0,"I thought it would be a little more flattering. I’m 5’9, 150lbs and I ordered a size medium."
3.0,"Ok for price. Material is thin and kind of see through; which I don’t care for. Will still use, just with shorts or tights."
3.0,Not a fan. The material feels like some sort of swim material it’s so weird and the fit definitely runs small.
3.0,"First, the socks don't seem like a compression sock to me. As regular socks, they are fine, but they don't seem to fit like a compression sock. Second, there's no sizing. I wear a women's 9.5, so these ""should fit"", but the heel is way off and stretches to my ankle. OK for socks, if you wear at least a men's 9, these might work, but wouldn't buy as a compression sock. Unlike others, I got exactly the colors that I ordered, so that's a plus, at least."
3.0,"I originally wanted to give two stars, but there are much crappier shirts out there. But my most important note here would be that this tank top is NOT form-fitting, like the photos portray it to be. I would compare them to Walmart band tshirts, or maybe just a small step below. If you have a printer & an iron at home, you could very easily make this tshirt yourself at half of the price-perhaps even less. If you do choose to purchase this tank, I just suggest being very careful about how you wash it, because the picture will crumble apart after a while. I suggest washing with cold water with a gentle detergent on a gentle setting, then either hanging to dry or throw it in the dryer on tumble/air dry. I personally may just cut mine up to give more of that rocker feel, or sew myself a new pillow."
3.0,"I expected the bar to be longer so to pin the point of the shirts down, doesn't get the job done"
3.0,"I am 5'9&#34;, approx 145 lbs. Per the reviews, I ordered an XL (I'm normally an 8-10 in pants, a medium in tops). Let me tell you - people aren't kidding when they say this is TIGHT. That elastic is just unforgiving. I'm trying to find an outfit for my cousin's wedding and I just don't see how this could be comfortable all night.<br />It's very disappointing - this color is fantastic.The length was really wonderful too. I felt like a princess - if only it weren't so tight!!"
3.0,"My bracelet arrived quickly and I love it. However, it smells horrible.  I saw on another review that the smell goes away in a few days.  I sure hope it does, because there is no way I can wear this with that stench!  It's pretty bad!"
3.0,"I got the small size and they are still big. Since they are super stretchy, they still fit. For me, there is way too much fabric in the calves and they are loose at the bottoms so it looks awkward if I try to fold them under. The colors are cute and true to the picture. If I do wear them to the gym, it would be on a day doing upper body. They are squat proof as well and very soft."
3.0,"Fashion, costume jewelry. Materials could be better. Earring stones made of cheap plastic glass."
3.0,"switch a little janky, but not bad for the money"
3.0,The bra fit me but I'm very small chested so it may not work on someone with a larger bust. I've only worn it a few times and it already has a hole starting at the seam. Cheaply made.
3.0,"Very sad, within one day, the elastic band broke!!! I was so excited to get it and wish it had lasted longer... would be great if I could be sent a new one!!!"
3.0,"While the idea of these pants is cute, the execution needs a little help. I like the length, rise & I love the super soft fabric. But the run small & the soft fabric is on the sheer side & when they’re a little tighter in spots, it exacerbated the see-throughness (yes, I just created a new word to describe it). Even with their faults, since the price is reasonable & they are so comfortable, I kept them."
3.0,Mask is smaller than expected and fit me extremely tight to the point of being very uncomfortable.
3.0,"I ordered this in off-white after seeing a TikTok, but it was so sheer that I couldn’t wear it out. Returned"
3.0,Needed a size 8 fits a bit small just go one size bigger
3.0,"Cute, but the strap does not sit right around and is uncomfortable"
3.0,"Package arrived on time, fit was odd and not complimentary but the fabric had a nice stretch and weight to it. Returned it with out any issues."
3.0,It’s a cute anklet but it’s very uncomfortable the way it sits and it constantly twist on itself so you have to adjust constantly.
3.0,"I recommend getting a size up. They run small. One pair was tighter than the rest. I was disappointed. They fit like teen sizes in clothes, which is weird since they're basically socks."
3.0,eh...
3.0,"Fit was okay, material extremely thin so for me it would require something underneath. The description says “black” stripes...it’s definitely NOT black. It’s more gray/blue and purple stripes - it’s pretty but not what I need - returning."
3.0,The cut is great. The beige color is a little see through. The stitching by the label is very annoying and digs in skin.
3.0,These are pretty nice goggles. I kind of feel like my vision becomes blurrier with them on. But I like the clip on the back. Makes it easier to take them off.
3.0,Sad to say not as well made and the color was not as expected.
3.0,The knees are articulated and ruched - they hit an awkward spot and are too short for tall people (like me)
3.0,The arm snapped in half really easily.
3.0,SHOULD HAVE ORDERED A MEDIUM SIZE BUT STILL LIKE THIS PRODUCT.
3.0,It's ok.  The chain is questionable because it may turn color as it exposes to air.  I'm going to leave it hanging out for a couple of weeks to see if color gets dull or not and will re rate this product accordingly.
3.0,"Although I love the look of it I can't get it to stay tight on my wrist. The pull string loosens up too easily so I don't wear it as often as I would like. I already had a bracelet with a pull string closure so I thought this one would be OK. Not the case, unfortunately."
3.0,"Anklet is beautiful, however, didn't realize it'd be so thin.  Love it anyway."
3.0,3 stars because necklace is quite cheap.  Broke first day.  Was washing my face and the hand towel snagged on the necklace just lightly.  The gem itself is quite beautiful.  It was a gift so I'll just replace the chain.
3.0,They are charming but way too big for my adult head. They won't stay in place as a face mask.
3.0,"It is hard to keep this in place when I am actively working around the house, etc. It comes untucked while I am cleaning, etc. I will keep them so that I at least have a little help with the sweat in this area while the weather is so hot and humid."
3.0,"fit and style is good. no fan fair here, it just a regular black dress that can give you cover if you're needing something ""easy"" to wear in a pinch."
3.0,Clasp does not secure every time.
3.0,This is just a sweatshirt the picture makes it look like a more feminine jacket
3.0,It works but is a little feminine. Looks a little cheap.
3.0,This didn't fit me as well as I thought. I took measurements and made sure they were appropriate but its still a lovely piece of jewelry. I did break it however in the first day I wore it. It can easily get caught on things in the house and isn't that durable which causes damages easily.
3.0,Runs large. Wish I had bought a size smaller. I am taking in the sides.
3.0,"I received this bracelet and although I like it , it was missing one of the gold beaded bracelets. I sent an e-mail but got no response. I wear it anyway, though."
3.0,"I ordered an XL for my future husband and a large for my self. The size is good but they are really long. I could have gone a size down. I also ordered a black one for him which is super nice. I own a lot of black tees and I don't like white so I ordered myself the gray one. It's not really gray, more of a dingy off-white."
3.0,"This is a fashion statement. It's not going to protect you from the sun or rain. It has adjustable sizing with the plastic sizer at the back of the hat.  Two-thirds of the hat, the back part of the hat, is a black mesh, with the front two sections being a shiny black leather-like material. The front two sections and the bill are the shiny leather-like black material. The bill is very stiff, so it sits pretty much straight across the forehead. The very back of the hat in white stitching are the words, 'about last night.' and the writing cannot be easily removed."
3.0,I suggest a size up.
3.0,It’s such a cute dress and very flattering. However the blue color I got is super sheer and this is an unlined dress. Had to wear nude shorts and bra to make it look acceptable.
3.0,"Good overall but for the price I expected better materials. Case in fancy though, but the main article should be the eye glasses itself, not the case."
3.0,Gold Fitbit holder but silver clasp? Really
3.0,Pretty on the model.
3.0,"She absolutely loves this outfit.  She wants to wear it often.  It’s so loved that I may have to get her the next size up for when she outgrows it (which will be soon).<br /><br />I fear I will forever be haunted by the fact that the right leg is 1/2” shorter than the left and that face turns towards the inside of her knee, especially if the next one has the same issue with the legs."
3.0,"I purchased this “dress” for my daughter’s 3rd birthday party. It arrived late but it was okay because I had a couple of options for her already. I purchased the largest size for her and I’m glad I did because when it arrived it was not a dress, but more of a blouse.<br /><br />I want to clarify that the “dress” fit her arms, shoulder, and chest. It was, however, too small lengthwise.<br /><br />I wasn’t upsetting at all because  it’s very cute and my daughter absolutely LOVES the item. It is a bit sheer so I would suggest to have a tank top or shirt underneath. When I dress my daughter, I do have her wear a shirt underneath."
3.0,"The top looked great. But due to the cut under the arms and at the side (bat-wing cut), whenever I raised my arms, the entire top raised up. And the torso is short. I returned it. Maybe a top without sleeves would work."
3.0,A bit on the thin side and the pocket zippers are flimsy but I still love this jacket.
3.0,I recieved my watch a few days earlier than the delivery date which was nice. I absolutely love it! It has a few scratches but nothing too serious. The only other issue is the smaller hand is slightly fast but I'm sure it's fixable. Overall a well spent purchase.
3.0,The color is beautiful. The fabric feels nice to the touch and soft on. I'm disappointed that there is no hole on either side to wrap the dress strings through!!  I can sew so I'll fix it but no one should have to repair a new dress. I'll also have to snip off a few threads and extra on the lace.  It's comfortable and flattering even for an apple shaped woman.
3.0,Broke soon.
3.0,"I wanted to like this, but the lace just looks SO incredibly cheap that I can't wear it with anything.  I try to pair it with outfits and always end up putting it back in the drawer.  I agree with other reviewers that the fabric is very soft, so that is worth a few stars.  Just not my cup of tea."
3.0,Cups don't lay flat. If I turn or bend the wrong way one of the cups gaps too much! Wish I would have returned it before wearing it to the pool.
3.0,Really short. Would recommend sizing up
3.0,Too tick to fit through the nose ring hole I intended
3.0,"I am 6'0&#34; and 215 lbs.  I ordered an XL.  It was way, way too small.<br />The fabric is nice, however, and the fleece(?) inside is very soft.<br />So... very good quality; order it a size up."
3.0,"This is okay. It's soft and looks just like the picture, but it hangs very loosely on the body so there's not a lot of shape to it (I'm 5'4&#34;, 120lbs, 34b). I just didn't like the way it looked on me, returned it."
3.0,Wrist straps need improvement
3.0,Love the cur and color but stitching wasnt done well.
3.0,Smaller than it appears in the photo.
3.0,"the inner seam are not trimmed well and wallets the correct size or of any girth will catch.  I bought a slim credit card wallet and it catches on the inner linings.  I like the clutch but unfortunately just a tad small, or needs cleanup on the liners."
3.0,THE DRESS WAS CUTE BUT TOO SMALL
3.0,Necklace amulet falls off the necklace constantly when the necklace elastic gets stretched out. Pretty annoying but otherwise you get what you pay for!
3.0,"The legs were very wide, just an awkward fit. Didn’t look as pictured."
3.0,"I didn't dislike it enough to return it, I will use it....but a medium is on the small side in my opinion."
3.0,"Works well to prop collar up but fit isn’t precise as the tips stick out and are visible (had to break the edges off). Could be because I wear predominately spread collars, not sure."
3.0,Does its job at holding the weights and looks quite snazzy. But the latch is really really tight and I constantly feel like I'm gonna hurt my fingers when I delatch it.
3.0,It outer zips came off already.
3.0,The dress is longer than exoected. It goes below my knee. I am 5’3”
3.0,"Cute dress! Although the shiny and thin fabric is just as you would imagine... very thin. No hems, just a free edge, and kind of in the tight side."
3.0,"My daughter really likes these sandals, but for some reason they keep sending us the wrong size. She’s currently wears an 8 with a little room to grow. I ordered a size 8 toddler. The first pair was 24 months so I exchanged. The second pair was also labeled 24 months but were bigger than the previous. Still too small though so I returned them and now ordered a 9.5 toddler. Fingers crossed a sandal that actually fits her shows up. Overall the quality seems decent for a sandal."
3.0,Not finest as on the picture.
3.0,"I love the colors - the fit is so-so as the material does stretch, but not nearly as much as some others I have. My biggest complaint is the seam that runs the length of the sleeve; its a significant seam and being a compression sleeve, I found it very uncomfortable.  I prefer a softer and ""stretchier"" material."
3.0,"It was a little bigger then expected, fits very loose"
3.0,"Good idea, but for me with my glasses and the nose piece on the visor removed I felt it was a little loose. I almost knocked them off my face by touching a corner while I was talking. When I tried them on, with the nose piece on, the visor fit. The gradient grey color is nice, and the shield isn’t so large that it’s overwhelming. It comes in a box, but my shield had a scuff on it because the box is too tight so not enough padding to protect the shield surface."
3.0,Beautiful but they are bigger than advertised. These are not for little girls.
3.0,"I love the dress, but it runs WAY to small.  I normally wear a large top, but I couldn't get my arms into this dress.  Very disappointing since it is a cute dress."
3.0,The part with stones is only 3 inches while the whole thing is too long. Sparkly but not practical. One side of the chain gets stuck and cannot move freely.
3.0,It was cute. I bought this for my boyfriend for xmas. But its a bit snug on his head.
3.0,Does cut down on the glare but the vision is a little blurred. This is due to my vision problems so I should have ordered clip ons instead
3.0,The shaft of the earring could be longer but in all they are good.
3.0,I like the design but runs small.
3.0,"Just received these, so my review might change once I've worn them for any length of time, but a couple of things you might want to consider. One the plus side, they were pretty much made as I expected for. the price, the cotton drawstring bag is really cute and reusable, and the black and olive are true to color. On the minus side, the tangerine, which I interpret as orange, is really light brown, the yellow, which I really wanted, is actually a green/yellow or chartreuse, and so won't match. Additionally, they are really stretching it (no pun intended) when they say this will fit up to size 9, as I am an 8 1/2 and they are quite snug, which makes me concerned that they will tear easily over time. They are on the thin side and don't look that sturdy but let's see how they hold up; they may surprise me. Overall, I feel they are a good buy if you're looking for certain unusual colors (I wanted the olive, orange, and yellow, so a third-happy). One weirdness: that cute cotton drawstring bag, with a tag that says ""we really don't like plastic"", came in not one but two hard-to-open plastic bags :)."
3.0,The dress looks nice but is thin material. It has no lining and the sticking near the zipper was not done well.
3.0,Wish I had gotten next size up. Almost too tight for my grandson  but it might work for a months or two
3.0,"These look cute BUT they show a slight discoloration although they are brand new, which makes me question their 925 stamping (as shown in pictures).<br /><br />Also, they are slightly difficult to put on because of the swirl design, and in my case my ears are very sensitive, which means that they turn red easily. After the hassle of putting them on, they do look nice!<br /><br />Unsure if I'd recommend this purchase, tho!"
3.0,I'm not impressed with this item.  I do like the sleeves i think that's neat but its smaller then i thought. I ordered a size up hoping for a loose easy something to throw on during the summer that still looked cute. Well if i wanted to loose some weight this would work.  Its super tight on the bottom and no where near as loose as i was hoping on the top.  I guess just to throw over my swim suit top in the event i need to run to the store it will do ok but as far as wearing it to dinner like i was hoping its a no
3.0,I was hoping for a mask that would be fun to wear to a concert but the fit is pretty uncomfortable and the white background can show up unless it is really dark.
3.0,The first day I used this purse the over-the-shoulder strap clip BROKE! The bag is very nice but the hardware is cheap!
3.0,One of them came missing a couple hooks so I couldn't use it.
3.0,The white lining along the exterior is not as fluffy as it looks in the photos.<br />It’s made of a thinner fabric than i expected.<br />Color is a very bright red rather than the darker velvet color pictured
3.0,"I am 5'4"", 160 lbs and am apple body shaped/carry most of my weight in my midsection. I typically wear a medium or large in bottoms (I like things loose and since my mid section in my biggest area, I like to get things big). I ordered these in an XL based on the size chart.<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered up a size. Right out of the package they fit nicely, or maybe a little loose. So I would think most people would want to order up one size.<br /><br />The khaki color is way more yellow than the pictures looked like, but I still really like the color. They are really comfortable and lightweight.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is they shrunk length wise quite a bit in the wash. I should have air dried but I totally didn't think about it and put them in a dryer on medium low heat. I would say they lost about three inches in length but the waist didn't shrink (because of the elastic?). They still work, but now they are ankle length rather than kind of long the way I liked them. I am keeping them and will wear them casually around, but I definitely recommend for others NOT to dry them with any heat. Just wash on cold then air dry.<br /><br />I'm posting pics of before and after the shrinkage."
3.0,"I ordered the (2)  4 Pack - Black CharmLeaks Womens cotton underwear bikini hipster panties<br /><br />I found the fit to be inconsistent.  One pack they all fit the same but the second pack had two pairs that were WAY to tight.<br /><br />The pack that did fit, I found were nice, they were soft and washed well."
3.0,"These skirts were cute for a Bollyfit we performed. Tight at the waistband. But, the sequins are not sewed on securely. We shed them all over the stage."
3.0,"It's not like the one Caroline wears on the show, similar. After a few hours of wearing, the metal starts irritating my neck. This is a very pretty necklace, and I do wear it for short periods of time."
3.0,"The socks a little thin, but just what my granddaughter was looking for to wear with her sneakers.  They fit very well, but I would not classify them as athletic socks."
3.0,Love the extra length of these tanks.  Received lots of compliments especial on the vibrant colors. Will probably buy more as you can never have enough.
3.0,I really really like the looks and feel of this band!!  But the magnetic has come loose and several times and allowed the band to slip through so watch could easily fall off and did in the bed.  I regret having to return this band but not worth losing a pricey watch!
3.0,"Really cute but small. Smaller than expected, a little disappointed, but they're cute so I'm going to keep them."
3.0,Beautifull and comfortable. Fits too small.
3.0,The earrings on the picture were not the true color<br /> They were a bright orange. Nice otherwise.
3.0,"This isn't cashmere feeling at all, it's really on the scratchy side. While the design is kinda cute, it's short and even with the tail holding design wears around the neck funny.<br />I wouldn't reorder."
3.0,"I love the ring it's super cute! But the size chart is off and other comments led me to thinking I needed to go way up in size. But it was pretty big when I got it and ended up re ordering in my actual ring size. Bottom line is, if you actually know your ring size you'll be fine"
3.0,"It's a good enough necklace in itself... as described. But I bought it because it looked bright royal blue in the picture.<br /><br />The actual stones were not bright blue - they were not even navy.. they were a sort of blah/greyish blue color.<br /><br />I was not a fan, so returned.<br /><br />= great necklace as long as you're not looking for a bright/true blue color."
3.0,24 months fits like 18 months. Shirt faded after one wash in cold water & dried on low heat.
3.0,Decent quality even at the price.  Purchased for a Rocky themed party and everyone got the joke.  Walking into a non-themed costume party its questionable whether people would know it was supposed to be Sly.
3.0,Good socks but these are not the glycerin model advertised.
3.0,I ordered the ombré ones and jet black. The jet black are super cute but the Ombré ones go from dark gray to white they look more of seeing glasses vs sunglasses
3.0,"I THOUGHT THIS SWIMSUIT WAS CUTE. BUT, IT IS HARD TO GET ON AND SHEER IN THE BACK BUT THE TOP IS REALLY CUTE."
3.0,Cute. Small on wrist though. Very tight.
3.0,It seems to be a good quality shirt. But it’s definitely not a slim fit shirt.
3.0,"Does the job but is awkward for sure. Got me through 1,000 miles of rain & snow with dry gloves on a recent 6,000 plus mile trip.<br />I would hate to have seen what my trip would have been like without these. Wet gloves and 34 degrees don't mix too well."
3.0,"Cute, but they turn quickly."
3.0,Nice top. Runs very small. Medium just fit my daughter who usually wears a women’s size 2-3 or small. Washed up nice. However it’s not sweatshirt jersey material it’s more like T-shirt material.
3.0,I am a size 10/12 36DD most xxls are too big for me. The bra is for a size c cup and the bottoms fit perfect.<br /><br />I love the bottom but the top I'm just giving away.<br /><br />So the suits just OK.
3.0,Started to pill very quickly
3.0,"I use these lenses on a motorcycle helmet visor.  They are easy to apply, and magnify as claimed, but the image is not as sharp and clear as another brand of sick-on lenses I use."
3.0,The fingers didn't really move.
3.0,They were ok I suppose for lounging. But definitely not for the Gym. Very thin. And definitely not squat proof.
3.0,"OK so this suit is very cute. It is cute in person as well.<br /><br />I got the size Small. I am 5'3, I have larger breasts. The top surprisingly fits pretty well, however I am going to have to sew it tighter around rib cage. I am 29-30 inches around ribs. This top is too large in that aspect.<br /><br />Also the top on the Right side is obviously cut and sewn at an odd angle. Obviously a mistake witch makes it sit on me oddly. So I am going to try and Sew the top in hopes to fix some of that.<br /><br />Material/fabric seems ok.<br /><br />The bottoms are a fuller cut witch I like.Over all it's cute and fits well.<br />But I wonder about fabric in water and stretching..This runs on a bigger size I feel like. I may have to take in the bottoms too.<br /><br />I got the cute belly chain to go with it as well.<br />STEVE YIWU  Sell's it on AMAZON.<br /><br />I will write another update in a few months."
3.0,It’s ok...I’m horrified it will shrink when washed.
3.0,Dress was a little snug
3.0,This is cute but waaay too short to be a dress. I am 5’9” 138lbd  and bought a medium. It’s baggy in the chest and cane just below my butt. I have to wear leggings underneath.
3.0,Fit better with spanxs.
3.0,They fit as expected but the look is more like thin PJ'S. I won't be wearing them out anywhere.
3.0,These run a bit small and I ain't even got a big head. Booo...
3.0,"Shoe sizing is super weird. They run huge, basically. Not the best quality shoe."
3.0,"Wearing it only as a nightshirt because... well, because. It's a bit snug if you're chesty, but fits well otherwise."
3.0,Poor fit (short and wide). Material fine.
3.0,"Muy buena calidad, pero muy flexible y brinda poca proyección a los dispositivos electrónicos y PC."
3.0,"The boot itself is so amazing!!! And my heart really breaks to send this one back, but I wear a size 11 and it fits like a 10. This boot is everything!!! I gave 3 stars cause my hopes were let down lol. Love these boots!!"
3.0,"Returning because it was too tight in shoulders and chest. I ordered an XS. For reference I’m 5’2”, weight about 120 lb and wear a 32DD. Material wasn’t bad, would be good for late fall."
3.0,"Normally this style of hat looks great on me.  This one is just ever so slightly too small, but still works if I pull it down really hard over my head.  I have an antique hat stretcher I plan to try on it."
3.0,These look good - was hoping they would be a little bigger.
3.0,"Giving 3 stars. Just receive garment really nice, but was too short for me. I am 5'9 I wear a size 10 order a 10/12 and I have broad shoulder. Probably should have ordered 14/16 but I feel it would be too big in the hip area. Going a size probably would have an effect on the length. I believe my torso is just too long for the outfit. But nice material."
3.0,Maybe I could lose a pound or two. but I like the merchandise
3.0,"I do think that I listened to a customer that stated this runs small.. Ordered an XL [I wear 14,,bust 40] and it is too large. A nice summer dress that is comfortable due to it's flared body..All in all I like it and will take it in on the top."
3.0,"Just okay, pretty cheap looking"
3.0,"This is a knit material, like a sweater.  Way too hot for the beach/pool where I live, so didn’t even try it on, but I love the look."
3.0,They look great but they're very tight...I got a large and normally I'd be a medium but the large even seem very small...I do love the material though so hopefully they stretch after washing them!
3.0,"The belt on this is a lot Smaller then advertised. My waist size is under 40 and this belt just barely fits, if I don't mind it being very tight"
3.0,Washed this dress on a cold wash and hung to dry. Product still shrunk.
3.0,"I was planning on giving this to someone as a gag gift so I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't the the sock didn't use the exact same picture of Namjoon as it showed in the picture. He still looks good. Just not as much of a meme :/ haven't actually opened it yet, so i can't speak about the quality of the socks themselves"
3.0,"I ordered my usual size and it was too small on me, plus it was very short (I'm 5'7"").  I was hopeful because I love the pink/orange print which is perfect for summer.  Quality was ok for the price."
3.0,"I liked the look of the vest, looks warm. I was not able to put on, super small. I  wouldn't even know what size to get if ordering."
3.0,"These are super stretchy and the feel on the skin is super smooth. The only drawback for me is that they roll up (especially when you walk a lot or engage in physical activity). Yes. And when they roll up, they begin to pinch in places that you rather not get pinched or punched in. You'll find yourself having to resist the urge to reach down there to readjust and repack. So, yes, the feel of these are awesome. The price is fair. But at the end of the day, the nether-grabbing is a deal breaker for me."
3.0,Wish they had arch support to help them from not sliding off as easily.
3.0,A little flimsier than I expected for the price.
3.0,Fabric was too limp and showed the waist too much.
3.0,This thing is pretty ugly.
3.0,the earrings are pretty but the clarity and sparkle is not as it is shown on the picture
3.0,"If you don’t have small hands to slide it on, be aware.  Love it otherwise."
3.0,"These aren’t dinosaurs, they are xenomorphs from the Alien movies. These would be so much better if the back clasp held on the post better. The backs slide right off and the earrings aren’t secure."
3.0,Shorts were too tight for my liking.
3.0,This dress is really tight so you have to be really skinny or else everything will show. I thought was sort of a stretch material but it's not
3.0,"4 of the rings were nice, but two had a bad mold when they were made.  They do not have the design like the others.  My light pink and silver have runs in the rings and I do not wear those two.  I like the other 4; not sure I would buy again."
3.0,"Beautiful material. Bra fits a bit snug but wearable. Underwear, however are very small."
3.0,"I have bought several gowns from different brands for my 3 mo baby who is 26.5&#34; (he is bigger than the average) and everything was too short for him. And this finally covers his feet. His feet stick out as he moves a lot during a sleep but I think this brand makes the longest gowns. I bought 0-6 mo sizes and they have mittens but sleeves are too short to cover his hands. Material is not as soft as other brands I found on Amazon. It is on the thicker side. Might be good in the winter and cooler areas but I don't recommend them if you live in hot climate.<br /><br />Although I like the design of it, my biggest regret of buying this is the design.The clouds on the material are painted and it makes noise when I rub my LO's back for burping. He is half asleep after feeding in the middle of the night and this noise sometimes surprises and wakes him up. I also bought ones with no patterns and I have ended up using them more."
3.0,"This watch looks nice for the office, but after a couple months the battery died and the band was starting to tear. The advertised watch warranty did not work for replacement. Amazon offered me a partial refund, but the refund amount wasn't worth the trouble to actually return the item. As is true with most things, you get what you pay for."
3.0,It would’ve been  great if it was 100% cotton
3.0,"At first I was very happy with this dress. Size and vibrant colors whas just as I wanted. But... After first laundry all blue part shrinks. Embroidered border isn't shrinks. So, you can't  wear it anymore. Make your choice."
3.0,Came on time as stated.  They'll do the job I want them to do.
3.0,"I love the look of this sweater and its very soft. Also not too light or heavy. My hubby is a sweaty man lol and he wears with a buttton up underneath and it looks rlly nice.<br /><br />It does run a tad small though. Short in the torso for sure. Also thought it was a little more than odd it came with absolutely NO tags on it whatsoever.... Kind of wondering where this came from or if it was a return or what, also bothered me I couldnt make sure it was the right size. Also had a few loose strands coming from it. Will update with picture."
3.0,Cute dress but thinner material and more sheer than anticipated.
3.0,Pendant a bit bulky. Giving as gift to grandaughter.  It will work. A bit clunky looking. But cheep. Not bad for play jewlery.
3.0,Came defective can’t really give a review
3.0,Nice but the ends of the sunglasses hit the lens and scratch them in no time.
3.0,Hangs a little odd but ok for the beach
3.0,they are a little to short
3.0,It is a tad bit small...other has to be for a small size 12/14 not a curvy 14
3.0,"****Disclaimer****<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST review.  The first turn off was that it arrived smelling like stale cigarette smoke, and considering I'm not a smoker that was a big no no.  Also be advised it's not actual denim it's like a cotton blend that looks like denim. The fabric is very soft and comfortable though."
3.0,"Seem to be decent quality, the colors are nice, but they are shaped weirdly and I am not sure what to even use them in."
3.0,Pretty good fit and quality and about what you might expect given the low price.  Perfect for use as &#34;disposable&#34; fishing glasses.
3.0,Its cute but really big. Cute with leggings but not with jeans.
3.0,I would love loved this if it was more of a knit material.. it’s pretty thin!
3.0,Gorgeous but tiny
3.0,"We got this full-zip fleece jacket for our daughter and it's neither bad nor great.  The first thing that was a little bit disappointing was that it doesn't look as plush in person as in the pictures.  The nap looks smaller and shorter in person.  The material is thankfully very soft, both on the outside and on the inside which features a liner that's really comfy and smooth.  The jacket provides pretty good warmth thanks to the outer layer and the liner.  It's not like a heavy coat, but it's nice for cool temps where you don't want something needlessly bulky.  The fit is accurate.  The one other complaint, however, is that the zipper doesn't move smoothly (at least in the up direction - down is fine).  It tends to catch several times when she zips it up.  Overall this isn't a bad fleece layer and our daughter likes it fine, but it's not quite as good as I expected."
3.0,they seem to be the right size but they are so short that they end of working down into my little girls shoes.  She doesn't like to wear them.
3.0,For me personally the brim was too wide. But it’s a very cute hat otherwise.
3.0,"The shoes smelled like old lettuce when they arrived. Took days to air them out. Then, it took only two wears around the house on carpet for the insoles to come out."
3.0,They are alright the straps the go along the rear where made a little too long. The back straps don’t hug or support like I expect. And the fabric it’s made of would have last if the did
3.0,not my favorite dress and see through but its good as a cover up
3.0,"I did not like that picture advertising the item showed a 12 pack of socks, and the price was the same as a 12 pack of socks. However, after receiving a half of a 12 pack of socks I read the item description. It said that 6 pair of socks were included. If I wasn't in a great need for the socks at the time that I had received them, then I would immediately returned the item and requested a refund. There is another seller that offers a full 12 pack of these socks for a dollar less. Same exact socks."
3.0,Beautiful but I ordered wrong size it was too tight
3.0,I thought I could use this on my Passport wallet as it is too narrow. I returned it.
3.0,Looks great and good quality.  Super bummed the band dye bleeds onto your skin when it gets wet!
3.0,My daughter loves it but the size runs smaller than it says.
3.0,"I always get my slips at Dillards and they say 36inches but these were way to long, I plan on buying more at a different length, the material was ok and the were comfortable"
3.0,"I like the design and feel of the bracelet, however, its way smaller than I had imagined. I have small hands and I can just barely get it around my hand. Also, it appears to be the type the bracelet that is suppose to stay open once your pull it apart, but it does not. That being said, it does get the job done, and I don't mind it."
3.0,It fit nice but has less design on the actually product
3.0,These are not no-show socks for boat shoes..... they are no-show socks for tennis shoes.  Purchase carefully!
3.0,"It's pretty, I'll give it that. The material is very thin. It's almost too soft and thin to correctly tie it on your head. Also I'm sure many buying this are looking for something to wear overnight. I'm mixed African American / Caucasian and was looking for something to tame these curls at night... Needless to say it's in my sheets somewhere as I write this."
3.0,I was expecting the pants also.
3.0,Runs very small. Check the sizing chart first.
3.0,"This suit is cuter than I expected from the front.  The ruffled shoulder straps  can camouflage big upper arms.  The keyhole opening in the front is small and tasteful.  The only breast support is floating, removable pads.  I never prefer this to an actual shelf bra, but in this suit, because of it having a high waist seam and adjustable ruching between the breasts, there is not much room for the pads to ""roam"" and they pretty much stay in place.  The suit is fully lined with a soft, stretchy white knit fabric.  What makes this unwearable for me is the design of the back.  I am a little overweight and the back design accentuates my back fat in a nice package with a bow on top!  Oops, definitely not designed for me.  Not much support and highlights back fat.  It these are not issues for you, it's a cute, inexpensive suit."
3.0,"I’m 5’2” tall, 130 lbs with a 34C bust size and a short upper body. I didn’t notice any rolling like some other reviewers did but there was a lot of fat pinching. I have some postpartum weight but not enough to pinch like these did. My other sports bras don’t pinch like these do. I believe the pinching is due to the material used for lining. Some fat pinching is expected sometimes if they are providing good support but I simply bounced by bending the knees repeatedly without jumping and I thought I was going to get two black eyes with the lack of support! If you’re a runner or like to jump rope and are larger than a B cup this is NOT for you! As other reviewers have noted the padding is awkward. Removing them is a must but super easy with the large slots on the sides. As far as the look of them goes, I like them without shirts maybe for a home workout. However, under tanks the black lines with the colors look awkward, especially if you don’t want the sports bars to be an eye-catcher. My gym clothes are nice looking and they sports bras throws them off. If you are hiding under larger clothes or wearing them without tops they might work well for you. The colors themselves are really nice! The material is super comfortable but I didn’t workout in them to know if sweating would provide any irritation.  They’re probably a good buy for what you’re spending but I prefer quality over quantity. I struggled between two and three stars because I can see how this might benefit others even though they weren’t for me."
3.0,Need to size down twice.. I normally wear a US10 and I could wear this in a size medium but decided to keep the large.. I already had one return from xl to large..
3.0,Bigger than anticipated
3.0,Coating chipping off after 2 weeks
3.0,For my ears
3.0,Love the earrings. The clasp is poorly fitted and earrings fall off too easily. Had to take needle nose pliers to adjust.
3.0,"This mesh bracelet is worth $20 at most. It looks better in the photo but pretty rough and generic looking in person; not mention the fold over clasp has some scratches on it. I don't think these are any different than the other versions that are sold on amazon and I thought these were better made since the price is 4 times the cost. Well, at least it appears to be working and fit pretty securely. If anyone decides to get this mesh bracelet, don't expect a nice, refined looking bracelet. It will look cheap. If you want something that just works and don't care for the look, there are other options out there."
3.0,Paints was more fitted not as flared like the picture and the color is totally off ... Still not a bad outfit ... I'll still wear it
3.0,I THEY WERE CUTE BUT I THINK I LOST THEM WHEN I MOVED
3.0,"This is a great product, I have ordered twice. However this second shipment didn’t have the full 18 as it should."
3.0,Thy are too big and I filled the size chart now am just stuck with them
3.0,"This one was smaller then expected, I ordered the exact same thing  just a different color, and they are both totally different material and fit."
3.0,"These will be great leggings to lounge in, but only with a long shirt because they are completely transparent in the back, even without bending. They're soft and stretchy and will probably stay up okay, but of course - I won't be using them for anything but eating snacks on the couch while watching something on HBO or Hulu or otherwise, my butt will be on FULL display! :)"
3.0,Thus ring was pretty and Good sized. However the color is very vivid blue and therefore the stones look fake. They also looked more like simulated opals than sapphires.
3.0,The dress was really good but it just didn't fit as I expected. Maybe order one size smaller than your normal size.
3.0,"Beautiful until I leaned down to pick something up and the chain broke. I fought with it all night long during the military ball, and it just wasn’t strong enough. I would make the chain much stronger with harder metals so well-endowed women can enjoy wearing these and not be self-conscious if it breaks. I’m going to take the chain off it and attach it to fabric straps so it doesn’t happen again. It’s a shame, because they’re so pretty. I was really hoping they would’ve worked."
3.0,"Nice stainless steel chain of the correct length but it doesn't look like the picture, the links on the one I got have a much bigger gap between the links.<br /><br />After reviewing the original listing the very last picture on the column at left shows what I got.... yet all the other pictures show a different chain link type?"
3.0,"Cute top that’s lightweight and great for summer weather.  More like junior sizing, ran a little small for me so had to return."
3.0,I wish it fit better. Was very nice quality material though.
3.0,"The glasses have a great design and look nice, but the lenses are not very dark at all.  Best suited for an overcast day.<br /><br />The frames also were somewhat small, and didn't quite fit on my averaged-sized male head.  Perhaps would be better suited for a female face."
3.0,"Like few other reviewer mention it doesn't look like the photos. The cloud pattern to me looks more like styrofoam scatter within the sphere. The sphere itself feel plastic instead of glass or marble, so it feels very light.<br />This necklace will be good for a little girl as a present but not for an adult or teenager."
3.0,"I usually wear a MEDIUM, but this item was extremely large on me. I reordered a small.<br />hopefully this will fit."
3.0,Too big for my fingers I  had to roll the ends up
3.0,I ordered an XL 16-18. This is more like a size 8. Was so looking forward to having this for this summer. Order at least 2 or more sizes up. The bathing suit seems to be well made and is a nice quality. Very disappointed that it runs so small.
3.0,"It was pretty much what I expected except, the photo shows the pants folded up at the bottom and a few inches above the ankle.  In reality they are quite long-- and I have long legs.  But you can't easily fold them up because they are flared.  So I'm going to have to hem them and sew the pant leg narrower at the bottom. But they were cheap and they are light weight. I just bought them for them to knock around in the hot weather.  I'll see how long they last."
3.0,Super long compared to what I got mine pierced with.
3.0,"Zipper damages easily. Otherwise, it’s a good jacket."
3.0,Not large enough in the toe
3.0,Too big for my face but then again my face is kinda small
3.0,"I want to love this tie bar, but I got it for my dad and the wood part fell off within ten minutes of him wearing it. I guess it would be an easy fix with hot glue or something, but it still makes me so sad because otherwise, this makes a great gift."
3.0,Did not work for me!  I had to keep the book in about 10cm to see the words clear! That is too close to be comfortable.
3.0,Good value. If your child is a size five this might be snug and a little short.
3.0,"I really loved how this dress fit me, but didn't love the print. It was a lot busier in person than what was featured in the listing. I am 5'9, 220lbs, usually an XL/XXL, and found the XXL to be a little loose."
3.0,The dress is much smaller than expected.
3.0,Good looking decent quality for single or couple time use. But a little flimsy and very small. 11” length would supposedly be men’s size 10-11. But these were too small for my size 9. Fine for women or smaller feet for a few uses. A bit expensive for the quality.
3.0,Item was much bigger than expected.
3.0,It was way too big for my neck but very cute. I sowed on new buttons an cut off the excess so it fits well now but wouldn't recommend unless you have a very thick neck or proper sewing supplies. Otherwise arrived very fast and is great quality. Its also quite large in general as in a thick band and big heart but I still like it.
3.0,The quality of these cuff links is very good. My only complaint is that it's difficult to see the design and gold color as well.
3.0,Not as long nor very warm. I’ve had acrylic stockings that were much more so.
3.0,It's cute. However it is a bit thin and not of the softest material.
3.0,This is actually an updated review. It took multiple communications with the seller to resolve my issues but it was finally resolved.
3.0,Two sizes to small.
3.0,"I was going to use these for Halloween I wanted the pumpkin headband since I made my Pumpkin outfit, but the sewing on the feather part did not meet with the orange material, I have yo find someone to hand sew it, it's in the front too.  Not too happy and theirs no more.  Now I checked out the witch headband I need to recluse her down.."
3.0,"Cute shirt in the photograph, but runs very small and bunches at the waste. Definitely order a size up."
3.0,"Ordered my regular size, was much smaller than expected. Definitely size up!"
3.0,Not as flattering as I thought it would be.
3.0,Cute but didn't fit.
3.0,They arrived prior to expected date however some of the stop balls on the bone are crooked and make it difficult to insert them in the nose hole.
3.0,"This is a really pretty dress, it hugged my curves perfectly. I got a bigger bottom half and at 5’7 and 160 lb am not the most petite but the dress was really flattering in fit. I just didn’t love the reddish-brown color on me as a blonde, the ruffles, or the whole prairie gal feel"
3.0,Not true to size … fits small
3.0,Zipper problem
3.0,Super cute socks. They fit nicely the only reason I gave less stars is the dots are annoying - the spots leave marks on skin and can irritate toes that rub in shoe. Cute for around the house though but maybe my feet are just picky.
3.0,Its a cute dress. I gifted it to my friend's newborn and she said its too big on him. Its a convenient one piece dress on small babies and She loved the style. Now waiting for him to grow upto it.
3.0,Really like it but 2 links broke first time I wore it
3.0,"Sweatshirt very light weight, and runs very small. I wear a xsmall and ordered a large for a gift for a friend that will fit me. Size up! Otherwise very cute shirt. Shipping a little slow but probably due to covid and holidays!"
3.0,"Very see through , you can’t even wear underwear . I returned them and the length is way to long . Not normal sizes ."
3.0,Love the pattern and the material but the arms are insanely tight. Creates a flailing meltdown every night when we can’t get her hands through the holes in a timely fashion. Our daughter is on the thin side so I don’t know which baby they had in mind when making these pjs.
3.0,This is the third pair of these shoes that have been too small. I went up in size knowing now that they run small but the strap across the top is so tight it’s restricting my blood to my feet.
3.0,One of the studs fell out almost immediately.
3.0,"These are SO beautiful- and a bargain at twice the price, BUT... the way the leaf is attached to the earring hook doesn't really make sense.  What I mean is... when you wear them, the leaf is best seen from the side NOT the front."
3.0,Good quality but size is off.
3.0,"LOVE this bag!!!!!  It has nice pockets on the inside for cell phone and other things you want to get to quickly.  I love that it is not sooooo deep it becomes a black hole.  I hate deep, dark purses you have to dig through to find anything.  Not with this one!  The sipper opens up wide enough to really see into the bag.  It really looks nice and I have had many compliments!  Love it!!!  I received this bag at a reduced price for my honest opinion.<br /><br />Addition to my previous review:  If I could take some stars away, I would:(  Sadly this purse started to fall apart about 3 months later.  Some of the leather embellishments came of the purse.  The zipper broke and stitching came unraveled.  It became completely unusable.  It was not even worth the reduced price I paid.  Not well made at all."
3.0,"these are sheers, Its not very clear in the description. NOT socks, sock like booties made of a sheer fabric... very beautiful and fit well but these are like pantyhose material... not socks."
3.0,These tags look pretty good and it’s a decent price but I wish they were waterproof somehow.  I feel like if they get rained on the tag itself won’t be legible
3.0,"If you’re a 16, order a 14. All I’m sayin."
3.0,"Nice coat but it was a little tight on me. I usually wear XL, but the XXL was a bit too small."
3.0,"Unable to receive notification such as sms, phone calls, whatsapp, facebook, instagram etc. I downloaded the app ""DA FIT"" so I'm not sure what the issue could be. Everything else seems to be working fine. Please HELP!!!"
3.0,"I love Alligator items real and fake-I guess it's because I was born in Florida..I have shoes, belts, buckles,  brief  cases,I had a phone case and now cuff links..The color match is off,it look like the company that make these,have two types,gold and silver..And they painted the silver ones,two shades of green..Because I love Alligator  stuff the lack of color match,is No big deal.They wont be seen together in the same frame,and you have to look real hard to see,the off color..I will by again,I think I will buy some Gold ones next."
3.0,"The warn red is NOWHERE near a warm red. The color that you receive is absolutely, without question a hot pink!! Just an FYI. Seemed cheap but if it would have been the right color I would have kept it."
3.0,"I love the purse, but the inside zipper pocket already lost it's stitching and has a huge hole in the pocket. I've only had it two weeks"
3.0,Bracelet is beautiful!  The clasp is terrible!  The main connection doesn’t lock and the side clasps are very loose and come open by themselves.  Bracelet came undone the first day she wore it and fell off.
3.0,"I ordered several PattyBoutik items at once, so it was easy to compare the items. Typically, if I order a large, it fits. This sweater is a L and it *does* fit, but the arms are a bit tight (I have skinny arms) and the stitching looks stretched. I prefer my sweaters to look like they fit, not like my B cup tits are about to break the damn sweater. If you typically wear a large, get an extra large, just in case."
3.0,"The sunglasses are decent quality and a good buy for the price.  I can't give it better than a 3, though, because they are much bigger than they appeared in the picture and look absolutely hideous on me.  I know that probably sounds stupid, but I think buying sunglasses you can't try on first is a huge mistake and I won't be doing it again."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium and that’s what I ordered. I love the way they fit and looked except the elastic in the waistband was way too tight be comfortable. Had to return item, bummer!"
3.0,"Was looking for a bracelet with a blue tassel, so I got this. It's cute and simple, which I like. Adjustable sizing makes it fit easily. However, the strings on the end are already fraying apart and the tassel fell off once and I had to tie it back on after wearing for a day."
3.0,"Nice fitting, but SUPER thin material. I don’t think it works to prevent anything virus related"
3.0,"Fabric is thin and stretchy, but will full coverage. I'm pretty happy with the fit. Ordered a XXL. Little bit tight around my bust, but I'm rather large up top. Other wise very cute and has pockets."
3.0,Too loose and fabric is kind of hot
3.0,Sleeves are r as big and bulky. Found the same sweater at Homegoods for much less.
3.0,"I was looking for large masks for my husband with a large face/beard, but without being able to tighten the ear straps or pinch the nose bridge to fit, it just sort of sagged on his face and was gapping in places."
3.0,"I followed the size chart and this shirt was just too small. I have plenty of rolls and flub, just had baby number 4 a few months ago, but I took that into account when ordering. It was cute, the graphic was printed well, the material was acceptable for the price. Just to darn small!"
3.0,Bigger than I expected and color was a bit different than shown in the picture. I ended up returning. :(
3.0,The watch color was a little darker than I expected and it feels almost like a hard plastic.  I think I just expected more.
3.0,I’m pretty sure I received a damaged and returned item. It came marked up with little red arrow stickers pointing to damaged areas and the button was off.
3.0,It said kid size and was way too big for my 6 year old
3.0,This sheds everywhere. I just have to be more cautious as to what I wear with it.
3.0,"So I thought these were pink because the title of this item starts with the word PINK! But that is the brand name I guess? These are actually red. They aren't great quality, but I need them for a costume party, so they will do. And they run a tad small."
3.0,A lot baggier than I expected
3.0,Broke after couple of weeks
3.0,So so.. For the price.. Its nice.
3.0,gets soiled easily..love the design maybe next time i will choose a different color. Great storage. convenient pockets
3.0,"I am 5ft 2"" 130lbs I purchased the Small which was a perfect fit. It is a good quality but i think it is a tad bit short, the product would get 5 stars if it was a bit longer."
3.0,I bought this you work with the Exoforged cup. The  cup pocket can't actually Velcro closed with the cup in place. The fit of the jock isn't terrible but the cup sticks out of the top of the pocket and I'm worried it could work its way out while sparring. It'll be relegated to a back up to keep in my gear bag.
3.0,"Much shorter than displayed. I am a 5, have long legs and torso and am 5'8 so you can use that as a reference. I just wore with leggings."
3.0,It's a really nice shirt it can be use for working out or as casual the quality it's not so great I order 3 or them and one was ripped 😩 the price wouldn't be so bad it the quality was better.
3.0,"It is so cheap that I won't ask too much.  The flame is just some toy plastic, and it is kind of too big for me."
3.0,"I got my pants. They are heavy weight and I live in S FL. They are also SMALL! And they smell. But, I like them so I ordered a size up and am hoping for the best. I also hope I get a full refund when I return or I shall be pissed!!!!"
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  This looked like something I could get at Ross, so I returned it because I was looking for something more special.  Heavy material, appliqued sequins."
3.0,They were pretty especially the tye dye.  They fit very good but had to give some away because I wasn't satisfied with some color  so u have half away.  Also didn't come with the xlith inserts for more protection.
3.0,Actual print looks faded.  Not as vivid as pictured! A soft fabric it is and I love knotted front!  But would have liked print a bit darker!!
3.0,A moderate amount of shrinkage but cute and comfy!
3.0,It is very flimsy at the seams on the top of the wings. It looks like it is going to tear at any moment
3.0,"We did the online test first and it said we had a 75% chance of having a positive experience.  My son (age 8) says some colors look brighter, but it wasn't a dramatic change like some people I have seen on the videos.  He has a pretty significant color problem with red/green. So these glasses didn't help as much as I had hoped, but he still likes to wear them to see the slight color variation.  They seem to work better outside in bright light.  Also wish they came in a child size - we purchased the adult size since we were so desperate to try them out, but they are a little loose."
3.0,"While I like the overall feel of these shorts, the pockets stick out of the bottom. Seeing the white material stick out underneath the olive green material is very noticeable!"
3.0,I ordered my regular size and it fits fine. The wrinkles fall out but I am wondering about the life-time of the fabric.  It is quite thin but am keeping it because it was inexpensive and I will use it for an upcoming trip.
3.0,I thought the case was completely hard shelled.  It's okay.  The mistake was mine.
3.0,"Size was super big and i thought i have a big but when i saw and try it, it double my head size."
3.0,"I don’t have an especially large head. But this thing was so tight I couldn’t open my eyes fully. However, it fits my two young kids very nicely and seems decent quality"
3.0,"Very nice dress, but unfortunately it was way to tight!!  I am 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs and usually a size 4.  I bought a medium  but was way too tight."
3.0,"I don’t like the materials, it’s too thin for skirt and not as I expected. The size is true size. I don’t recommend and won’t buy it again."
3.0,"I was hoping this dress would be as described, i.e. mostly cotton with some spandex. It isn't. It's a cheap, fairly thin polyester-like knit that wrinkles if you look at it. I'm sure in 3-4 washes it will pill and/or run & snag like every other garment ever made in the world in this fabric. It's a pretty red and at least the armholes are high enough so you don't have to wear something underneath it, although unless you like displaying your bra to the world, you'll want to anyway. I'd order a smaller size unless you want it really loose."
3.0,Very pretty butterflies but the backing came loose (a little flimsy) and I lost one earring the first time I wore it.
3.0,Expected a more loose hanging fabric but it’s a more thick and boxy fabric/look. The shorts don’t have a back or front so unless you have no booty they look a little odd. I’ve washed and dried them several times and they haven’t shrunk. Overall they are  comfortable but not worth the money seeing as how you can get something of equal quality at a Walmart for way less
3.0,I ordered this watch but had to return it because it was too large for my wrist. Other than that it looks just like the picture .
3.0,I order this pin and had to request another one. They both came with short stems. I was unable to fasten it to secure it on my top.
3.0,"Blah, very muted colors, didn’t excite me, priced a little higher, wasn’t worth keeping. Returned it. True to size. It was just so bland."
3.0,Soft and easily to walk in for a while but not long term because the thong part that fits between your big toe is so thick it eventually becomes very uncomfortable
3.0,"If you are looking for a good holder for your masks, get one with lobster claws. Unfortunately, these clips are too hard to open.  I broke a nail every time I tried."
3.0,Watch is okay but the Leather straps are so thick they don’t bend easily to fasten
3.0,"Okay so these are really pretty! But - some of the mini opalescent pieces are put into their settings crooked and one of the earrings also doesn’t close securely. The two end pieces aren’t close enough together to hold the pin in place when you snap it shut, although that can be fixed with a pair of pliers of course. The quality just really isn’t what I was expecting although they’re still pretty since they look like mini pink opals. Just kinda disappointing!"
3.0,"So this is weird, because it is too long, maybe because I am 5' 3&#34;, and I also have big arms, so this is tight in the upper sleeve area. Overall, the shirt is really cute. Love the color. I am losing weight, so the arms issue will go away and I can get the back hemmed."
3.0,Quality ok....
3.0,See through and made cheaply.
3.0,"Don’t seem like authentic Guess Glasses a lot bigger on face and quality not that great<br /><br />The 1 pic is the ones that I purchase<br />The 2nd pair is the ones I was trying to match that I originally bought from the Guess store<br /><br />Definitely differences in Quality, look. Weight and style"
3.0,Fabric stains easily.
3.0,"Was too small, however company was good about resolving issue to my satisfaction. Defiantly order a size up."
3.0,Super cute but very flimsy. Arm piece snapped right off when I opened it to try them on :(
3.0,Nice piece but had 8 stones were missing so I had to send it back :/
3.0,Sent in a box it doesn’t fit in. Was hanging out. Thought it would be a little better made and won’t stay up on ear.
3.0,"I like the jeans, but they are a skinny fit, not a boyfriend fit.  I will still keep them though because they are cute.  I ordered a 16...fits well in the hips and waist."
3.0,"The quality isn't great, colors and style are way different than the picture. Works for a party, but not for everyday. Included a picture for comparison"
3.0,"I bought these for bonus client gifts and didn't get around to opening them until it was too late to return them. They are very small and very cheap feeling and looking. They are fine for my 8yo and her friends but not for adult clients. Also, they are adjustable in the fact that you can adjust them to what size you need but that's it...they are not adjustable to take on and off easily."
3.0,Well mixed reviews... it's a nice purse the main one. But it's not big enough for me. The other 2 bags they were sent with it tho are a way darker pink so they don't match....
3.0,"a little tight and took a bit for the leather to stretch to fit my hands, but did great for my cosplay"
3.0,Loved the color and fabric was so soft but ended up returning because the legs were huge and waist was tiny. I am more apple shaped but if you were a pear shape perfect for you.
3.0,"The chain is nice, sturdy and long just as it says it will be, so that was nice. However, the acrylic rose is not close to the color in the picture. It's a nice creamy color in the picture, but when it arrived it's almost yellow and it looks dirty on some of it. I suppose people won't be totally analyzing the jewelry up close, and it's certainly nice for what I paid for it. It also arrived earlier than expected, so that's always nice. I wouldn't recommend buying it though, at least not this necklace in particular."
3.0,THIS WAS A GIFT
3.0,It's T-shirt material alright. I got a large hoping it would be lose on the waist but not exactly what I had in mind.
3.0,Super cute & dainty. But the earrings don't always stay in place and I'm not sure how to attach them firmly enough to stay affixed to my ear.
3.0,"Pros:  Decent gloves for the price. Hopefully they will hold up with normal use and over time.<br />Cons:  I normally wear a LG. to XLG. glove. After reading other reviews on this glove I decided to order a XXLG size so I could add a liner if necessary. Overall the XXLG gloves I received run small and are a challenge to put on easily. The little finger of the right hand glove remains a very tight fit.<br />  There's no way these gloves are going to keep your hands warm in -30ºF weather.  While the interior lining is soft  and fluffy, my hands became quite cold and some fingertips numb after only being outside about 30 minutes in 20ºF weather."
3.0,A little small. Great as added coverage to low cut shirts.
3.0,"It’s cute and I like it, however I ordered a brown one and received a grey one."
3.0,"So this tank essentially does what it's marketed to do, which is trap heat and help promote sweating. If you're using in a mostly stationary way, such as sitting in a sauna, I would say it's fine. The problem is that it's quite scratchy/rough just under the arms, so if you are using it in a pretty active workout, it's irritating and abrasive to the point where I had to take it off.  I tried washing it a couple times to see if it would help, but it didn't make much of a difference.<br /><br />I would say this works, but caution you to consider what you're doing to ""work up"" that sweat."
3.0,Was too hard to set up
3.0,"I received this watch in good shape. However, one week later, the battery was dead. THE # STARS ARE BASDED PRIMARILY ON THE FACT THAT THE BATTERY DIED LESS THAN ONE WEEK AFTER i received it.[[ASIN:B008JEZG7Q Blue Binary Men's Fashion Watch by TVG]]"
3.0,A nice dress but runs small. I think a whole size.
3.0,full figured women ..order one size up ..fabric is a bit clingy ...but it's a nice dress
3.0,take one - two size up.
3.0,These hardly fit &#34;relaxed!&#34; Order at least a size or two up. Very tight fiting.
3.0,Top was HUGE but the bottoms fit
3.0,"Cute, but it’s not like the sweater shown in the photo. Very different material. If you’re looking for a sweatshirt this isn’t it."
3.0,Material is great. Colors are great. My only complaint is they run a little small.
3.0,It fits nicely and the fabric is wonderful. It did however arrive with a hole in the scoop neck Sean where the dress separated from the binding of the scoop neck. I had already thrown away my packaging when I noticed it.
3.0,I am 5'6'  145lbs  exact measurements for the Large as advertized. These were way to big .They went up to under my bra line in the waist and sagged everywhere.They are thin soft comfy.I needed them for my halloween leggings so I made due and will have to keep them as pajamas as I wore them and it served the purpose but with disappointment.Great pajama bottoms I would not buy again for leggings even if I got a perfect fit as they seem to be more of a pajama bottom feel and look .
3.0,Cute for night out but it breaks easily
3.0,I loved how small it is. Worked great at having a rolled piece of paper with medical information. Is water proof too. But It seems to come unscrewed. I have now lost 3 bottoms along with my medical information. I have 1 more so going to try special tape to keep it from unscrewing. beware.
3.0,"I liked it until the sticky part started separating from the bra itself and rolled up to where the bra would not stick to my skin after only wearing it twice.  It was comfortable and held well for the most part; however, the adherence to the skin could have been better.  They should really look into the type of adhesive that is used with electrodes, as that would work great with this product, and/or a way to replace the adhesive.  I SO wish this had a better adhesion to the bra, as it would have been awesome to continue with!!  I am returning for a refund due to this."
3.0,very nice but indicates am they were for girls and truth have a very large size.
3.0,Good cover up
3.0,Cute garment but it was at least 2 sizes too small for my child. Ill be gifting it to a smaller child in her dance class. Go up at least 1 size if you order.
3.0,These shoes are very difficult to put on. I bought them for a one year old with chubby feet so maybe that was the issue but we couldn't even get them on him once. I imagine when they're wet it's even more difficult. Maybe for an older child they could work better. They are very flexible and thin. I ultimately ended up returning them.
3.0,"While it fit well, the design began to wear off on the first wear."
3.0,"I bought this because another review said it would be great for maternity wear and I always like to buy stuff that I can use after baby is born as well. I love the color of it and it is very soft and I can tell it will be comfortable in the hot summer months. That being said, it is a little short on me and I did size up do to other reviews recommending it... I will either wear it with leggings or as a beach cover up so I am still going to keep it, but if you are 5'6 or taller, be prepared that this may not sit as a dress for you."
3.0,Very pretty however not the best quality. Very thin material.
3.0,The necklace is ok but I thought it would be larger.
3.0,Fabric pills and collects lint easily but otherwise good fit. My 11yo son loves them and doesn't seem to mind the pilling/lint!
3.0,"This is very see through.. i get around it by wearing white underwear and it's not that noticeable. Also, the elastic at the top is very very tight. I have only about a 26'' waist and after a whole day of wearing this skirt I have marks on my belly from the waist band."
3.0,They were fine but a little big for kids
3.0,The shirt is cute with thick cotton. The pants however are very stiff so much so that I won't be able to sleep in them. They would make great scrubs though! The picture shows how stiff they are. They hold their own form when I bent them.
3.0,"The chin strap is too short to go above the brim to store.  It is nylon, so it is way hotter than my polyester hat.  No tags in it to tell you any info on it.  Price was good.  Very floppy brim that is hard to shape.  Overall it is okay."
3.0,The lense is so light it doesn't cover any sun but they look cute
3.0,This is NOT burgundy! It us a traditional red.<br />Nicely made.<br />Def. Order at least one size up.
3.0,"Got as a gift for my boyfriend. He said the magnet for the bills is a little on the weaker side, and if you have more than 12 bills it can’t keep them clasped."
3.0,"Strange fit. Material feels like a swimsuit. I disagree with other consumers about the arm length being to long, its actually to short on me.  The sleeves on the arms are some what wide as well. Overall would not recommend this product."
3.0,The purple is there in mirror however I would place it at a mid range tint for the glasses themselves. Little smaller than I thought and the fact the frame was a painted gold was a little upsetting because I thought it looked silver. The game itself is extremely light and flimsy but makes it easier to bend. If I hadn't of had a credit and paid a little less than 10 I would be more upset.
3.0,"Love the material and the skirt is holding its shape well after several washes. However, the pocket is sewed  upside down rendering it completely useless."
3.0,"This towel is soft and fits over a kid still wearing a life jacket however the microfiber material collects so much grass, moss, dirt, whatever that I spent hours trying to pick it clean after use on a camping trip. It did not come clean in the wash. Maybe if it were only used at a pool it would be fine. I wouldn’t use it for an outdoor water activity where it might be thrown on the grass or ground."
3.0,"Love it, but the attachments are falling off. Check it frequently."
3.0,Very nice material but runs on the small side.
3.0,The wristband can get very uncomfortable after a while
3.0,"I love these joggers, however, I ordered the dark grey and received the light grey. The material is thin, so they're more suited for the bed rather than the gym. I too wish the fit and color was as advertised, however, I think I just found my new favorite jammie bottoms :)"
3.0,The blue is turquoise.
3.0,Ripped already. Bummer.
3.0,"Loved them but they were way to small, had to return but they were going to be perfect with outfit"
3.0,"It's a nice jacket. Feels nice, pretty much exactly what i wanted....<br /><br />Except I bought an XXL and it fits like a Large. Like... in what world is this an XXL? I couldn't be more disappointed in this.<br /><br />If you  buy this, buy 2 sizes bigger then what you are."
3.0,"After 1st day, stone fell out of one of the earrings. Unless you are a jeweler, there is no way to replace the stone. Guess to you get what you pay for??! Very disappointed."
3.0,I don't mind that be skirt being sheer. my issue is that I did not like that be slip underneath is not long enough
3.0,Cute but short. Weird fit. It’s almost too big but it’s too short for a cardigan fit. But I’ll keep it cuz I like the color. Wear with jeans not leggings
3.0,Love them but they are way too big!
3.0,"I ordered a medium and the dress fit great except for the chest area...somewhat too big. The length was perfect, just had no idea it was way more of a beach dress material not wedding attire."
3.0,Way too lage. The lettering on the began falling.
3.0,Much too short!
3.0,"If you're looking to have a quick grab frame from one end to the other of your home - these work in a pinch. However, their field of view is frustrating to me and you have to peep through the one *perfect* spot to see clearly. Stick to the $15 frames in your local store. You'll probably be happier in the long run."
3.0,Love the print but it fits very short in torso and arms
3.0,Hardly can see anything in the necklace
3.0,"This Sonja Betro women's plaid woven balloon tunic looks great for many occasions.  Plaid is back in style and this shirt fits right in.  It has balloon sleeves and is made of 100% cotton.  It's color is navy and green, with the combo going really well together.  You can machine wash it in cold water, but line dry or you will shrink it.  Iron as needed.  After a few washes it did fade though, and it also wrinkled very easy.  Don't leave this sitting in the laundry basket for too long.  Like the shirt but the up keep is too much."
3.0,"They fit well enough, slightly baggy as I expected. I'm 5'3&#34;, 110lbs, and the small is great. However the hardware is not great, the hooks come undone overtime I bend over. Usually good overall hardware locks so that doesn't happen. I'll probably switch out the hooks for some that I can buy at the sewing store."
3.0,"It's a very nice color and the gold matches the Apple series 4 gold nicely, its also very comfortable to wear. However, the leather on the bands are somewhat thin, and is already showing signs of wear after just 4 days of normal use."
3.0,Size is way smaller then I expected.
3.0,These boots smell  really bad. They smell like really cheap plastic shoes. They don't stay up
3.0,"I could not insert the check book as my other check holder wallet because it wouldn't snap shut.  Seems like the snaps are a little to low, they need to be all the way to the top.  So just can use as a wallet."
3.0,"Really didn’t work very well, slight difference"
3.0,A bit large..overall looks great.
3.0,"The scarf makes me claustrophobic, gave it to a 12 year old along with the thin ear muffs.  I like the hat and the gloves are good for cold weather but not snow."
3.0,I am giving this three stars because I order the U.S. Air Force vet cap. and I got a U.S. Navy Vet Cap instead. the cap is very good quality and it looks good. but I was not in the Navy.  I have not revived a replacement as of yet. great looking cap.
3.0,Runs big but great design!  Didn't send them back...he can wear them next summer.
3.0,They are super soft and great in the fit but the pockets are odd and not on my butt but closer to my thigh... also they go up almost to my boobs!
3.0,"This top arrived damaged - the elastic of the bra-top was ripped away. I got one in a different color and there was no damage. I have returned it.My rating does not reflect the damage, just the fit. And I wish the fabric was a bit more substantial"
3.0,"This item arrived super fast, colors are vibrant, and it even fits me well and ...I look cute in it!<br />Then why only 3 stars? Because it is made from plastic! Not cotton, not linen, nothing, 100% plastic fibers that feel awful to the touch.... I was hoping, but I have to return it..<br />If you are OK with wearing plastic during s or Hong hot summer days-then this is for you."
3.0,I Like the color.. however.. I purchased wrong size for me...and it's big..<br />The Allegra K's size is so difficult to understand . I purchase XS size with the other style  ... Hope It's right size for me ...
3.0,"okay but will see in use.  feels liked baby diaper only larger.  Not sure of environmental impact, definitely not for use as adult diaper"
3.0,Fit was much shorter than expected.
3.0,"It’s a cute dress. I should have ordered a size smaller but that is my mistake. However, the dressmaker cut the fabric upside down, so that the sheet music was oriented wrong. Also, the music notation was incorrect, as the number of beats per each measure on each clef did not match each other.  For example, on the treble clef, it might have 6 beats whereas the bass clef has 2"
3.0,"I bought the olive, black and burgundy dress. These are so comfy. No shrink, light weight, flowy fabric and it comes with POCKETS!"
3.0,Did not get what I expected and I’ve already used a few which all started threading out from the stitches on the upper arm area. I only use them as a sun shield
3.0,Quality is great but the XS was literally a large. The tag said XS. These are made way to big
3.0,"The tail itself is nice and fluffy. We got it for a Halloween costume, and it fell off after walking a block on only the first time having it worn. Very disappointed, and because I'm a planner and get things early I missed the return window for this. We didn't even really get to say we used it."
3.0,It look differenct in the package.
3.0,So these are cute. However I couldn’t wear them because I got two different sizes. Which sucks because like I said they’re pretty. The sparkles in them are very pretty. Just wish I had got the same size.
3.0,These fit very snug and I have very small legs...But they are cute!
3.0,"I used it a few times in Hawaii.  The first time it worked perfectly.  The second time my wallet was completely soaked.  I had gone to a second snorkel spot right after using it the first time and I probably hadn't gotten every grain of sand out of the large lock/closure at the top, so it leaked like a sieve.  It probably would have been fine if completely rinsed in fresh water between usages, but that wasn't possible in my case.  If you only use it once per day and clean it carefully each time, you probably won't have a problem.  If you expect to be hopping from one spot to the next, you should buy something else.<br /><br />It is roomy enough for most stuff and pretty easy to use.  The neck strap was very convenient to use on my camera, too."
3.0,It’s a nice sweater cardigan but when I got it I wasn’t extremely excited to wear it like I normally get with new clothes. It just didn’t give me that “spark joy” feeling
3.0,"I am giving this 3 stars, because it arrived heavily perfumed. Even after washing, I can still smell it."
3.0,These do not keep you from slipping. They don't fit as well as most of my socks.
3.0,"Although these are pretty and will work great on zippers, the pretty patterns are not nearly as sharp and clear as shown in the product description."
3.0,"I expected the dress to be longer, but with 3"" heels it falls to the top of my heel - I'm 5'5"".  I don't know why it asked for a size - it comes labeled OS.  There is a deep slit in the front, in the back, and on each side.  I'm not sure I really like this dress.  It flows, but for me, all the slits are a bit risque.  Not sure what to wear for a slip that won't be seen/exposed.  I guess some people may find it flirty."
3.0,"Credit card slots are inside of the bag rather than the wallet so if I want to switch purses I would have to remove them and find something else to put them in.  Also the strap keeps twisting up, not sure what I am doing to make it keep twisting. However, nice sturdy bag. My other Travelon came with an actual wallet which was very nice."
3.0,"Too soft, easy damage"
3.0,"This would have been a keeper with its nice case, vintage size and traditional dial, but it has absolutely horrible lume. If you don't need to see it at night, no biggie. If you do, opt for an Indiglo model, or a Seiko."
3.0,Too thin and itchy
3.0,These shirts are cute. They are nice and airy for working out in. My only issue is they seem to wrinkle so easily! I end up choosing another shirt instead of wearing these because I don’t have time to dewrinkle them. They also seem a bit thin but with being workout shirts it helps with not getting as sweaty.
3.0,It isn't quite my color or style but it is summer and this looks like winter to me.  Haven't worn it yet.
3.0,"The glasses are pretty good for the price. My only problem, well actually two problems. There were fingerprints all over the frames and the micro bag was missing. But for the money, I guess I cannot complain.<br /><br />UPDATE: after having these for a couple of days, I gave them to a friend who admired them. They were not for me."
3.0,Too small and they gave me a partial refund....
3.0,"The material was very light and airy, similar to a gauze-y cotton fabric. It would probably feel great in hot weather. The sleeves don't stay up on the shoulder particularly well, so it lost a star for that. I'm sure if that was the only problem, I'd still wear the shirt. The other reason this top lost a star was for the useless buttons. Buttons should hold a shirt together, but these buttons did not stay in their button holes. Any movement at all makes them pop out and the shirt flies open. For reference, I ordered a small, and I'm a proud member of the itty bitty committee. 😄  if the buttons did their job, I would probably wear this. I bought it for a rapunzel-inspired outfit for rennfaire, and the sleeves and style would've been perfect... its unfortunate that the buttons were a problem."
3.0,The shape of this bikini top is very tall and pointy. If you have short roots there's going to be empty space at the top and bottom. Made my boobs look very weird.
3.0,The XXL is a tight fit. The sleeves are tight with no stretching room. The fabric's a bit light but it'll work for a spring/early fall coat for him.
3.0,The purse was just the right size that I wanted but was very flimsy with no support.
3.0,"Mine is sewn completely wrong in the front. Not sure if anyone else would notice but it’s enough to make it feel cheap. If you’re on a strict budget, this is a cute dress. Id definitely recommend sizing down! I’m a size 2 and the small definitely fit more like a 4/6."
3.0,After my experience with other Amazon Sweatshirts I ordered a size larger.  Good thing I did.  Quality is better than others but still not up to par.
3.0,"This is cute from the front, good light knit fabric, good fit, good length, but the black chiffon trim ends at the left side seam at an awkward spot and it just looks odd to me. It definitely has the feeling of a different front put together with a back from another shirt. A little sad, but will definitely have to return."
3.0,"I bought this and the Made by Johnny Basic Stretchy Flare Skater for a summer Irish dance uniform. While skirt is okay, it it a little too long for me. I'm 5'7&#34; and it hits about 3-4&#34; above the knee from around my waist. This would be a good skirt for everyday use. I haven't had any quality issues. It fit fine but I'm not crazy about how it lays on my body. I'd prefer a little more flare. The fabric is very stretchy and a little thinner (but not see through), making this a great lightweight skirt."
3.0,"I like having some bifocal, non-prescription sunglasses so that I can see things without constantly switching from my sunglasses to my prescription bifocals. But, this is my second pair in about a year, because the frame broke on the first pair after about 8 months. I tried gluing them, but they eventually broke again. Maybe this pair will last longer. I guess you get what you pay for..."
3.0,"Wanted to like it but, It lays awkward. It's slighly tapperd at the bottom, not a good look in my opinion. Wish it was more flowy at the bottom."
3.0,"This is a okay scarf. In the picture it looks more blueish, but its a lot paler green than I was hoping for. Still I'm not totally disappointed."
3.0,"On the small side, especially in the bust area."
3.0,The chain had a kink in it and the chain is constantly twisting. It's annoying. So I don't wear it often.
3.0,Wish the inside lining wasn't tan since the leggings are dark grey. They are comfy but fits a little small.
3.0,Cute top but was going to try something different and turns out it's just not something I really wanted.  I like it but now is not the time for this style for me.  It's exactly as pictured.
3.0,This was such a cute dress. I didn’t like the flowy sleeves so my mother took them off and it made it look a lot better
3.0,"small and breathing is not an option, but hey its a mask!  and it was worth it just to hear my wife scream when opening the box!"
3.0,"Advertised as a man’s vest but zipper is on wrong side. Very misleading. Other than that, vest is made well."
3.0,Runs small. I had to return
3.0,Bought it to reduce my plantar fasciitis when I play sports. Didn't work.
3.0,"First, they are cotton which I like. I also purchased them because I liked the wide band around the top of the panty, Surprise! that band is only around the front. That was a big let down, I felt cheated. How hard would it have been to have actually put the band all the way around the panty-like they implied? They are cut nicely for a short torso and someone with no butt like myself, however, they do run small. I recommend sizing up. I wear a US 12W-14W and purchased the 2x. They fit, but just."
3.0,I like that all my colors are in view but the nails keep falling out
3.0,"This skirt wast too big for me.  I am 5'0"" and got a small size.  The material felt light and comfortable.  I returned it and won't be getting a smaller size, because I wished the skirt was a little shorter and a little slimmer."
3.0,"The bag is small. It will only fit a basic camera model with a small lens attached.<br />No extra room at all. If you have a zoom lens or an extended battery I would not recommend.<br /><br />OTHER NOTES:<br />I am a bit disappointed. I received the product in time and in good condition but it was just not useful to me. I tried to make it work but my camera did not fit properly and I couldn't fit anything else in it. I went to return the item but the seller needed to ""approve"" it first... I described the issue and they denied my return.<br /><br />How disappointing. I wouldn't really recommend the item -- definitely not the seller.  :-("
3.0,Cute. Little hard to shape as hat. More useful as scarf so not as advertised.
3.0,"It is heavy duty type of product, although be careful, it takes forever to put it on you since it doesn’t have Zipper….<br />it has old classic “hooks-on” like 50 of them to buckle up!<br />It didn’t work for me!"
3.0,"Beautiful bag! Just wasn't functional, couldn't get it to stay on my back properly no matter how much I adjusted the straps."
3.0,"Would definitely work better as a tragus or daith piercing vs septum.  It's super cute, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but way to small for a septum ring...unless the piercer pierced you way too low."
3.0,"It's cute, but it's painfully tight to wear. I had to give it to my child. I'm disappointed because I was excited about it."
3.0,This fits great and is very comfortable.  It isn't very cool though for the summer.  It does have a pocket for the carbon filter which is nice and comes with three carbon filters.  It would be great for fall or winter.  My husband is looking forward to using it for fishing and hunting as well :)
3.0,"I wanted a better quality leather, but I am fine with these."
3.0,Such a cute shirt but too small.
3.0,I bought these because the reviews all swear that they are touch screen compatible but that’s simply not true. I would be impressed if anyone is able to use these gloves while using their phone. Disappointing.<br />However they are warm and cute so I’ll give them points in that department. But not at all what I was looking for.
3.0,"They're very pretty, my mom loved them. My only complaint is that the sparkly part was just a sticker, and one of them was peeling off when I got them."
3.0,For the price you can't complain.Keeps good time however the bracelet is cheap.
3.0,Really liked this cover up but it runs really small. Order one or two sizes up!
3.0,Very little stretch  so they fit snuggly.  Need larger sizes.
3.0,strap didnt last
3.0,"This is nice quality for the price, but it isn't as flattering as other wrap dresses I own. It's hard to get the ties to stay in place because they're is only a loop on one side."
3.0,"It was hard to figure out how to get it on because it didnt come come instructions. After I got it on, however, it looked beautiful! I wore it for two days... and then it broke. I was really sad to have to throw it away. I'll be buying another body chain, but not from this company."
3.0,Super cute but I found it to be too tight on my 7” wrist.
3.0,They are very dark. Good for working in Florida sun.
3.0,"Ugh, bras. It's so hard to find a great bra.<br />I am a 34DD and ordered a 34DD. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit. Nice full coverage. I loved the feel of the straps right from the start. They are so smooth and comfortable. And you feel the support. I also love that it breathes well and isn't super thick. The biggest problem with this bra is that it has no lift. My husband thinks I'm not wearing a bra every time I wear this bra. That's not really the look I'm going for. 😭 So while this is the most comfortable bra I own I really, really wish it gave more shape and lift."
3.0,"I guess I thought with the tie it would be more flattering, but the lack of structure didn't do much to flatter my waistline."
3.0,I like the bag I just thought it will be a bit bigger.
3.0,"The bottom of my feet got cold, I had to buy extra insoles. I normally take a 10 so I ordered a 10 and they were too big. No problems sending them back and I ordered a 9. They 9 fit well. Very fast delivery too."
3.0,Bummer these are too big.  The Star Wars ear rings seem to be designed for women not men or unisex.  They are off center with the post and about a CM in diameter.
3.0,Frame was a little bit too large for my face and lenses were loose so that you could hear them rattle when head movements were quick. Optical quality was ok.
3.0,Decent hat.very nice patch.the hat does have black Velcro which is fine but didn't know it went all the way around the base of the hat.but i like the colors .its the only hat ive seen to match a army riding jacket i have.delivery time was a little long but no problem.was well packaged
3.0,Works very well!  Clingy material.
3.0,Nice but hate the tag on back
3.0,"Love these jeans, and the feel...but....BUT.... my complaint is it's just a little too snug near the calve area. (Im thin too....no big calves....?!)  I feel like I'm always pulling down the pant leg and adjusting them. Wish they would have made the calve opening a little bigger. Then it would be perfect!"
3.0,"Got dirty easily and the stitching pills easily. Overall cute, but should be used sparingly to keep in good condition."
3.0,The sweater is very nice but runs small.
3.0,"Decent enough product for value, just kind of a pain of assembly"
3.0,"I purchased this after enjoying the 1st one at Nordstroms for a few years, very expensive but it last well. This new one ripped within a few months if wear, it’s made a bit thinner."
3.0,It came with a stain on it. Super thin. I will update once it is steamed. Will be returning this dress. It's not flattering at all.
3.0,"Seems like it will work for a while, but the fabric does give off a distinct smell. Plan to wash before use. Could be due to toxic chemicals in fabric."
3.0,Shirt fits more snug than I was expecting. I love the colors though and the material is soft. Will probably wear it to sleep in.
3.0,I didn’t expect this to be perfect considering I am bigger chested. But I’m honestly not mad at it. I ordered the 2pk of black ones and unfortunately only received one.
3.0,Cheap material but good for price.
3.0,Beautiful and quality dress but fits small. Slightly tight at tummy.
3.0,They are ok.  But just ok.  I still find it hard to see at night
3.0,"I ordered these for a woman that wears a size 9 and the ordered the correct men’s size according to the exchange between men’s and women’s sizes so I ordered what should have fit, but they were too short and narrow for the intended person."
3.0,The top is adorable and fits true to size. I got the xl and it fits exactly like an xl should. The bottoms are the problem. There is no way these bottoms are an xl. I would say more like a medium at best and they did not say in the description there is zero back coverage. It’s basically like a thong. It’s not just cheeky there’s nothing there. For the price it was worth just getting the top.
3.0,Too new to review except they did what they were supposed to do.
3.0,Quality seems good. Do not like the color. I was expecting more of a yellow/tan but it’s more of a green sage.
3.0,These are nice but the screw on backs are tiny and difficult to attach. If you do not intend on removing these they will be a good choice.
3.0,"The back strap is very small, and the shirt is very loose around the waist. I am also 6' 2"" @ 155 lbs. so that could be why the fit is loose."
3.0,the clock is very nice except for the band is very hard and does not fit easily wrist
3.0,"China is profiting from a pandemic started in China! Now the masks that I am forced to buy for my business are ridiculously priced! $50!! They work and they were available, so for that I gave a few stars."
3.0,"I bought these last January, so this is one year later and today the nose piece snapped while I was swimming.  I take good care of these, rinsing and drying after use.  I don't think they should have broken in one year."
3.0,Order up a size and beware it is shorter in length than it appears in the picture. Very light weight and looks cute on. Just disappointed that it wasn't as oversized as the description states.
3.0,"My child normally wears size 7.5 Wide shoes. I purchased this in 8-9 and it fits her smugly because the strap is so tight. So it doesn’t come off. However it has that extra space on the back and these slip ons are just so bulky in general and I was worried that she would trip. In the end, she refuses to wear them so I have to return."
3.0,"Though it may seem petty the zipper in the back I thought it was going to be silver I wasn’t, it’s a gold tone. The dress itself is not a pure white as advertised it’s an ivory. This was frustrating."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:5146f6a15919cde86a87570b082bb432]] May be perfect for crocs but very hard to get into bubble slides I nearly broke a finger
3.0,On the top it was way to big and on the bottom the legs weren’t long enough it was kinda weird. It was made really cheaply
3.0,Three stars for the seller because I had one delivered broken and one that broke while traveling and I was refunded for them very quick. I like the design and the wheels on them. Not<br />As big as they look but spacious once closed so fill it up alot before closing cause lid has much space. I personally wouldn’t buy it again but the one I have left is still good and sturdy
3.0,They’re fine until you wash them and then they begin unraveling.
3.0,The shoe really has a nice fit. Great customer service
3.0,"This dress is not for the more full-figured and modest woman.  It is clingy and difficult to move in.  However, it is pretty and she liked the look of it initially.  The tie-up collar is cute.  The tiered look is also something she wanted.  We will have to look elsewhere, though, for a higher quality more full-bodied and less clingy type.  Well-made, nice product but did not fit our needs."
3.0,"They are thin material and they scuff pretty easily, but they are decent for the one show I need them for."
3.0,I purchased these MK glass frames to replace a unisex Coach sunglasses that I lost since I could not find the exact replacement on the Coach website.  These frames are somewhat small for a wider face.  I had the clear lens replaced with a gradient sunglass lens so it would change depending on the brightness of outdoors.<br /><br />I will keep looking for the Coach sunglass frame but these will do for now.
3.0,"It seems to be a little cheaper made than some of the other dresses I've ordered here. The material isn't the best quality and it hangs longer in the front than the back. I'm 5'6"" and if I wear it I'm going to have to wear it as a shirt with capri leggings so I am able to move without showing what god gave me!"
3.0,But it was nice
3.0,Hat is cute but runs large. The shield is not as clear as I would like.
3.0,"I purchased this in lack and I was a little skeptical about it...but it's grown on me.<br />I definitely don't like the material at all, it's kind of stiff so the pockets poke out and give me a weird hip shape if the pockets aren't laying right which is hard to ensure as you're moving around. I think the material softened up a bit but not a whole lot.<br /><br />I'm a 34GG...and this is definitely a dress that shows off a lot do the girls but also my bra as well  lol the men I wore it on dates with certainty didn't mind and I didn't either minus the bra showing. I tried it without a bra but it just didn't provide enough support for my own personal comfort.<br /><br />I'm 5'10"" and this fell just at my knee when first received. It did shrink in the dryer a bit but not by much, it hits me maybe an inch or two above the knee now and I can still wear it comfortably.<br /><br />I may see if I can fix the bra showing issue with my current dress, if I can I'll likely order in another color."
3.0,"Nice color, the sizes are loose fitting."
3.0,I'm a little confused because I didn't order this and I didn't receive it and I wasn't billed for it but ur still pops up every time I look at my old purchases I remember getting a Seahawks baby bib but nothing like this I'm pretty sure this was a Seahawk baby bib and now it shows this however i wanted to write a good review for the seahawks stuff i don't know what this is...
3.0,Was disappointed they are too big wont stay on foot ordered7 needed 6 or 6 1/2
3.0,"The rose quartz, amethyst and quartz are a lot bigger than I expected! The interchangeable stones however are crap. The crystal is ok, just tiny. The amethyst is mostly gray and white. The lapis is mostly gray with a tiny bit of blue. The green adventurine is white with a slight green tint. The yellow adventurine is beige. The carnelian is light orange and the red jasper is brown. All stones for the necklace are faded and lackluster. If it weren’t for the bigger stones I would be disappointed."
3.0,if you need them it will do the job
3.0,While they looked great I could not get them on my feet no matter what I tried.  I wear an 8.5. should have ordered up maybe a full size.
3.0,Too tiny for an adult unless you’re quite petite.
3.0,I don't like the handle.  I bought them for the grocery store.  It is not easy to get larger items in the<br />bag.  You need a bag that fully opens.
3.0,"I got the xl, was a bit too baggy on me. Maybe should have went with the large. Top was a bit thicker than I expected too. But all in all a nice jogger suit."
3.0,Lovely and well made hat that is too small for my huge man head. Gave it to a girlfriend. It looked cute and fit her well.
3.0,I do like these slippers and they have enough support for  my plantar fasciitis issue. They are very comfortable but I haven’t had them more than a couple months and they are coming apart unfortunately.
3.0,Somewhat small. Somewhat see through but not noticeable once on. Decent quality.
3.0,Very pretty and supportive but itchy. This bra is not as sheer as some of HSIA other bras and I feel an opportunity was missed  to us a softer material for the inner lining.
3.0,Too thin for my boobs ..maybe i should got bigger size cz my boops come out of it ..straps very thin giving it no support ..if u have small boops this would work for u cz its more for lounge wear than sports bra
3.0,"Beautiful ear rings, but two of them fell apart after a couple days of wear and needed to be super glued."
3.0,I buy a large tshirt and is small i have to buy xlarge
3.0,La talla M me quedo grande.  Lo pedí de acuerdo a la tabla de medidas
3.0,"This is a light weight jacket, not to be worn in moderate to heavy down pour even though it says waterproof. This purchase<br />was for my 13 yr. old. I tried it on and went to the mail box to see if this would be sufficient for her to wear while waiting<br />for the school bus if it rained. It was a light rain out and by the time I got back inside the house water was starting to seep<br />through. I ended up getting another jacket for her to wear, she could use this as a light jacket to keep out the wind."
3.0,Cheaper Quality than I expected
3.0,Looks pretty.<br />Broke almost immediately
3.0,The size looks great on my sons
3.0,okay product; kinda cheap
3.0,"It's nice, but over priced"
3.0,Very bright colors.  My daughter loved it.  The fabric is see through.  Must have a slip to wear it.
3.0,As with most of the discount watch bands the colors are seldom accurate.
3.0,"Item was supposed to come with a charm, my charm is missing and i cant<br />contact customer support"
3.0,Its not what I expected at all. I thought it would be delicate and embroidered. Its a bit clunky and heavy--costume jewlery with bead inserts. Maybe good for costume.
3.0,Sizing is way off. This fits more like an extra large rather than a large. Aside from that the product is good and the shipping was fast. It's just a shame it runs larger than it should
3.0,"Very very slim fit and made of a sort of stretchy, weird polyester fabric."
3.0,The sunglasses were nice but the hinge wore out fairly quickly making the ear bars very lose.
3.0,"Cute jeans, but way too big on my waist. I have to wear a belt with them. Also, the buttons are super loose so I have to be careful when I put the jeans on. I had to use scissors to cut open the button holes as well. But over all, the jeans aren’t bad."
3.0,Cute bralette but very very small.
3.0,"Just received them and have not had a chance to try them out in the cold weather.  The fit nice so the next test is how do will they do in cold weather?  They are expensive and remember they are sold as singles and not pairs so be prepared and order 2 and not expect to receive 2 from your order, they are singles."
3.0,"Great design on the jacket and the bra top fit great, but the jackets lining came unraveled in my right sleeve when trying it on. The pants are just a total miss, too short and super tight like leggings, like those were an xsmall instead of small for sure, and one of the belt loops werent even properly sewn on, pulled on it lightly and it just came loose immediately. Had i gone for a medium size then the pants would have probably fit but the jacket would have been too big. So beware of tiny pants, not for tall gals."
3.0,great for short trips. I have to take a fly with 5 hours scale and this is to big and heavy (two suits inside)
3.0,"Tend to run small, I have a 30&#34; waist and have found medium closer fit than small. RETURNED ITEM. Wrong item sent. Item pictured is bikini and item sent was string bikini, likely a wrong shelf pull."
3.0,Super comfortable but the bottoms have a material on them that comes off within the first few wears and then they become very slippery
3.0,One of the stretchy threads broke right away
3.0,"I wanted to get this to hide my stretched out baby belly. It didn't really do the trick, but it did work better than the Khaya one.  However, my belly wasn't hidden."
3.0,Purchased for myself and they were way too strong. I donated to Lions Club
3.0,"Ordered XL. I normally wear size 12 dresses and pants. This size fits but I had to wear a girdle for it to look decent in the butt area. The dress over all just doesn't look as good as advertised. The ruffles aren't as pronounced. They look droopy to me and the dress is underwhelming, I wasn't excited at all when I tried it on. Sorry. I included a pic that shows what it looks like compared to a purple dress and a burgundy shirt."
3.0,"The frames and the case are a delight, but the quality of the lenses themselves was substandard; HOWEVER...after emailing Speert International about my displeasure with the product and my intent to donate them to charity since they were very inexpensive. Speert unexpectedly issued me a full refund including shipping, without me even asking for one, and they were happy to have the product donated!  That's the second half of great customer service (the first half being a good product).  Way to go Speert International - I'll give you another try."
3.0,"As pictured, came within 2 weeks of ordering.. did break at clasp the first night I wore it but my boyfriend was able to fix it. So far has not broken again."
3.0,Goid quality but they still slip once you get sweaty!
3.0,It's cute. Didn't realize how different the colors were on onesie and pants but its still cute
3.0,Short waisted sweater
3.0,"Very well made. I thought I would like the size, but it is just to small. If you carried only 1 card it would be fine."
3.0,It is easy to breathe through but are two snug for us to wear comfortably for long periods of time. If you are thin they will be ok.
3.0,Great little umbrella! We keep this in the door of our van for when it is raining in the morning and our 5 yr old needs an umbrella for her short walk into her school.
3.0,"I loved the look of this ankle bracelet enough to buy it twice. And,  unfortunately it broke off my ankle each time, the first time I wore it with the first one,  never to be found again.  And the second one broke twice, with my husband fixing it once.  It's sitting in two pieces on my table now.  I just wish it was stronger.  So cute,  but..."
3.0,"The hook eyelet popped off the first time I tied them. Very disappointed. This was my third pair, I returned them. They are some of the most comfortable boots I’ve ever worn but they don’t hold up. My other 2 pair fell apart. They don’t warranty for very long."
3.0,It was smaller than expected. Didn’t hold up in the wash. Cute overall for one use.
3.0,It is way smaller than expected.
3.0,"This appear to be a size medium shirt which is what I typically wear however I usually get talls.  I was under the impression that since they measured you the sleeves would be long enough, that was not the case.  Soft material but I would not buy another."
3.0,Very cheaply made in a hurt my ears because of awful material they were made with it started hurting my ears immediately
3.0,"Good value and they don't irritate my ears MUCH but they do seem to irritate them a little. Mostly just my cartilage piercings which are a little over-sensitive anyway, so it could just be that. They are a bit smaller than I expected, and some of the colors aren't very vibrant. But still pretty, overall."
3.0,"I like the look of the belt, but I know I ordered an XL but I think this is a M...it is way too small."
3.0,The bathing suit is cute but it was so hard to keep the straps hooked in. For a one piece you should be able to slide it on and off and the straps to stay in place. You pull on the straps and all and they popped right off.
3.0,Not as long as I was hoping for and fabric is pretty thin...
3.0,runs small.  print is pretty.
3.0,I wish the material had more structure. In the zipper does show through the shirt. But it's pretty comfortable especially for short-term use
3.0,"well-made product, but &#34;squished&#34; my breasts into a peculiar arrangement, even though I wear other bras nicely in the size I ordered.  Guess I've learned my lesson & will try on a bra before I buy it."
3.0,I ordered another pair because I really liked my first pair of sunglasses. Unfortunately the first pair frame broke after I ordered the second pair. I only had the first pair two months.
3.0,"Definitely go with their sizes, they are spot on.  The graphic is nicely done.  It is thin, but not see through if you are not wearing this with a super tight fit. What I did not care for personally is that it has more of a polyester feel, rather than a cotton feel to it.  While there is some stretch to the material, it has that almost slick feel to it that I do not care for.  But that is just me.  Overall, not a terrible dress, and I will wear it, I'm just not overly fond of the fabric."
3.0,"Pretty much got this purse to meet the &#34;free shipping&#34; cost, but its cute. Didn't have high expectations, but man this is one stiff little purse. I don't imagine much flexibility at all with this thing, or its ability to hold some serious weight (seems too thin/weak). As others have said the zipper doesn't really close either. So far pretty good, but I just keep receipts in it so. yeah.... :D"
3.0,"They were just alright seemed to stay in place, but a little small and my shoe size is around 8 to 8.5."
3.0,"I loved these when I first got them...and then they broke. The lens fell out of the frame and I was not able to put it back in. Unfortunately these are not made very well. If you want to wear them to a music festival or something and not care about loosing them, they are fine."
3.0,The Nike emblem was not of usual quality that you get with Nike clothing bought in store. Sizing was spot on.
3.0,Most large gloves fit me perfectly but these are a bit tight.  These gloves would not work well for shooting - too stiff in fingers. These would okay work gloves or for warmth.
3.0,Compared to other LSAT watches on the market - this is poo.  But cheaper.  You can't set it up to sit in front of you in a test setting - big drawback.  Ended up just making my own:
3.0,They fit a little tight for my arms. Please note I'm 6-0 220 lbs athletic build.. overall the product seems well constructed and durable..
3.0,"Would have been 5 stars but they don’t come labeled with the gauge size, which is fine I can figure it out, I’m only going from a 2g to a 00g, but I can’t even do that now because I got 3 0g ones, and only 1 00g, so I’m going to have to order a separate set of 00g stretchers when I’m ready for that size, which is super frustrating!!!"
3.0,"Great belt, but it's not leather material. Feels like rubber. Comes with a tool to punch extra holes. Says it can be cut if it's too long."
3.0,Smaller than what you think. Still very visible even from a distance though. Doesn’t seem very sturdy since the magnets are small but they do hold up so long as you don’t ride any rollercoasters.
3.0,So the shoes are exactly what I wanted for my little one who's learning how to walk except that I order a 6-9 month show for my 8 month old and they are huge! She really needs shoes like this so I haven't decided if I'm going to return them or see if she can still use them. But when learning to walk shoes that are too big will make it harder for her.
3.0,"They fit snug at first but stretched out and I definitely needed the belt. I didn't care for the belt, too much trouble to open and close so I bought a different belt that works better with a plastic snap open /close buckle. I thought the pants were great for the price and will order them again."
3.0,"It was sized a little small and after one wash, was definitely too small."
3.0,I love the design of the grateful dead zip up hoodie. The only thing I have a problem with is the quality control. When he tried it on for the 1st time he noticed it has a hole in the corner of the pocket from where the stitch just wasn't properly stitched to begin with.
3.0,"This mustard wristlet is okay, but the off color (canary yellow) cheap lining ruins it for me.  The quality is questionable. I would be surprised if it survives more than 10 uses."
3.0,"It is very pretty, but the chain is very fragile and could easily snap.  I tend to wear the same necklace for days or weeks at a time.  This necklace turned my neck green after one day.  Not a necklace for me."
3.0,"This is a cute little cross body bag, although personally I am not big into tassles, but that is just me. It has an inside area for credit cards and money that is very convenient and when you get it in that area is where the straps are also packed into. When you remove them though, this is when you notice the little design flaw, the bag now doesn't really close all the way and you have this gap. I guess it would maybe fit one of the smaller cell phones?<br /><br />Underneath the tassel is another compartment where you can add various things like some lipstick or whatever you like to carry around. Overall this is a fairly small bag so measure before you order. On the back of it is another zipper pocket which is where I would personally keep the credit cards and ID and maybe on the inside have reward cards and the like that are not as critical.<br /><br />It has a nice long strap that allows you to have it across your body. The material is a nice bright red matched with a tan, probably some pleather like material, nothing fancy but this should also not cost you $100+.<br /><br />So besides that design flaw with that gap, it is actually not a bad bag for around the town for a few small items you need. Just not sure why that gap is so severe, maybe if you put it between some heavy weights for a few days it will go away?"
3.0,Printed design not centered as shown in the illustration.
3.0,"It's a little smaller than I expected - which I wouldn't mind much, since it does have some stretch, but the sleeves are a little short on me, which almost never happens because I'm kinda short (5'3&#34;). Definitely order a size up!"
3.0,If you aren't very skinny it will cause that line on your back that looks like it is cutting in.
3.0,They are okay not extremely well mate but nothing like sharp edges or anything like that. Just very very standard nipple rings
3.0,Feel like I'm wearing pajamas
3.0,"Orange is nice color, quality seems fine though I haven't washed it. An extra large always fits me in tops-across the chest is my largest area. This is too tight even before washing. I can't really go through the effort of returning things right now,especially d/t COVID. I needed the item so was disappointed. The rest of the body fit fine, its straight so if you have a belly you could hide it some. Trying to be fair w 3 stars, but linen shrinks so its going to be even smaller probably."
3.0,"Son muy Lindos,, pero Demasiado pequeño, aunque lo pedí 1/2 número más grande ni siquiera me entran .<br />UN DESASTRE DESPUES DE ESPERAR UNA SEMANA...<br />Los devolveré perdí mi tiempo"
3.0,fit was good justoo structured of a style for me.
3.0,Nice size not as faceted as image
3.0,The strap overall has a good looks and is easy to install. After only two months of usage the clip on the buckle came off for no apparent reason. I replaced it with another brand's part and now it's ok and firm.
3.0,It’s baby blue and pink. Looks like a pajama top
3.0,"i am sending this garment back to the seller, just too big for me."
3.0,It said microfleece in the description but looks like it is not although it is soft . The sewing on the edges is not done professionally. The material kept me warm beyond minimum but not as warm as I would like to. The sizing met my expectation.
3.0,Not as large as I  had expected.
3.0,Cute and fashionable and serves it purpose.
3.0,"I love this, fit my son perfect but I noticed as soon as I put it on him the shoulder part was ripped. I love the overall outfit but hate that my product was ripped."
3.0,Loop you tuck tie into came unsewn 1st day. Nice fabric and colors though goes good with many shirts I have.
3.0,Kind of meh. I hate the brand text on the outside. They're not Calvin Klein underwear. This is worn on the outside of my body where people can see it. I don't want your dumb brand text on display as part of my costume.
3.0,I bought this for someone who is a big Evan Hansen but it  was too big for her tiny wrist.
3.0,I bought this watch for my wife.  We waited a couple of weeks for it and when we received it there were no directions on it's features.  Every time she takes it off it stops running and she has reset it when she wants to wear it.
3.0,Can't wear with jeans as the bottom edge ruffles and makes it look like you have a muff2top or spare tire. Not flattering. But wear it with leggings and it looks decent.
3.0,Nice necklace.  However I thought the tooth would be larger in person.  It's quite tiny.
3.0,I believe the band is defective because it doesn’t lock into place.
3.0,I didn't realize how open the sides were.  Not comfortable wearing in public
3.0,"Love this purse! I got the dark red/burgundy color and it looks fantastic. The only reason for 3 stars is that the zipper on an interior pocket ripped out after only a couple of weeks of use. I'm still carrying it, as I only used the pocket for tampons, but still a little disappointing."
3.0,"Incorrect sock set was sent, but needed right away so I used the ones that were sent. Still cute and fit well"
3.0,"The gloves are elegant with the rhinestones on the back of each hand, but the special touch pads on the fingertips are almost useless.  I tried repeatedly to operate my smart phone while wearing the gloves, and when my phone responded to me, it was delayed. So there's no accuracy when entering a pass-code.  It would be much faster to remove the gloves to operate your phone than to try to do it while wearing the gloves.<br /><br />The fabric of the gloves is nicely stretchy, warm-ish and slightly scratchy.  They are suitable for chilly autumn evenings, but they would not be warm enough to wear while scraping snow off your vehicle, if there's a stiff wind, or if they were to get wet.  Also, I wouldn't wear these when carrying a handle-less, smooth coffee mug or while driving on slick roads as they do not have textured grips for holding onto things/the steering wheel.  The gloves are magnets for lint and pet hair, so keep a lint roller handy.  They would likely fit small, medium to medium-large hands, but I'd be cautious ordering these if you have super long fingers or swollen joints.<br /><br />I think these would be best to wear if you were going on a fancy dinner date in the evening with a gentleman who opened all the doors for you so you wouldn't have to touch anything that might get the gloves dirty or that you might risk dropping."
3.0,"Maybe I just have a bigger head than I thought. I ordered a larger. The hat is nice and warm but wasn't loose and baggy as shown in the picture. So, if you want to keep your hairstyle by using a loose hat this isn't the one to purchase."
3.0,"I'm fairly petite but I have big boobs so I was hoping a medium would fit, according to the size chart. When I have tried smalls in the past, the band fit good but the cup size was way too small. These are a bit loose in the band, which I don't mind but they don't fully cover my boobs as much as I would like. They work for when I just want to wear something under a tshirt but if I wear a tank top or something low cut, I'm worried the ladies might pop out."
3.0,"Not very long, very wide though"
3.0,"The hat is very nice quality, and will likely fit the average head, as expected. It's not a bad hat at all. I bought it as a gift for a friend of mine, and while she loves it, it doesn't fit her. Not because her head is too big, but she's got a lot of long, thick curly hair. She put the hat on while her hair was still a little damp so it would fit under the hat better, and &#34;mold&#34; to it as it dried. But even with that, as her hair dried it puffed out and the hat could barely stay on, it was just kinda floating in her hair. Even a tighter ponytail is pushing the hat's limits (the ponytail must be low because the hat is in the way). Unless she straightened or slicked back her hair, I don't see it fitting her well. The elastic should have more stretch that is also tighter, so people with larger heads or lots of hair can enjoy. Better yet, a snapback closure for more comfort and wear options."
3.0,"Overall shape and look is good, and I received multiple compliments while wearing them. The temple is a little short for me and the plastic that covers the rim cracked after a few uses. These glasses are okay for the price."
3.0,"It's very pretty, but the material is a little cheap. One wash definitely changed the look of this top, but it's still pretty!"
3.0,Soft and good quality! I have a tendency to 'wear big' so would have liked if item was baggier!
3.0,"The quality is just what i wanted. My husband wears a 3x without having to size up, but this shirt was too small, I would size up 2 times for it to fit. he couldn't move his arms."
3.0,They are way too soft so they fit weird
3.0,"This dress looks great on me.  However, I am disappointed that it's so thin. People can basically see my legs through the clothes and that really made me uncomfortable when I wore it yesterday. Yes, the dress fit me well, but it was pointless because of the material."
3.0,"This hat is perfect for spending days outside in the sun. It has a draw string to tighten it, but the string slips."
3.0,Sides are cut very low so I had to wear a tank/cami under it. The photo makes it appear to be cut under the armpit but it is down to the middle of my side.
3.0,"This is not as off the shoulder as it looks<br />Cute but not for in public, more for lounging around the house"
3.0,"Fit well, didn't wash well. Faded quickly."
3.0,It arrived on time and is very cute! I ordered a large it was way too small fit more like a small or medium. Doesn’t stretch at all it was too small in my rib area. Probably should’ve ordered a 2xl
3.0,Not my style I look like an old lady
3.0,I love carters clothes however I felt like these shirts fit tight and small. Quality is good
3.0,Too short in the back. Will be returning.
3.0,"This wallet is huge. I can't figure out what happened. I must not have paid attention to the dimensions when I ordered it and just assumed it would be a standard wallet size. It's the size of a clutch bag and almost too big to fit into my purse. I got the wallet in a light blue color and the color is very true to the picture so I am pleased with that. Tons of storage for cards, I get a lot of gift cards and love having ample room to organize them. It has a cute lil' spot for your coins, but the wallet is quite stiff. I'm betting with more use it will start to have more give but it is quite hard to take cards out."
3.0,"Decent but not great, wider than I expected"
3.0,"Super cute, but if your shoe size is above a 7, definitely get the large."
3.0,"Nice, but the picture is so small."
3.0,These rings were meant to be cupcake toppers. They were adorable but had a terrible Oder that contaminated all of our cupcakes. There is no label about food safety. Do not use these around food. They even contaminated the ones that didn’t have a ring in top.
3.0,Medium raw material
3.0,"Beautiful pendant but the picture is misleading. The chain is very long, not at all like it is in the picture. Will have to buy another chain."
3.0,I had to purchase pocket chargers separately. It’s pretty small. On the upside it can be used for either left or right
3.0,Hardly dark brown as advertised.  More of a green gray that can only be worn with a few outfits.
3.0,"The yellow color is perfect, the length was great and the cut is flattering. HOWEVER! The arm holes are huge and there is no way to tighten the straps to make a bra not show. If you have tailoring skills to fix that, this dress might be perfect for you!"
3.0,Sooooooo tight
3.0,"Nice outfit, but I'm short and this is looooog on me 4’11 11/12 order lg."
3.0,I LOVE the look and feel of all my 90 degree yoga pants. I must already have 5 pair. But I always like to get a few new  pairs every year. I wasn’t paying attention  and ordered the ones with pockets and that didn’t appeal to me. I returned and placed the correct order.
3.0,They fit really tight behind the ears and give me a headache.  I do like how dark the lenses are though.
3.0,"I’m 5’1 125lbs with an hourglass figure, first I bought a green s/m and it was too tight but the length was perfect. I returned it for a m/l which was too long but fit nicely around my thighs and butt. There was excess material around my waist though. I wish they made just a medium size in between what they offer in size. I also feel like these bottoms crease easily where your leg and pelvis meet creating that very visible “V” where your hooha is. Sweat becomes visible as well through the material."
3.0,"This dress fit well, and had nice fabric, but it looked a bit frumpy and old fashioned (in a bad way) on me. Others in the review pictures look very classic and elegant in the dress, but not me. I had to return it."
3.0,"The material of this jacket is unmatched it's thick, soft, and very warm. The sleeves are a bit short so you may want to order a size larger for your child. Also the cuffs of the sleeves are very wide causing a loose rest around the wrist."
3.0,The sweatshirt has a beautiful print. The print is the same on the front as on the back. My son absolutely loves this sweatshirt. The material is more like a thick t-shirt material. Not made to keep a child warm but definitely an attractive sweatshirt.
3.0,Some of the pins don't have enough coverage on the pointy end to make this safe for a young child to wear.
3.0,Purse was fine- seems well made- was too large for my preference and felt the handle was too short. I sent it back because of size
3.0,"Had to reattach 4 out of six with hot glue gun because they were needed for parade. Otherwise did the job for one night. Looked adorable over the littles' hats, but could be worn by adults as well."
3.0,It was a little smaller then expectrd.
3.0,i did not like the material. very big for a 12 months.
3.0,"I have ordered other maxi dresses from PattyBoutik that I LOVE so I saw this one and figured it would be the same. It's not the same material as the other dresses which was a bit disappointing. It's an ok dress but since it's mostly cotton it stretched out as I wore it and ended up having to pin it at the top so my bra wasn't hanging out. I also will say that the fabric isn't soft, more like a tshirt material.<br />It's long enough and fit true to size when I first put it on, but it will stretch out. I bought a small and I'm 5'5&#34; 120lbs."
3.0,"This is a cute and flattering dress that fits true to size, but be cautious with what color you choose. I chose the pink polka dot, and as you can see in my photos, my entire bra is completely visible through the fabric. Not the outline of my bra….the entire bra. You can see the pattern, the band, the straps…all of it. Very frustrating bc this is a dress I would normally wear to work, but there’s no way I would feel professional with this thin see-through fabric.<br /><br />The bottom has a bit more coverage, due to the two layers of fabric from the wrap detail on the skirt.<br /><br />Overall, this dress looks okay, but feels inexpensive. The fabric is too thin even for the affordable price. I plan on layering a tank underneath, but worry it will look awkward or that I will constantly be adjusting it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would not recommend this dress. Maybe in a darker color there would be less sheerness, but the pink is definitely not a good choice.<br /><br />For reference, I’m 5’7, 175lbs, and pear shaped. I wear a large in most tops and an XL in bottoms. I prefer my clothes to be formfitting. I ordered this in a large and it is true to size."
3.0,I didn't like the fact that the band didn't come with the small piece that holds the band down.  so when you're wearing the watch the excess slack is just hanging there.
3.0,"The waist on these leggings are just too tight and uncomfortable. Also, after the first wear, mine had a hole in them. I would say they are not the best quality out there..."
3.0,"The purple color was very vibrant and beautiful, and the set looks just like pictured but unfortunately runs large (I wear a size XS or a 2 in brands like Fabletics/Lululemon, this XS was too big on me). The fabric is on the thinner side with absolutely no compression around butt, hips and thigh area (probably because it's so thin?)"
3.0,"This product looked much better on the picture, than in person, but since it was a birthday gift and we didn’t have time to return it, we kept it. The necklace arrived tangled, so I had to untangle it and it’s not easy to read the inscription. Also, not sure how long it will last before it fades. It might make a nice gift for a young child, but not an adult."
3.0,I so wanted this headband to be perfect but it came and it was very small ears and they did not stay in place.
3.0,I like the shirt and the style but is pretty big. I cant wear it with shorts because it hangs over them and covers them and if i tuck it in the bottom is so large that it is poofy. I love it with jeans but wanted it to wear in the summer so i'm a little sad it didnt work with shorts.
3.0,"I got this as a gift for my dad and though I am not using the watch, I am not thrilled with it. It is a beautiful pocket watch that works well, but there are a few things that you should know before buying this.<br /><br />1) the hands are VERY hard to see. I have 20/20 vision and still have a hard time seeing the hands on this watch. The reason being is the hands are lacy cut-outs that are placed over a working-gear background. There is too much busy detail that makes it hard to read. I do not mean to be rude, but for older people who cannot see as well, this might not be a great watch.<br /><br />2) the &#34;luminous&#34; dial is just a glow-in-the-dark face. Being this is a &#34;pocket&#34; watch, it will not be in any type of light to allow the face to charge. Even if it does charge in sunlight, you will get a max of 10 min out of the glow, which is kind of useless.<br /><br />It is still a nice watch and I like the winding feature (no more batteries). It is a fantastic price and the seller got it to me VERY fast. It came in a nice gift box and was packaged securley in both foam and bubble wrap.<br /><br />I did end having an issue with the watch when it got to me, but the seller was more than fair in their resolution. Also, they contacted me back immediantly when I did reach out and for that, I am a happy customer :)<br /><br />I will keep this watch even though I am not 100% thrilled with it and perhaps I can find a different person to give it to, but I think I will be looking for a another one to give to my dad."
3.0,I love the color but to shirt is very short
3.0,"Product arrived promptly and was incredibly well packaged. The sunglasses came with a fabric sleeve, a lens cleaning cloth, and a hard case. Unfortunately they are so big that they won't even stay on my nose. I can put my hand between my face and the frame on each side of the glasses while I am wearing them. They slide right off my nose. They would be good to wear over prescription glasses. I suppose. Very decent product for the price but they were just too big."
3.0,"Style wise, I loved it, this is my second dress from hotouch but unlike the first one which is the dark green where it came perfect color and material wise, thicker and good quality, this purple color had a thinner fabric you can see through, but otherwise the style was great"
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than my normal size- I wear a 12-14 and I ordered a US 18- Fine in the shoulders and chest but too short and the sleeves around the wrist are so small (tight) there is no way I can roll them up the way the shirt is  made to be worn. But the sleeves were good at the upper arm which surprised me.
3.0,Nice summer dress. Good material. However I had to return it because size small looked way to be on me.
3.0,I ordered these for my granddaughter but they fit me! I wear a 7.5 women's shoe. The slipper themselves are great but the sizing is a huge issue. Not sure what to do now.
3.0,"Comfortable, but definitely not as compressive as previous stockings of other brands I've purchased in Med/Lg sizes. If purchased again, would try smaller size."
3.0,Si es ideal para regalar a mi hija pero lo malo que no me llegado 😭 orcbcc-fashion
3.0,The fit was really too large and I'm not  as fond of this hat as I am of others.  It flies off if there is a breeze.  I had hoped it had a little more color than the picture indicated but it's really rather bland.
3.0,Very pretty but much smaller than I had hoped. About size of quarter so will be lost in my longer hair unless I pull it up:(
3.0,"If you're looking for a warm fall/winter open sweater- this isn't it. It's very light and thin. Seems cheaply made as I've worn it once and found I've made a trail of frays from the tassels. However, it is cute and matches pretty much everything in my closet so overall not a bad purchase, just not quite the material I expected."
3.0,This gloves are pretty delicate. I had to reinforce the stitches because they started popping loose.
3.0,This jacket is nice. I liked the design and quality which is why I was really disappointed when it did not fit. I knew I was talking a chance on the size when I bought if from the reviews I read. I got a 5X  size and really fit like just a little bigger than XL. Bottom like if you are a 300 pound and up guy don't waist your money on this jacket. If you are a small guy then you won't be disappointed with your purchase just by the jacket about 3 size bigger than usual. For the price the jacket is nice. I kept it and gave it as a gift too a smaller friend who love it.
3.0,"Good shorts except for elastic which is not  anchored down and so it tends to twist and fold up, which is annoying. I'm gonna try to sew it in place."
3.0,Followed size chart and it was very large
3.0,It was a cool t-shirt for the day. But the graphic didn't hold together so well.
3.0,"Fit was a little smaller than expected. I love anything Batman-related and have a ton of bat-themed clothes, so it's hard for me to pass things like this up. These caught my attention because they stood out from the others a bit with their colors and designs. Super cute, just wish they'd been a bit stretchier. Way too expensive for what you're getting though, and I definitely would not purchase again."
3.0,"A little thin but very comfortable. Hoping they hold up. Very long, had to hem them"
3.0,It came broken..
3.0,"It is cute and decent quality, but save yourself the money and just go by a regular black cardigan. I was expecting full length but this is crop length. And there's nothing special about it it's just an ordinary crop length cardigan."
3.0,"Fast shipping. Great style, if you're a man and it fits. False advertisement. This is not a woman's mask."
3.0,I wore it as a shirt ( lol)
3.0,"I like the shirt but not the material , it's like a fake silk , wasn't expecting that. I've warn it once and have had it a few months now."
3.0,"I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 220. I bought a size 18. Perfect fit for my waist/hips area. Super excited to see that they fit and I could have something cute to wear on vaca soon. Until I looked at my calves/ankles. The pictures show this pant hitting the model's lower calf/above the ankles. There are no mentions of inseam length. I wanted a pant that hit me on my legs just as pictured in the model. Nope. These go all the way down to just barely below my ankles."
3.0,"First, there was no clasp on the necklace, and the chain was too short. I do not like chokers, which I think that was."
3.0,Jacket is great for the price.  Sizing runs small.  Ordered the biggest size possible and can't fold my arms across the chest without ripping the jacket.
3.0,"Beautiful tie, but is black and silver, not black and white."
3.0,"Product thinner than expected but the customer service was great, when the order needed to be corrected."
3.0,"Nice looking.<br />Doesn't stretch, but fits well."
3.0,Good idea but not well executed. Some might say I have small wrists but still these things are huge. Still going to keep them and put a stitch in them to make them smaller. Neat designs.
3.0,I ordered these a little less than 3 months ago and they're coming apart. I keep finding threads from them tangled in my laundry. It's really too bad because they fit so perfectly. They feel seamless and smooth. Perfect apart from the falling apart thing.
3.0,"It's fine, but definitely not solid silver."
3.0,I purchased this item to wear inside my front waistband . The plastic clip broke off after about a month.
3.0,"First let me say the quality is five stars ⭐️  ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️  The reason I gave it 3 was because of its sizing. I wear a women’s size 8.5 - 9.5 depending on the shoe. I ordered the size that according to the sizes listed should’ve fit me. When I received them they were a good inch too big for me. I returned them and reordered them in the next smaller size and am waiting to receive them, hopefully they’ll work."
3.0,I have another DJT shirt that I really love. The lace make this one look a little cheap. I wear it as an around-the-house shirt. Fits well. The fabric feels nice against my skin. It's comfortable.
3.0,"Very cute dress. Just a little tight in the bust area. Ordered a large. Im 5'5 160 lbs 38 C cup. Wouldn't recommend for a busty lady. Very modest cut, a little short if you want to wear with a petticoat."
3.0,These earrings were bigger then I expected. They are very pretty. I hope they last.
3.0,loved the look of the dress but I wear a size 10 and the medium was way too small. Dress has to be hand washed and it said the color may transfer.
3.0,Fabric is poor quality
3.0,Needs to fit more snugly.
3.0,"The frills at the bottom are a little too &#34;frilly&#34; for me. Also, it is really big and has no shape to it. It does the job but isnt flattering at all."
3.0,Glasses seem OK after only 3 day.  I ordered the brown/amber lenses and got grey.
3.0,"Hello.  I happen to think this is a nice blazer.  I like the fit and the buttons.  I especially love that there's a pocket on the inside, of it.  I wish it had pockets, on the outside, too, but it's still nice.  I am 5'4"" and I weight 125 lbs, so the 4 reg., fits, well.  Hope this helps.  Thanks."
3.0,"Purchased for my teenage daughter, pendant a lot smaller than I pictured, wished it was a tad larger. Overall - adorable but definitely for a tiny petite person."
3.0,Really nothing like the picture it's very long
3.0,These are a beautiful pair but they are SO TINY.  I'm too nervous to stop making sure they don't ease out of my ear piercings.
3.0,"I have almost given up on trying to find compression socks that fit comfortably.  These are almost there but just as all the others the tops are strangling my leg.  They are so tight at the top they are cutting off the circulation and cutting into my leg.  My calf is 15"".  The calf part is good.  It does provide support and is firm enough to help with swelling and pain.  So I have had to cut off the tops just like in all the other compression socks.  If only they would make some without the tops being so tight."
3.0,Didn't like it.
3.0,This doe not come with a hooded cloak as the description says. Also XXL was not big enough for me and it’s not available in a larger size. This item is maybe a large US sizing. Going to see my seamstress to see if she can alter it to fit me.
3.0,Cute but sizes run small
3.0,Was happy to receive it but the clasp broke after two days!  I'm bummed.  :(
3.0,"Really pretty, but definitely for a child or a head scarf only. Wish I could give more stars, but was disappointed in how tiny it was. I did give it to my daughter to wear during Sabbath tho, and she really likes it."
3.0,"As others mentioned, it runs quite small so order a size or two up. Almost seemed like someone took it home, washed it, then returned it since the tag was all scrunched up and the print was also a bit wrinkled. The gift's recipient liked it though"
3.0,"This dress was cute and comfortable – perfect for our themed mystery dinner. However, after using the belt once, it fell apart. The pattern with roses also has strange birds that look like penguins, which I did not realize when I originally purchased the dress. The blue is a bit lighter than I expected, and the bosom fits a bit loosely, but it's still a great dress! Lightweight, cute, and comfortable."
3.0,a little too small for my hands
3.0,It is not bad but not as expected.
3.0,"I purchased this product twice; Once to use as a gift bag for Mothers day (My mom and Husband's mom), and once for myself.  They worked well as gift bags and Mothers' loved them.  It was something different than using traditional gift bags.<br /><br />I used the pink/yellow one for about one month as a work bag.  It carried my small purse, water bottles and lunch.  Immediately upon use, the handles started slipping through the first hole layer.<br />I used large hair clips to stop this, and continued using the bag.<br />  After about that 30 day mark, the lining of the bag began ripping.  After another 15 or so days, the lining was completely shredded.  I chalked it up to the water bottles being too heavy on the stitching.<br /><br />I'm using the second bag now, and am on week 2.  I'm using the hair clips again to keep the handles from slipping through; however, the lining is holding up thus far.  I'm also carrying less weight in the bag.<br /><br />I purchased a backpack to use as a replacement when this bag is unusable.<br /><br />Over all, I'm happy with the purchase and would buy again to use as cute gift bags. They're large and spacious.  I also recommend these bags for beach trips, if only carrying light weight items, such as towels and sunscreen."
3.0,I went with a size bigger (I'm a small) based on reviews. I got a Medium but am exchanging it for a LARGE. The sizing is way off. I hope it fits this time. You can see the tag on the back because the white is a little see-through in the back but it has pretty good coverage in the front which is good!
3.0,Blurry through plastic no matter how we have cleaned it.
3.0,These are not good as work gloves if you bought them for that purpose. They ripped and tore in a day.<br /><br />If you're buying them for very light duty then they'd be perfect. But jot for work.
3.0,"Really liked this jacket , nice color and material but the zipper broke."
3.0,"One of the balls started to go bronze after about a week, but the rest stayed gold. I assume it has something to do with my teeth whitening routine, since it was JUST the top ball"
3.0,Cheap. Only kept a few pairs. Not impressed.
3.0,really cute jacket but was wayyy too small for me. im a size small and ordered a small. Im 5'3 and 125 pounds. the sleeves were wayy too short and i could barely zip the jacket at all. cute to re-gift though or donate to someone else.
3.0,"My torso is a little long compared to the model, so it was a bit short, that didn't matter much to me, however it is very small in the chest area, i don't have LARGE boobs but even mine weren't covered very well."
3.0,Cool looking but longer than I like.
3.0,"this itemm came in a few days in a resealable platic bag.. works great cleaning silver, but I was disappointed with the small size.. when i reread the description, I see they offer a larger one which would be better"
3.0,very small more for a kid
3.0,Water resistant but a little small
3.0,"While these are cute, you will not get what is pictured.  That was a dissapointment.  They all seem to be made ok."
3.0,Cute sweater but the arms are too short. I don’t have long arms either so the cut is just off in the arm length.
3.0,Looks great and the GF loved it. Lasted about 1 year for the price it was worth it.
3.0,Good products for the price.
3.0,Sleeves were tighter than expected.
3.0,"Not so ugly, but it is warm."
3.0,I actually like the colors in this one better than some of the similar ones that I have seen and ordered. I do feel that this is a bit too small for my taste but I do intend to wear it. I think it will work to add a little color to a casual outfit. I have sent in a picture with it placed on a penny so that you can compare it's size.  The size makes this more suitable for a teen or pre-teen in my opinion. I feel like because of the size of the pendant it probably should have been a bit of a lower price.  I don't think I would have paid $11.00 for something that might tarnish and knowing exactly how small it is.
3.0,"It is hard to tell this is real leather.  No label in bag says it. I think it may be bonded leather - a thin layer attached to a different surface. However, it is attractive and I like the size.  Not a huge tote but big enough to hold all I need. Long enough handle to carry on shoulder and a sturdy adjustable shoulder strap too if you want crossbody.  But the zippers are sewn loosely and take two hands to work well. If the main zipper had been sewn tightly across the very top of the bag this would have been a really nice tote."
3.0,"This is a very nice bag, I love it, but somehow it got the one have a spot no way to clean on the bottom!"
3.0,Nice pajamas but 3 stars because the elastic waistband was so tight I had to remake it. I had ordered a size up because I like loosely fitting pjs.
3.0,"I loved the style and material but these compression pants were toooooo, small.  XL of these compression pants is equivalent to size MED."
3.0,"Dress does not match photo, specifically the back of the dress. The back of the dress in the photo drops lower than what it actually is. Also looks more fitted in the photo."
3.0,"I really loved this dress but it shrunk significantly on the first wash. Make sure to check the tag to see if it’s machine washable. Other than that the dress is great for hot summers, the material is light, almost sheer, but in desert heat it works to keep you cool. I ordered a Size small, which fit a little tight in the bust but nothing major. For reference, my measurements are 34” 28” 38”, n weigh 130 at 5’4”."
3.0,Odd sizing and not a soft cotton like pictured.
3.0,"Bought for my wife, she loves the necklace! However, I bought it as a present and I am presently out of the country. I wanted to surprise her with this by having it gift wrapped and having a gift message attached.<br /><br />I'm extremely upset that even though I requested gift wrapping, it was only wrapped in bubble wrap, And the gift message was found on the receipt.<br /> I travel frequently and always use Amazon to send my wife gifts, this is the first product to not have that extra touch when requested.<br /><br />Side note:  I've purchased toilet paper as a gag gift in the past  and even that received gift wrapping and a separate note for the message."
3.0,Looks nice. Runs too long and big. Had to return. Needed smaller size.
3.0,not adjustable so wasn't a good fit on a somewhat smaller than average head?<br />No problem with shipping though!
3.0,"I ordered a size too small by accident, gave it to my daughter fit her great, the quality was okay, price was good so kept it just to have in case she needed it."
3.0,"Very loose and floppy. Love the colors, but it doesn't fit as I had hoped. Sleeves don't stay rolled up. Very sloppy."
3.0,"The sole was a quality rubber, the pink toe/foot fabric is well made, but the mechanism to make it fit and stay on the human foot is really lacking.  There are flimsy plastic straps (like the ""invisible bra straps) that are intended to be adjustable, but it's not clear how to make them fit the foot and stay on.  We ended up using small zip ties, which worked for photos, and then for the portion of the event where our player had to walk around... regular shoes.  That was disappointing.  (n the photo you can see that the back has slipped off the feet.)"
3.0,Really heavy and we should have gotten a pair with more wheels. The one wheel is very hard to actually roll on. The lights are great and my child has fun trying to roll hence the 3 stars.
3.0,It is beautiful. I wish it had a tag or card that read it was a real Irish 4 leaf clover for my friend who is getting it for Christmas.
3.0,It’s cute but one of the metal ends came out of the umbrella after using it just a couple of times.
3.0,The picture can be desisive but i think a great buy.  Maybe a bit expensive for the price.
3.0,Red color is off. Appears orange.
3.0,It was no way near the size that was specified.  I also oversized with these type of items because the elastic gets too tight and even going well oversized it did not close in the front
3.0,"A bunch of these didn't work or only worked intermittently. Could be expected from the price, I guess. still a little frustrating."
3.0,Definitely a knock off of the original. No brand tag. Armpits are very large in this also.
3.0,I bought this rug in hoping for it to be similar to the original Aladdin rug. It is smaller than a welcome home mat and is made of a super thin material that the design got printed on. The rug does not stay in place because there is no grip on the bottom. Do not reccomend.
3.0,smashed flat and does not come with feather or ribbons
3.0,good for what i wanted them for
3.0,"I've had the jacket a month and it is warm but all the stitching is starting to come out. One of the zippers fell off the pocket within 2 weeks.  I know it's on the cheaper side but I thought it would at least last through 1 winter, not 1 month."
3.0,"The bracelets were cute but one was misspelled. ""No pai, no gain"". Very disappointing."
3.0,"just received this in the mail. I am 5'5, 130lbs and ordered a small. It looks really cute and the material is better than what I expected. However, I feel like its almost a petite size. I would like it to be a little bit longer. I am glad I didnt order a larger size though, because I think it would have been too baggy."
3.0,The pants fit like joggers- its an overall a cute look. My daughter is 3-1/2 years old I got her the 4t and it was a little small on her. I would order a size up.
3.0,It's small like the size of a nickel
3.0,"The color is nice and so is the material but for me it ran rather small. I had to return it, without any difficulties. This"
3.0,Material is soft fabric. Not a real jacket for outer ware.
3.0,My daughter likes it but too tight
3.0,Little flimsy but will work
3.0,It was just really small. I bought it for my 11-year-old ended up having to give it to my seven-year-old.
3.0,"When the shoes state “orthopedic”, I am unsure if they really are.  They look great and stylish and a size 46 equals size 13, which was a perfect fit.  They felt great for the first couple days, they became very uncomfortable.  I suffer from neuropathy and my feet “bitch” if they have to wear the same shoes two days in a row."
3.0,The material is like a swimsuit almost
3.0,"This really is the cutest shoe — the pattern and colors were perfect for what I wanted and I really wanted a slip on for summer time. However, these really do run big (my son said they looked like clown shoes) so I had to return.  And of course, they do not have the half size I need now."
3.0,"I purchased these for my husband and they didn't fit his face. If you are of average size, these may be fine for you."
3.0,Color from picture is way off. It is a BRIGHT orange. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,"It is a lot more delicate that it looks in the picture, and it is flat, picture makes it look like it is more 3-D. Will keep, but disappointed that it doesn't match the picture."
3.0,"i like the frames so much that i bought 3 pairs , and all 3 pairs cracked in the same spot. i wish they were more sturdy, i even keep them in a case and take car of them, they break very easily."
3.0,I love that these are cozy and have wool in them but they don't seem to be very well made and they constantly falling off my kids feet and don't have any non skid protection.
3.0,"It does the job much cheaper than a sleeve designed to cover tattoos. However it is a little large (even for my overweight self) and slides down. It is a little translucent, but it isn't too bad."
3.0,"I ended up returning.  Not bad at all for the price, but the sequins were loose as soon as I took it out of the bag and it was itchy/uncomfortable on.  Fit was good but the slip underneath was super short so that made it look a little cheaper.  If you're debating, I'd say it's worth a shot - very easy to return and refund came right away."
3.0,"One broke almost immediately, but have had no problems with the others yet"
3.0,This item would look much better if they didn't vacuum pack to ship. Vacuum packing totally squashed the pile and left wrinkles in a garment that should be wrinkle proof. I would have given this 4-5 stars if they hadn't ruined it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It fits as expected<br />Soft<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cuffs could be tighter
3.0,"while it is nice, the sleeves are too small for my arms.<br />I waited too long, so I won't be sending it back. It'll just take up space in my closet."
3.0,Gave to a friend for BDay give she like it I saw her use it they outher Day I won
3.0,Cheaply made. Would b ok for a swim suite cover. I returned this item because the color was like a burnt orange and I was expecting red.
3.0,"This purse is exactly what I was shopping for.  I love the compartments and my iphone fits well.  But... the vinyl is so thin, it tips over a lot.  It won't stand up!  So if the snap isn't fastened my phone will fall out.  I wouldn't purchase again and I'm shopping for a replacement."
3.0,"These socks have no tag or product description with them at all, so it's impossible to know what they're made of but it is a VERY LOW PERCENTAGE OF COTTON. They stretch and fit snug or tight, but after washing they shrank to literally half the size they were. I don't really like these new multi material blends they are using for socks these days. They are thin though and not bad for sport shoes/running. Thin cool warm weather sock - which I needed."
3.0,Didn't like the presentation
3.0,Runs very large!! Had to return
3.0,This ring is much larger than I expected. The rose is huge. Heavy.
3.0,It was shipped with a tear/snag that I can’t fix. It’s also a lot bigger  than I thought it would be on me. I’m keeping it because it’s soft and  warm but I wish it didn’t have the flaw and wasn’t so big.
3.0,The shirts were too loose for what I wanted. I even ordered a size smaller than I use.
3.0,"I like the shirt and I thinks it good quality.  Very soft comfortable fabric and it fits nicely.  However,  the color description is pink but it is actually a light orange color. I photographed it with a pink shirt next to it so you could see the contrast.  I’m returning and ordering a white one instead."
3.0,I like the suit. Just a little loose in the top. Not much support.
3.0,"I bought 2 other nightgowns from Del Rosa. They were 100% cotton and were  nice and soft .  This one is 100% cotton, but not as soft.<br />I was a little disappointed, but I kept it anyway.  The other 2 nightgowns were patterned material and made in Cambodia.  This white one was made in China."
3.0,"Way too small even-though I ordered my waist size. I was amazed on the great quality, but it was also too long for me even-though I have a long torso."
3.0,These are so adorable! I just love them. But I had to buy 3 pairs before I got to the right size. A 10 and my daughter is just barely into size 8. With the front the way they are and not being Velcro the entire show I think makes his run narrow. So if your child has wide feet I would not recommend these otherwise go up at least a size or two. I had to go up 2 sizes in my daughter doesn't have very wide feet.
3.0,much smaller than expected. 3xl fits like an XL-very disappointed
3.0,It fit and after a few wears the zipper broke:/
3.0,Nice shirt but fits tight in arms and shoulders. Runs on small side and i even went up a size due to reviews
3.0,Boots are holding up since Xmas but I would not recommend them for children to play in. I feel like the brand name version would have held up better.
3.0,Didnt sit how id like. A looser fabric. Stiff. The size is right. Jusy the fabric was eh
3.0,"i lost it a couple times and now idk where it is. although it hurts and its uncomfortable , it also comes off. you should try to make the tip like a circle small sponge so it doesnt leave a mark and hurt your skin . thanks"
3.0,I am giving this product 3 stars because I love the top and how it fits. However the bottoms were not as pictures and were tiny.  I have w black bottom I can wear with the top so to me it was worth the price just for the cute top!
3.0,"Armholes are cut too high so do not wear the black with deodorant.  I am a 38d and the medium is fitted in the waist area but a little tight across the chest.  If you want a fitted sweater I would choose a different brand.  Otherwise, size up if you are a c cup or higher.  The knit is well made, substantial.  Feels expensive. I will buy again but in a larger size"
3.0,"It looks like the price paid.  I wouldn't say it was for an adult, but more from age 10-16, frankly.  A little too insubstantial for a woman."
3.0,Turns green fast but otherwise good.
3.0,Really pretty earrings and pretty easy to get on.
3.0,Links were very hard to adjust. Wound up taking to jeweler and they charged me $10!
3.0,Wasn't what I pictured.... they are much smaller and very light in weight as if they are not metal. Feels like a chip instead of a metal charm as expected.  Not satisfied but don't feel like going through the motions to return it.
3.0,"Fit and quality was fine, but gave me short pilgrim dress vibes... so I returned."
3.0,Very pretty but the jewels fall out.  Happened to both I bought and used as stack rings
3.0,"You get what you pay for. My daughter was thrilled with the look and feel of these boots; I, however, wasn't pleased to see that crease marks showed up after one wear, and the sole feels very flimsy. I expected as much, though, for the price."
3.0,"Very attractive nightgown for a little toddler princess, but the sizing is disappointing.  My niece wears a 3T in everything else, but even the 4T of this nightgown is small.  It is tight in width and short in length. We won't get past the summer using this one."
3.0,"My husband and I both got one of these wallets in May. We love the concept and the style, but we are very disappointed in the durability of these wallets. After approximately six months of use, the plastic pockets in my wallet are splitting along their sides, and the plastic latch on my husband's wallet has stopped latching (it is not cracked or broken, it simply will not catch). We have both been very careful to carry a minimum of cards in the wallet and have not overloaded them or subjected them to unreasonable wear. We both find these wallets to be ideal and convenient, but are shocked at the fragile materials used, which shorten their lifespan. These wallets are expensive, and it is absurd to have an impact-proof metal shell with a feeble plastic latch and innards."
3.0,It was smaller in width as expected but still like it.
3.0,If you’re considering these you should know they’re more like jeggings than jeans. I ordered a single size down and they’re still big in the stomach area. For the price you might as well go to the mall. The seams are frayed and the back pockets have string hanging on the outside. I went to the mall and bought an actual black pair of these jeans so I’m just going to wear these around the house. They are comfortable and breathable but probably not the the exact jeans you’re looking for
3.0,I wanted a chunkier belt.
3.0,"A soft silky fabric to the touch and lined at the way through. 3 layers on the front, 2 in the back, the shoulder straps are 1.5"" wide and join 2 elastic for each shoulder making it an intricate look in the back with many crossing points.<br />The technical details, the sides, are only 5.5"" total, a little too short for my preference and breast size. The width right under the arms is too wide.  The neck line is a little too high for when I sweat, having it 1 inch lower would feel better.<br />The elastic in the back that crosses from under the left arm to the right shoulder, and vice-versa would need an adjustable buckle to  be more effective. The last thing, the cups are half loose in the right or left sides, even when washing by hand, they turn around a lot, UNLESS you're supposed to remove the sponge and re-insert after washing it separately. That's my best option actually."
3.0,"I am not top-heavy--I carry my fat evenly. I could not even get this dress down past my shoulders, but if I had, it would have been too tight in the arms and bust. Dress is probably cute on those it fits, but I didn't care for it enough to exchange. Appears well made, arrived as expected. Rating based on sizing."
3.0,Roll up while moving around
3.0,"I ordered a size large( based on other reviews) for my 100 lb 5’6” daughter. While the overalls fit ok through the chest and hips they are quite a bit shorter than pictured. Odd cut, I must say. The weight of the overalls is good and they are cute otherwise. I think they are meant for elves though."
3.0,They are VERY wide.  Came up in a children's search for glasses.  These are not for children
3.0,Love the dress and fit.  The blue is very turquoise so be careful with that - wish I bought it in black.
3.0,"Kind of works, doesn't count steps as accurately as a wristband. However, this will count steps when your arms aren't swinging such as pushing a shopping cart."
3.0,"Everything about the fabric is nice, but it is too short nose to chin and too long ear to ear, for my face.<br />A small pet-peeve, the cut end of the fabric is untuck (Frays exposed). There is no backstitch (see pic), allowing the thread to unravel."
3.0,"Don't wear this if you're expecting any kind of performance or shield against the harsh elements of cold, rain, snow, etc. these are just cute looking boots to wear in happy weather."
3.0,The material is too cheap
3.0,"This is a beautiful sweater. The rich burgundy color and cable design are pretty. However, I wore it at work today and it kept falling off my shoulders. You can imagine how annoying this was for 7.5 hours. I want to love it, but that factor alone forces me to return it. I would need linebacker shoulders to keep this in its proper position all day."
3.0,The yoga waistband fit much tighter than expected especially in relation to the sizing of the rest of the skirt. Comfortable material.  Love the pockets.
3.0,"The pants are soft to the touch but I am 5'1 and these pants drag the ground. Granted I do wear boots and heels since the season has changed but these pants were entirely too long. Just to be graphic, the pants stops underneath my boobage area and still drag the ground."
3.0,"This is a great, cheap watch if you have time to go to the jeweler and get it sized. I did not and could not remove the links on my own so I sent it back. The only other issue is that the links are covered in a blue plastic, so they aren't blue metal as it appears in the photos. The rest of the watch actually looks pretty nice."
3.0,For the price this is a good pick can wear it with a few things.
3.0,"This item is really pretty, doesn't look like real gold though. Also, the picture is quite misleading, as it looks like it is a rose gold color, but in reality it is a yellow gold."
3.0,Appliqué is plastic feeling and cheap looking
3.0,I like the design of the hat. The drawback to the hat is the brim. The brim is very stiff with a unnatural  feel.
3.0,"Nice looking slippers at a good price. The quality seems decent. However, the slippers fit a little tighter than I expected."
3.0,"The top fits true to size, the pants are too big/long. It is definitely not red, white and blue. More of an orange color."
3.0,"Too long. I don’t want a dress that goes to my knees<br />5’4” , ordered a large and a medium just to see.<br />Same length<br /><br />Nice soft material tho"
3.0,Nice for my little girl. Fine and delicate
3.0,"Arrived with a blemish on the pendant that looked like a dab of adhesive (not able to remove). I was able to return the item without issue, but was not able to get it replaced before I needed it for a gift.  Disappointing."
3.0,"Decent match to my skin tone, a little too much pink base but it'll do. Also agree with another review saying if you wore them for awhile your ears do dry out weirdly so keeping them moisturized is a helpful note."
3.0,"Cute, but cheap materials and probably wont make it through many washes"
3.0,Product looks great and arrived as expected.  It is a much heavier material than I was anticipating.  Would probably be better used as a winter neck warmer than a breathable face covering.
3.0,The sleeves are too short and it had a hole in a seam that I will have to fix.  It is a little scratchy.  It doesn't seem to be of the same quality as the black and white one.
3.0,Cute shirt! I ordered a mediumbut does seem a little big.
3.0,"this items was beautifully designed, great bold colors, larger size. I loved it but the material is way too soft it does not hold it's shape well unfortunately."
3.0,It’s very cute top but very thin material
3.0,I bought this sweater to wear for our family Christmas photo.  The sweater lights up nicely even blinking and changing colors.  Don't expect it to last long as the weave is very cheap & I was already having spots loosening after a day of normal wear.  The size seems to be true to my normal size.
3.0,"Figured I would be able to keep some books, maybe my laptop in it. Definitely not. It’s so little I’d be surprised to fit a Poland spring water bottle"
3.0,Looks exactly like the picture.  If this is what you are looking to buy then you'll be happy with it.  No surprises here.
3.0,Cute outfit. Soft fabric. But the tag. Is in the outside of the outfit. Seen in picture.
3.0,The picture of the hat band makes it look like the conchos go completely around the band. What you see is all you get. I wonder if all their bands shown on that hat are the same way. I would not have bought it if I had known that. That is the problem buying things like this on Amazon. Things can be shown in such way that it impossible to tell exactly what you are getting. I think Amazon should have a policy that things be shown completely.
3.0,The wristband is ok. Where the band connects to the watch is metal and oversized. Band is also too long.
3.0,I really like this but the material is too thin to wear in public.... so I wear it to bed.  It's very comfortable.
3.0,"My boyfriend had this same hat a few years back- I saw it when it was really worn in and shaped. When it broke, I bought him a new one and, not surprisingly, it looked super dorky at first. Tents up in the front and very boxy. He pretty much lost all patience and doesn't wear it. Not necessarily the hat's fault, but the other creature hat I bought him (the &#34;creach-air&#34; cord hat) fit perfect on day 1. I'd go with that one."
3.0,Really pretty. It’s Just very fragile. If it were more durable it would be great.
3.0,"This top is pretty,  but run large in length."
3.0,Durable but faded after one wash and the red faded into the white
3.0,Much bigger  than I expected
3.0,"There are beautiful and was delivered the time I expected but, there are mildly not straight. May be because they doesn't came in a box, just in 2 small clear bags an the bubble envelope."
3.0,The sweater is decent quality - it's pretty thick/heavy but the size is extremely unaccurate. I ordered an XL for my nephew but it looks like a child's size.
3.0,I liked the color and the feel but it didn't fit how I thought it would it was more fitted than expected not as loosey as on the model...example the pocket was normal not loose. I usually wear a medium to large in tops ordered a large.
3.0,Not a bad shoe but not great for narrow feet with high arches.
3.0,Didn't hold everything in like I thought it would
3.0,Not meant for people with a chest.. it didn't even cover me fully. I was disappointed because it was so cute. I ended up giving to a friend.
3.0,"These did not work right out of the package. My engineer boyfriend had to fiddle around with the wires as well as buy new batteries to get them to work. Eventually they did, but buyer beware if you aren’t talented at making broken things work."
3.0,"Good if you wanna wear it for only a month , it tore twice on the back where the arms are but only needed it for one outfit so it’s good for a last minute purchase not for long term"
3.0,"Good shirt, button in back popped off at first use"
3.0,I am wearing it today for the first time.  It does help pull my shoulders back but it digs into my armpits.  I have had it on for 2 hours and I want to take it off but I'm going to hold out a little longer. I really want to like it.
3.0,"These work well and I like the pattern. My only dislike is the seam at the toes. For me, it causes a lot of discomfort as it wraps around both sides of my toes."
3.0,"First of all, it's important to say - I got exactly what I ordered. It was wrapped well, shipped quickly. (I live rurally) But, I am a paraplegic whose Doc advised compression socks.  These socks are definitely medical grade +. It took me, cornstarch, and my room mate nearly an hour to wrestle these on. I got Large size, and I weigh 110 pounds, so I am petite. Within a day, they hurt so badly, I had to cut them off.  If you are able bodied, and need very tight compression socks, in very pretty colors, these are great! I ended up buying three different Dr. Scholl's (very expensive) to get a good fit and tension.  The seller was wonderful and did their job, splendidly. It's the product I had a problem with."
3.0,"They look really pretty however, the prong that goes through your ear is so wide, it hurts too much to poke through to wear :-(<br />Sadly, I'm unable to wear them but they are very pretty."
3.0,Band is TIGHT<br />Order larger size for more comfortable fit
3.0,"For a woman or a child this would be great it is nice looking and seems well-made, but it is on the small size for a man's wrist"
3.0,Runs small . Need to Order 2 sizes Up.
3.0,I ordered a 3x but turned out to be way to big
3.0,"Buyer be ware. Item looks good, but it is too small for a grown man. This item is probably sized for a woman and/ or a man with very small wrist. Will offer it to my wife or my son. Disappointed&#60;"
3.0,Products is not like it seen in pictures. Mainly colour.
3.0,Returned didn’t like on me
3.0,Not what I expected. Returned.
3.0,I like this robe especially the color but I had to replace the zipper after one month.  It was a very cheap zipper and kept pulling apart.  I wouldn't recommend this product and wouldn't order from this company again.
3.0,The t-shirt was very pretty and made well.  It was a little too small for me as I am 59 years old and don't want things to fit too tight!  I bought it for a Kid's Health Fair with the theme of &#34;Superheroes&#34;.  I had decided to return it and the company went above and beyond to make me happy.  Great company!
3.0,"The material (titanium alloy) is great and doesn't make my super sensitive ears itch or irritated.  Sadly however, I ordered RAINBOW colored and the rainbow in only on one side of the hoop.  The other side is plain gold (which I don't like).  I have another pair of very similar hoops made by another company that have the rainbow color all over.  These were slightly less expensive - I'm still trying to decide if the $2 savings is worth it or not."
3.0,The watch band is gorgeous.  I must have mis-measured because it's a tiny bit too big.
3.0,These broke the first time I used them
3.0,"I wanted to like this shirt so much. I thought it was adorable, but maybe I stared in the mirror to long. There was just something about the cuffs that I did not love, so I ended up returning it.<br /><br />The shirt itself was super cute and looked just like the picture. I almost kept it actually, but I thought with myself doubting how much I liked it, I should just return it."
3.0,Limited applications.  Don't stay closed with smaller items bound in them.  There are better options.
3.0,One size up. Almost fits. 'Dad bod' the kids would call it. I've got a 43 chest and 33 waist. I order a large. I could've 'hulked out' in it.<br />Otherwise smooth and feels good. Feels a tad warm and heavy.
3.0,"Dress is on the thinner side, but would be perfect for summer with shape wear as it clings to hips and butt. Runs small size up 2 if your busty and one if you don’t want to keep your stomach sucked in all day. Would be perfect if it was more flowy."
3.0,"i wear a 32G and no way was this even close to being able to fit me. i ordered the largest possible, DD so i pretty much knew it wouldn't fit. only reason i gave 3 stars was not due to not fitting, that was my fault but the self adhesive didn't seem like it would last very long. it arrived on a hot day, so may that had something to do with it.."
3.0,"The earring come in a lot of pieces which is a little hard to manage since they're so small. The flower-like print is also longer on one side than the other but each earring has the same metal cut-out, so they're not a mirror image like pictured, but just the same piece. It's a small detail but one that hops on my nerves."
3.0,It fits okay but one sleeve is a bit different than the other. The solid line reaches the solid cuff on one side but not the other.
3.0,"Bought them for my husband as a gift. They fit well enough, but the light gray pants are NOT light nor gray. They are traditional camouflage if you ask me. I put them on to try them out before giving them to him and thought they were a little constricting, but he doesn't think so. He also does not try to do yoga in them or anything."
3.0,Not for plus size women and comes undone.
3.0,Runs small. I returned it
3.0,"I found that these jeans run slightly small, I'd recommend sizing up for a true fit. These are cute, they have a pretty good stretch to them. Trendy and fun for day to day wear. These have a very strong smell to them. Will require several washes to have the odor removed from the jeans."
3.0,"The bias on the front neckline of the dress came out on the first time I wore this dress. It is rayon and the binding is thin and not sewn well. luckily, I sew and can fix it myself."
3.0,Average dress and quality. As pictured.
3.0,I like the whole waist band. I thought everything was connected but it is all separate pieces. But it still gets the job done. The torso part is not as long as I thought either or I might just have a long one lol.
3.0,"I ordered two sizes down from size chart and it's not tight.  It fits fine but the size chart is wayyyyyyy off.  Cut shorter than I would prefer.  Colors darker than I would like but while I would not purchase again, I will wear them.  Probably good if you are short, I prefer longer length."
3.0,I had to wear the toe seam under my toes in order to be somewhat comfortable.
3.0,Very thin but it's what you would expect for the price.
3.0,"The dress just didn’t fit well all over.  The material was just a little off pockets felt like the were placed wrong, they felt like they were backward."
3.0,Cute but NOT soft fabric. Bottoms were a bit big but top fit just right.
3.0,I liked the ring but the palm side was too small.  Wrong size I ordered a size 7 not a size 10 .
3.0,"Didn't like the fit on me...not enough top for my top....if my boobs were a little smaller or the top portion was a little longer, i probably would have liked it."
3.0,"Love the way the band looks, wish I could have been able to adjust it a bit to fit tighter - but as it is it's ok.  Really makes the fitbit look like a piece of jewelry now. I'm not sure how long the clasp will last, just seems a bit flimsy to me. But love the look.<br />UPDATE: 2 months later - the finish is wearing off and there's copper color under the silver parts - the band came out of the side area, but just super glued it back in.  I would not recommend this for an active person, it's to floppy and can easily unlatch and fall off. I still like the look, but once it's totally broken I'll go to something more reliable."
3.0,Tabs break easily. Plastic cracks easily. Definitely a must have for backpacking though.
3.0,I love the erring but it's too difficult to go through the piercing in my ear. It's a little too big. However it's lovely
3.0,"Look beautiful in its etapa, but it  desataches easy from each peace since its a secuence of them. There is not sence for this. And, it is not suitable for kids its to loompy From The inside face."
3.0,Very see threw
3.0,"It's not very sparkly and the finish is dull.  It's okay for cheap costume, but for the price I should have returned it but misplaced the paperwork.  Oh well..."
3.0,I followed size chart.  An XL was way too small for me.  Too expensive to mail back to China.
3.0,I guess my shoulders are broad because it fit weird in the shoulders. It wasn't flattering either because it wasn't as flowy (more boxy) as the picture looked and I ordered a Medium when I'm usually in between a S/M.
3.0,"The one I received has grooves, but its still a decent ring mandrel. The sizing that i have verified appears to be correct."
3.0,"I ordered a pair that ran small, this was my fault. So I ordered the next size up, and when I tried my left foot, the 11 fit perfectly, I loved it, until I tried the right foot that was also an 11, and found that it was significantly larger, and a looser fit than the opposing shoe. It nearly falls off my foot when I walk, so now I have to return ANOTHER pair. I'm deciding if I want to spend my money elsewhere.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I do enjoy the slipper, it is most definitely comfortable, but I've never bought or ordered any shoe or slipper ever, and had them end up so different."
3.0,Seen better.
3.0,La blusita queda bien pero e<br />La part e inferior del traje de baño es algo grande para esa talla
3.0,"This dress is adorable. It's very cute and fits very well but it's has some issues. 1) It's sheer.  Very sheer. 2) There is no way on the planet you could ever wear a bra with the dress. The way the back and sides are cut would show any bra I've ever owned. I even tried putting a cardigan on over it and it still wouldn't cover it. So unless you have perky boobs that don't need a bra then this dress probably isn't for you. 3) Even if you have have gravity defying boobs, this dress has weird little pads that I assume are there to provide nipple coverage. They are weirdly shaped and I don't know how they are supposed to work.<br /><br />It's really a shame. This dress has such potential and yet it does some crazy things."
3.0,"Im usually a women's small or medium. For jackets and sweaters M can be safer when layering. (I'm a women's 6 or 8, 34D). I ordered the M and it's too snug. The arms go an inch or two above my wrists and the front hangs really open. The material is a little stiffer as well but I'm a soft freak."
3.0,They fit good. Laces are kinda cheap. They don’t have any pockets so you will have to get some to carry your wallet in.
3.0,"Item turned 1 week from receipt. Using hand cream and hand sanitizer could be to blame, but  it did not stay long for the item to look very cheap. This item is already discarded. Even though you get what you paid for, you should get some usage from it.  This one I did not."
3.0,They look a little cheap. I
3.0,"Comfortable with give, but definitely size up! I’m 5’8” and 118lbs and ordered a size 6 to give myself room. I typically wear a 4 and these are really snug on me. I could have even gone for an 8.<br /><br />Material is noisy as you walk or move- so be prepared for this as well.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these are the most flattering pants I own, but they are great for a relaxed weekend running around.  Color is fantastic and they are well made. The pair I received doesn’t have back pockets. I saw on another review that theirs did. 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />To me these are just ok"
3.0,"I was not too pleased with this color, it has too much yellow in it....it is an odd shade. I would not say it is &#34;Khaki&#34; color which would have a greenish tone to it. So it was not Khaki nor was it the color depicted in the photo which is what I call &#34;Beige.&#34; This cardigan has a strange mustard tone to it and it just doen't work with any of my other clothes. It fit fine. I wear a size 12 and the large size fit just fine. Oh well, it is the gamble one takes when shopping by mail. I gave it away to someone who looks much better in that color than I do."
3.0,It looked beautiful but it was made very cheap it was so very easily ripped. Like each seam was barley holding on. I threw it away after wearing it for about two hours it was totally ripped all over! My daughter is not hyper or careless she tried really hard to take care of it but it was just way too easy to rip. Don’t buy it if you want it to last longer than a one time deal.
3.0,No cuff link!
3.0,"Fit, style and color are as expected, but the sequins threaded through the weave were definitely NOT expected... I ended up spending several hours pulling them out as the outfit I wanted to wear this with was just not a ""sequin"" sort of outfit.<br /><br />The material was a little stiff initially but softened up after washing.  Overall good for the price, minus the unexpected sequins."
3.0,"I wish I read the reviews but I was impulsive when I got these. They’re cute but way too small for adults. They came looking how they were supposed to but in the photos they fail to show you that there’s an earring post that you put through a pierced ear. Anyway, it’s super cute but too small"
3.0,To big for ladies . But graphics good
3.0,The fabric is soft but very clingy.
3.0,Odd that the printing is on one side rather than the front. The front has a weird looking seam. The appearance is reminiscent of wearing pantyhose on your head. If you’re into that kind of thing.
3.0,"I wish I had gone up a size and bought the Large, to give more loose shape.  The color is a bright aqua, not the mint-ish shade pictured.  That, combined with the size being too tight, make this a non-starter in my Spring clothing lineup."
3.0,"The shoes looks very nice, elegant, yet still somewhat casual, so I'm super bummed that the sizing is totally off on the pair of shoes that were sent to me. I'm usually an 8.5, but have somewhat wide feet and bought a size 9 since it's summer and my feet tend to swell a little bit.<br />I can't even get into these shoes and they feel I'm trying to put on shoes that are at least 3 sizes smaller, really weird as the shoe says it's a size 9."
3.0,Not green more of amber yellow color. Besides the color being misrepresented I love the design.
3.0,The only problem with the nude is that the color does not match my skin tone cause I am brown but the socks are more white
3.0,I love the idea! The ease of use is so obvious the moment the strap is attached. Unfortunately this suffers from the quality of materials and the design. The strap looses its grip randomly rendering its primary purpose useless.
3.0,Bit tight and uncomfortable
3.0,"I ordered an XL.  The dress fits a little bigger than what I expected.  Even though this dress comes in sizes S - XXL, it's more suited for those with a smaller frame.  Also, the dress is long.  I am 5'6 and my dress comes right to the top of my feet.  The back is a little low so if you want to wear a bra, it will be able to be seen."
3.0,"The wings are really awesome, but the dress fits oddly.  The waist is perfect, but the bust is way big.  I'm a reasonably proportional (from a fashion design perspective), so it's a really strange fit.  I'm either gonna figure out a way to alter it, or just remove the wings and attach them to a different dress if the first option proves too difficult."
3.0,"Cute top. Thought the stripes were black, but they are blue. Had to keep pulling the top down for it to stay off my shoulders."
3.0,"I think this sweater is cute but it’s a little thin and a TEENY bit see through. It’s also runs a bit large and low in the chest. Because it’s a little big it runs long. I’m 5’3 maybe 115lbs and I have a short torso. When I have this tied I feel like I’m walking with a tail between my legs! But other than that, it’s really cute, just a tad big but that’s cute for that slouchy fall look. I almost returned it, especially because the ties are so long, but friends convinced me to keep it since it looks so cute! Nice soft material. Probably wouldn’t buy it again but I like it enough and the color was as expected."
3.0,This hat is very pretty. The color is exactly like the picture but the hat is not as big as it looks on the picture! It comes all flat and u have to work with it to make it look like the picture. After I worked with it for a couple of days t turned out to be a nice hat!
3.0,"For me?  Huge design flaw.  Okay, for the price, I'll live. But I thought the whole point of scratch-resistant glasses was to have a clear field of vision.  on the gold ones, the bar that connects the lenses IT'S IN BOTH EYES FIELD OF VISION!  It might not annoy you, and okay, I'll live, but wow, HOW would somebody design this?"
3.0,Can't see my phone with these on...
3.0,The coat wasn’t as heavy as I thought it would’ve been
3.0,Very cute but the plastic snaps are bad quality and closure on the bottom isn't snug. I put booties over the feet to make it more snug.
3.0,Didn’t stretch. Return
3.0,"My purse is beautiful and the strap is very comfortable which is what I was looking forward to.  Until today, nine months later, I have been very happy with the design and quality of the purse; however, today I discovered that one of the seams on the interior lining had come apart leaving a hole.  I was really hoping this bag would last a year or two."
3.0,Good quality just smaller then expected
3.0,"I loved it, but it was a thank you gift for someone overseas. Unfortunately I will not be able to get feed back from the person."
3.0,I’m short 5’1.. this fits just below the knee. The chest stretches but retains its color. Good and cute for summer
3.0,Wish size matched their dropdown better.
3.0,"The size is 31, and fits smaller."
3.0,Looks great but sizing runs very small
3.0,"I know it was only $10, but it came with one of the Velcro panels already detached, and after four days another came off. I’ve left both stuck so I can find the right glue to put them back on. So for $10 plus the price of glue, it’s cute. I just didn’t want to have to fix it the first week I’ve worn it."
3.0,"Very pretty, unfortunately they break easily.  I missed the return window so I'm stuck with them."
3.0,Little small. I’m 5’11 145 lbs. male
3.0,Loved the shoes but size too small for 9. Three of us tried them on and they didn't fit any of us that are 9.
3.0,"Vest was delivered as expected and fit as expected. Only issue that makes me inclined to return the product is the snap buttons. According to the product images, on the black vest, the snap buttons are black. But, what I got, the snaps are silver, which cheapens the look."
3.0,"This is a Christmas gift, therefore, I can only give my own opinion, it is a very nice card sleeve and I like it, however, will have to update this after Christmas when the gift is given. Reason for only 3 stars at this time."
3.0,Estan  muy bonita
3.0,Cute I expected them to be a bit more strong but they are good so far!
3.0,DISAPPOINTED! I specifically order these because of the knocker. Received in the mail had no knocker on them just the jewel contacted seller assured me they would replace them for free here it is several months later and still don't have my replacement for what I wanted. The jewel tends to have a very faded color and sharp edges.
3.0,They are bit heavy. Look real cool though
3.0,"Yes, it's Sterling silver, yes it has a nice clasp. No I was not prepared for how small 1mm actually is. Probably would not order again."
3.0,Wish the octopus was larger please include size of pendent.<br />Other then that is is nice.
3.0,"The gold rubbed off, I've had it for a few months now and its completely silver now. But its still cute though."
3.0,"Bought as a Christmas gift super cute, came as expected"
3.0,I love that it has pockets but it does wrinkle easily
3.0,Returned product. Not a great fit.
3.0,"I wear this waist trainer at night usually and it digs into my sides and leaves very painful imprints. I'll admit it does make my stomach flatter, but it is not very comfortable and I don't recommend working out in it either."
3.0,Waist was fine but legs are short and fit too small. Loved the look and material but was uncomfortable being too tight
3.0,While the top and everything fit nice it was wayyyy to long. I'm 5'9 and it was at an awkward length even with wedges. If I was living on a compound it would be a bit more fitting.
3.0,The shirt is true to size and feels like decent quality fabric. The screen printing was flawed with a thin streak that was not printed near the bottom of the image. My husband still likes it and will wear it but it would be nice if the image was completely clear.
3.0,They keep my kids hands warm and fairly dry from the snow.
3.0,These are more like tights than socks because of the fabric but they will work for what I needed them for.
3.0,Love it but not true to size.
3.0,Good for the price. Used it for a costume. It is not a very good fabric.
3.0,2 xl fit 38 D - Way to big for my cup size.  I did't really like these sports bras.  They don't fit my body well and they are pretty stiff.  I thought I would take a chance.  Hard to get on and off over your head.  Disappointed in general.  But - I am a difficult fit so maybe that is what went wrong.
3.0,"Very nice looking shirt and arrived quickly, however for a medium it was HUGE. Perhaps it would be an ok fit for someone who liked to wear their clothes a little bigger but this was purchased for a man who is fairly slender and tall (who typically wears medium size) This looked way too huge and unflattering at the medium size. I suggest anyone similarly built who does not want the shirt to be too big of a fit to order a size down."
3.0,"Nice hat. Son wanted to match new jacket. Planned to wear for his birthday but the hat was very late. 4 days later than promised. I knew using USPS was a risk. Vendor should consider new shipping method, particularly when charging for shipping. Good product poor service."
3.0,Will have tobretu4n fir larger size
3.0,Exactly as I expected and is perfect for layering a professional look
3.0,"The mask is cute but, the black lines remind me of just drawn on sharpie. The flowers are secure and other than the lines is made super well."
3.0,"The leggings are great for working out or just hanging out. However, the pockets are very small and can really only fit a small iphone with no case."
3.0,They are okay for their price but fall apart fairly easily and not as tight as expected. I gave it 3 stars because I got 3 for $20 so the above complaints were to be expected.
3.0,VERY slim fitting.
3.0,They are the perfect light weight flannel that I was looking for.  I'm usually a medium borderline large.  From the reviews I decided to order the large.  Unfortunately they are tight in the shoulders and the sleeve length is a tad short.  Bummer its hard to find light weight flannel. Will probably end up returning because if they shrink I'll be mad that I kept them.
3.0,The material felt good quality but the sizes are confusing. The one I ordered was way too tight. I also ordered it in white and it had a mark on the front
3.0,"Fit great on top, but if you're a curvy girl it's not for you. Very slim through the hip area. You must be super thin for it to look flowy like it does on the model.  Great for a girl with no hips."
3.0,Fits smaller than normal. Says squat proof they’re not.
3.0,"It came on time it looks nice the material was okay but ran a little big, it's okay"
3.0,Some looked nice and the others were of poor quality
3.0,It's like being wrapped in a teddy bear. I like the color. It's as pictured. The neckline and zipper that ran up to it were a little annoying. It kept poking me. Haven't washed it yet so not sure how well it'll come through. Will update once it's washed.
3.0,"I wanted a medium thickness white quarter zip and thought this would be just right. Indeed, the fit is as expected. I am 5'1"" and 150 lbs. I ordered a large because I like room to layer. This is perfect for that and thank goodness! This is very thin. You can see my pink shirt through the thin white. Perhaps if the sweatshirt were a different, darker color, this would not be the case.<br /><br />I have decided to keep it because, as I said, I like to layer and this is large enough to do that. However, if you are looking for an autumn/winter, thick sweatshirt, you should probably try something else."
3.0,If fits very close to the head. it's no thick so I don't think it will be very warm.
3.0,Great customer service .. it was somewhat large
3.0,"Frames are not silver as they appear in the photo, they are gold"
3.0,"It’s overall okay. Good price, but material is an itchy polyester. I’m 5’7, 140 lbs, 36B and ordered a medium. A bit tight on top and wide on bottom."
3.0,Too long and I'm 6ft tall. The mock turtle neck is the same weave as the rest of the shirt. It should be knitted into the rest of it. It's a seperate piece sewn on. Looks like a women's top because of it. I'll still wear it under a jacket but I am dissapointed.
3.0,"Decent work shoes.<br /><br />They are very poorly made, I wouldn't repurchase. If you walk to and fro' a lot the shoes will definitely fall apart rather quickly."
3.0,Cheap clasps.  Might get a few wears out of each one without having to repair.  Overall not bad for the price.
3.0,The photo is definitely deceiving on how classy this skirt is. It has a dark chocolate brown inner lining so I bought the gray skirt to avoid the clash of red/brown and black/brown. It's a cheaper material and shiny as well. The fit is totally fine and feels really comfortable. It's just not nearly as classy as it seems...
3.0,Cute for the price. A little thin.
3.0,I loved the material.... but it was HUGE...I’m 5’4 around 180 with a large chest and I was literally hanging off of me... Sending the Large back for a Medium.
3.0,Very baggy and the fabric was odd. It didn’t flow nicely. There was a lot of it. I guess you could order a size down. I’m 5’0 and I was swimming in it. Again the fabric had a stiff feel. Otherwise it was very pretty!
3.0,"a little pricey, the fabric was not quite what i was expecting but it was nice. though being 6'4&#34; 180 i have a hard time finding shirts that fit right. and in medium its still a bit fat in the middle, leaves it the shirt flapping in the back or on the sides."
3.0,"returned, sizes off."
3.0,I had orange shoes that were became almost a salmon color. Very good product when it comes to getting shoes clean though.
3.0,Not what i expected. a bit disappointed
3.0,"I liked this watch but you cannot resize it at any store due to the wood being so delicate. So it has sat in the box because it is too large. I wish I would have known that, it is not easy to remove links."
3.0,I don't like the fact that they change the colors on the screen. I'm not sure if these are causing me headaches. I wish the lens were clear
3.0,"Seems to be good quality - just feel the stones should be a little smaller.  Not &#34;gaudy&#34; looking, but any bigger and it would be."
3.0,Very dark. Only able to use them on very bright days.
3.0,"Works great for Flag Football for my son, although seem a little narrow, but my son has big feet so it could just be him."
3.0,"Not up to date<br />On page 53 a ref is made to DA Pam 670-1 dated 25 May 2017, when the latest is dated 2021<br />No mention of Branch sleeve stripes on blues dress coat"
3.0,"It's youth size. It should be more clear in the description. ""One size fits most"" is not true. The max adjustment is probably adult size 6 or so. It's comfortable on my 6 year old with about an extra inch."
3.0,"As promised, but a little too stiff for my liking."
3.0,this wrap is too short for my arms unfortunately.
3.0,"The image online makes the shirt appear to be form-fitting, made of a softer cotton. But when received it is very square and stiff. Also a strong odor, not sure if it's the ink?"
3.0,Illfitting
3.0,Snow sticks to the sole.
3.0,The neckline is not cut to be off shoulder which after talking to others who also purchased seems to be a hit or miss thing . It wasn't as flowy on me just kind of blah but I will make it work
3.0,Good looking socks but I find them to be pretty small in size.
3.0,I love this swimsuit but size runs SMALL! The XL would fit size 10/12 in woman size. Otherwise super cute!
3.0,Very nice but not the size of my wrist!
3.0,the top is way too big and falls off
3.0,"Two pieces sewn together into one bigger piece, it's OK product, but I didn't find it to be very effective"
3.0,I'm returning this watch because the light doesn't work.  I'm not re-ordering in case the product in general is faulty.
3.0,"Looks nice, and I like the wire screw on holder (not sure it if will come unscrewed  by itself or not with use), but to read anything more on the tag than one line, you have to unscrew it, remove the wire, and pull the card out of the silicone sleeve.  Great for privacy, and ""maybe"" an airline rep would actually bother going through those steps, but I am not sure they would, or that you'd then get the tag back.  It's a bit odd."
3.0,A little snug for an x-large and much thinner than one would expect for a sweater.
3.0,Cuts your butt in half...
3.0,The price should have been more of an indication but these feel real cheap when you are holding them... Oh well. Was a gift for my Mom and she seemed to really love them. Got each of her kids birthstones to go on a necklace.
3.0,Its sure holds alot.. Material is soft but doesnt have any support to hold it up.
3.0,"While it was great to have a nice variety of colors, the elastic stretched out (& ""puckered"") after only a couple wearings."
3.0,So how it has some sort of patches and it has a small hole in it
3.0,"Very thin material, need to wear a slip. I bought two 3-packs, the 1st ran large. The 2nd ran small. Still, a decent value."
3.0,Seems to made very well and looks high quality but it’s too small to fit my ear. Also disappointed that it only works on the left side - I would’ve preferred it on my right.
3.0,they screwed the ball on way too tight which when twisted caused the bats to just break off from the rest of the jewelry i’m so disappointed because i was so excited for this one and couldnt wait to wear it.. I wouldn’t buy if you want something to last bc this broke before i even got to wear it :(
3.0,"I have a case similar to the way this is styled, however, these jewels go missing 100x faster than my case. I was disappointed."
3.0,It looked like  PJ top. It will do for the office.
3.0,Rides up a lot if wearing during a workout. It's fine for just walking.
3.0,Acceptable quality for $20. Hinges are not smooth and pins are week locking. Does give an expansive look to your Charge 2.
3.0,Cheap sunglasses. they are worth 10 bucks
3.0,"They are really cute, but they are MUCH bigger than they appear in the picture."
3.0,Fits as expected.... Material isn't the best ..but an  ok dress for the price
3.0,"Could have been prepared and packaged better. Overall, satisfied. I'd recommend if you're after the piercing jewelry. Has a nice selection for sure, just not a quality selection."
3.0,Looks like it's a homemade dress. There's no tags on it at all. It's not something I would buy again.
3.0,"The goggles do not provide any anti fogging. After reaching customer service they didn’t care less about fixing the issue. Won't recommend.<br />Updated: Customer service did send me a replacement afterward and I am updating my review to 3 stars, nevertheless the goggles get fogged after a few minutes of use."
3.0,Absolutely beautiful! The blue gems are a bit darker than what I expected but that's ok.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of how long it took to get here and that Amazon still says it's on its way... but the rings were worth the wait absolutely stunning '<br /><br />*update*<br />The rings start to change color and tarnish rather quickly.. Mine lost the black color after first month now are turning a copper color
3.0,Perhaps it’s too long or i just have a shorter torso but it either comes up right under my boobs and squished them up a little or right over by Butt making it negatively shelf like. Still good for the purpose but don’t wear it out often unless it’s under hoodie or something loose fitting
3.0,"It's alright. The buttons are very cheapy - though it does come with a replacement. I unfortunately haven't found the opportunity to wear this yet, it doesn't feel the best, but it's alright for the price."
3.0,Cute but a couple of charms popped off
3.0,I mean it’s PJs. Runs big. Elastic on shorts are all twisted. Cheap Made
3.0,The quality of this shawl is nice however it. Is not as large as the photo shows.The point of the triangle does not come down that far in the back.
3.0,"A little stiff to start with, but it starts to break in.  I had to replace one of the pins as it broke a few weeks after use."
3.0,Beautiful shoe and color but had to return due to being too small 😑 do order a size up and you won't be disappointed.
3.0,Mostly good. See through when stretched. I’m keeping them but disappointed with the low quality.
3.0,"The color on these are great, it’s a muted mauve. I ordered the size medium, I’m about 150 lbs. The problem I had with these was the awkward cut in the back (the stitching starts way below where my actual butt begins lol) so it makes it look like I have a flat ass🤣. It could also be from the fact that the waistband is too wide for the size of the legs. The leg portion fits snugly but the waist is too loose and emphasises parts of my body I do not want enphasized. That being said, they are comfortable and made of good material, just fit awkwardly."
3.0,Not as cool as I thought it was going to be. Okay though. Wouldnt buy again.
3.0,Very cute but too fitted. Gave it away.
3.0,I must say it is a Big 44mm watch. The dial is beautiful and glows bright and last fully charged for 2 hours. Crown is big easy to set time and date. Three time zones is awesome and easy to do. Band was the only disappointed cheap material and to short for my wrist. It sucks because the buckle has RECON brand on it which is cool. Swimming is good I am taking it diving 50 ft. Will let you know how it goes. Happy with purchase the case is bulletproof and real Safire crystal.
3.0,"I would size up, had to return"
3.0,"Fits large. The fabric is really nice! It's high quality and soft. I got white, and it is a little see-through. It's a high quality dress, but it doesn't fit me very well. The neckline is also higher than I thought it would be."
3.0,Ordered a 4x but fits like a 2x
3.0,"Fits, but not made for covid. This is for middle eastern religious use"
3.0,"I have to have the metal in the top of the mask so it stays on my nose and does not slip off.  For me, I cannot wear them because I am in school working with students.  I had to keep pulling it up.<br />But I ordered because I loved the lips showing so the kids could see my mouth move !"
3.0,"These are so cute but I’m kind of upset with these, the first time i tried a pair on the fishnet ripped so that was something. then later on while wearing one of the bows fell off, then later on the other bow fell off. So basically this happened with all the colors. I’m guessing they all fall off because they’re just glued onto the fishnet socks. I just fixed them by just sowing the bows back on, it was simple enough but i was upset that the bows fell off every color did for me and usually in the first wear of wearing them."
3.0,I got a large but find it very tight and clingy. Great value though.
3.0,"I wanted to wear to wedding, but way too small, ordered 8, wear 6 and felt like I was putting on children’s dress.  It was just that small.🥲<br />Color and design are gorgeous!"
3.0,Shirt and sleeves both too long
3.0,Pensé que eran más grandes los aretes..
3.0,These are not at all stretchy! They look ok tho.
3.0,"Not all that well made, but they work fine for some cute novelty sunglasses. Comes with a nice quality carrying pouch. If these break, I'll keep the pouch for my old trusty sunglasses.<br /><br />Cute item, but not amazing quality."
3.0,I’m slightly disappointed in the pjs. The top isn’t white like the pants; but a cream color. I wouldn’t have purchased the product if I had known the color different. It isn’t as pictured.
3.0,Love the dress; a little shorter than I expected; very comfortable and casual.
3.0,it's ok for the money I spent on it
3.0,Size is weird and it silky not what I expected
3.0,These run larger than I expected. I have a larger wrist but should have ordered the small
3.0,"Very cute, but also a bit heavy. After 4 hours my ears were sore."
3.0,Please check the attached pictures of the salwar (pant) as to how it tore just after wearing it once and that too for 2 hours.<br />Looks like it was made from the cheapest quality of fabric that it didn’t last even for a day.<br />The kameez (top) is good but given the condition not sure how long will that last .Didn't expect such a thing from a product on Amazon.<br />Let me know what can be done in this.
3.0,"Attractive, beautiful cap but the SIZE IS WAY TOO SMALL TO FIT traditionally. Ordering a larger size than usual would be a good idea."
3.0,There really isn't much compression.
3.0,"Item just received today. Right out of the package, one earring is already broken. The other is fine. Magnets seem strong enough to hold and the one that isn’t broken is comfortable and stays in place well."
3.0,"Was really looking forward to the headband with the flowers, got just a bow, instead. Cute outfit."
3.0,"Styling is cute but they were much to big for my face. They fit over the ear, but the proportions were larger than I like. More BUG like."
3.0,"Son was not happy with the fit, knee pads are very small. He wanted them because of the name brand however the UA brand fit so much better."
3.0,This runs a bit large. I am 120 lbs and got a small. I’m 5’4” and the dress comes to the knee. I prefer an inch or two above. I probably could have gotten an extra small. Hope this helps for people to gauge the size. I tried the dryer in hopes to shrink it a little but it didn’t shrink.
3.0,These luggage tags have nice designs on them but the artificial leather has a horrible odor (or perhaps its the dye that is sued).
3.0,"The color of the print ruined the whole white shirt, before I could even wear it."
3.0,"They are nice glasses, and the quality of the lenses were great, but I probably wore them 3 times,and about 2&#34; of the earpiece broke off...<br />The material was like a softer plastic, So I guess the quality of the frames are not what they could be."
3.0,Took me 20 minutes to get into my piercing. Had to stretch to open it and it won't close over the top of my ear. Very small.
3.0,"Beautiful material, but design looked very outdated. Returned."
3.0,"nice enough. adjustable.<br />Pearls are too big for my liking, though."
3.0,"Kind of small , fit but thought it was bigger"
3.0,"Great fabric, thick and textured, not your usual thin swimsuit material. Unfortunately even the XL was not long enough for me so had to return."
3.0,It's an okay set but the bracelet isn't wearable.  I can't get it to fit well.<br />I would not recommend compared to other jewelry on Amazon
3.0,As the price says so is the quality
3.0,"It's cheap looking but nice. I wish it was heavier and thicker, all metal would be better."
3.0,It doesn't  look like the picture. Out of shape.
3.0,Good price but flimsy
3.0,"Cute shirt, but extremely short. More like a crop shirt."
3.0,"I love the way the ear cuff looks.  It is very pretty, but it is impossible to put on by yourself.  The balls are so small that you cannot hold it to screw it into the back.  I ended up using an earring with a long enough shaft to put a regular earring back on it.  Maybe if you had someone there to help you put it on the whole ear cuff might work."
3.0,The package was delieverd late but it fit as expected.
3.0,It’s cute but not what I expected. I guess the picture to me looks like it would be fitted all the way to the lower abdomen and then flare out but instead it stops at the top of my ribs and flares so it doesn’t give me the best silhouette. It has pockets which is always great but I put my phone in it and you could tell the dress’s stretch like material was getting pulled. So only light weight things for these pockets they are decently deep though. It’s lightweight I haven’t worn it out yet it just came in today but it doesn’t seem like it will be suffocating in the heat. I’m 5’7 and 135 and I ordered the Medium. I debated sending this back to get a small but I don’t think it’s the size that’s off just the cut of the flare. Still cute though.
3.0,"When the jacket arrived I was very pleased.  It was of a thick well made stretchy material.  I ordered according to the instructions being very careful since so many things are made with Asian sizing.  It is very difficult to find professional clothing.  Imagine my disappointment when I went to put it on and it was too small.  I had to return it. For help, I am 42&#34; bust, 35 waist, 42 hips.  And I ordered an XL.  I would have needed a 3XL for a proper fit..<br /><br />I would have kept it if it had fit."
3.0,It’s okay but the material is cheap. Hope at least it stand for the third wash.
3.0,"Cute suit. Fit a little large on me. I chose the XXXL (sz 12-14 per mfr) because I'm a smallish size 12 and reviewers said the suits run small. I'm 5'7&#34;, 167lbs., a little short-waisted with slightly broad shoulders, 38D, 32&#34; inseam.  While there is plenty of adjustment room on the sliding adjustments on all straps on the bikini top, I still could not get it quite right around the under-bust area. The top kept sliding up.  If I was 10-15 lbs heavier it would probably fit better. I've got an ample backside but the bottoms fit slightly too large.  It's decently constructed for the price and a very cute style. Wish it fit better. I have returned it."
3.0,"It's a simple black dress, which is exactly what I was looking for. The material is a bit thinner that I wished for."
3.0,"Super cute, but band scratches wrist."
3.0,"This could have easily been a five, except the damn dress is not centered, you can still wear it but know you will spend time checking yourself to see if your alignment is off lol"
3.0,The length is rather long and not was what I was looking for. I returned it.
3.0,Seemed like a nicely made shoe but too narrow for my feet.
3.0,Runs large but doubt sizing down would work since it's too wide not too long.... I don't like the elastic around neck but the fabric is really nice.
3.0,"Dress material was heavier than I thought. Returning dress. For someone else, the dress may be perfect."
3.0,They do not stretch vary hard to get on and tight and I orderd one up from my size and the cow prints cut off on the sides but if you put in the washer they get a little big and as you were them the black dots disappear
3.0,"A lot of variety but I didn't have a need for most of the jewelry, Still worth buying, Instead of paying the same price for just 3 pieces of jewelry."
3.0,"The fabric was extremely cheap and rather thin. I thought it would be more of a cotton/linen material, but it was actually a stretchy spandex blend."
3.0,"The purse fits my S5 in it's case, which is perfect... However, the attachment for the wrist strap is cheaply made and defective.  The purse was constantly falling off the wrist strap and therefore unusable as a &#34;hands-free&#34; purse.  Now it's just another &#34;wallet&#34; I have to shove into a bigger purse.  Which totally defeats the purpose."
3.0,Again on the small side quality is fine they justCan't get the sizing right
3.0,These are for a 5th grader
3.0,The product was Alright the color didn’t look good on me.
3.0,NOT MOTORCYCLE JACKET
3.0,"it is so small more than I expect, but if you want a small purse just for your phone and keys and maybe one lipstick! it would be perfect for you. I don't feel like I am wearing bag, so comfortable."
3.0,"I do have ankles on the larger side, but have never had a problem finding socks that fit. These are extremely small at the opening with little to no stretch."
3.0,"It's great for bathing , but  hair sticks to it"
3.0,To small for size
3.0,"Love the color and material, size not so much. Feels like a 1X and not a 3X."
3.0,"Overall, this wasn't a bad pair of pants, but * feel that the material could have been a bit thicker and higher quality. As for the length, After I trimmed about 4 inches from each leg, the pants length was perfect for me- right around at the ankle.<br />Sizing seems to be on-point."
3.0,"It is very light/plastic material, but is fine for carrying my work ID and phone."
3.0,"Pros:<br />Nice summer weight,<br />room where you need it.<br />quality stitching<br />Cons:<br />Thigh pocket is good, if you need to carry a tactical iPad maybe.<br />No good clip spot for a clip pocket knife.<br />Drawstring on a flap-over velcro secured pocket? why?<br />Waist adjustment clasp on right side faces the wrong way. When you thread your belt through, it tends to grab the clasp/open it.<br />Still trying to figure out why I need a drawstring waist - I'm probably don't have enough tacticool creds to appreciate it."
3.0,"The color is vivid just as showed in the picture, but the size runs huge. I have to keep it for 2 years before my daughter can fit into it."
3.0,Flimsy. Tips fell off quickly and product began coming apart.
3.0,Harder to breathe through this mask.
3.0,"Material is good, but it couldn’t handle a single wash..."
3.0,"This shirt is actually really well made. The material is sewn well and the fabric feels great. I normally wear a 2x and order a size bigger, but considering the biggest they had was 2x I relentlessly ordered a 2x. I can't say I was as disappointed as I thought I would be. The shirt initially fit, it fit a little bit small but it was still wearable. After being washed and dried It shrunk and doesn't fit any longer. The lettering looks nice but my concern would be how long it would last up in the wash.<br /><br />I really like this shirt, I just wish they had bigger sizes.<br /><br />&#34; I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. &#34;"
3.0,"They're just OK for costume Jewelry, we've definitely had better quality earrings in this style before. My wife sort of likes one of them, but mostly says she wouldn't buy it just for that and actually doesn't particularly like any of them. They might be more of someone else's style, but we are strongly unimpressed with the set."
3.0,"Pretty, but make my feet sweat a bit. Wouldn't necessarily buy again."
3.0,Aside from being too pink to see the font it’s a very comfy and flattering shirt.
3.0,"I am 5'2 and 130lbs and the Small was too big for me (length and width).  I had to return, but otherwise it did look like a well made skirt and was pretty."
3.0,"nice color,great compliments"
3.0,"This is a pretty decent watch. One of the downsides to it is the winding. For some reason the gears in the back won't grip each other properly, so I have to open it up and actually hold them down while I wind the watch (might just be a faulty one). Another downside would be that it never came with the cleaning cloth that was advertised and the hands are different than pictured. However, the watch does keep great time and a full wind will keep it ticking for more than 24 hours. It also looks great and is easy to read.<br /><br />Pros: -keeps time  Cons: -lack of items advertised<br />  -looks great  -difficult winding<br />  -easy to read"
3.0,"Not very flattering, dull color."
3.0,"The color is more of a washed out Army Green, not like the photo.  The quality of the dress is not the best.  One of the pockets wasn't sewn.  The dress is comfortable.  I would not recommend it to my friends."
3.0,"These aren't sweatpants as it says in the description that's the main reason I took the chance and bought 2 they are thinner than sweats. Very long for me in the crouch region ankles are a bit snug. The waist fits perfect. I'm 5"" 110lbs wouldn't recommend if your looking for actual sweat pants. They do seem to be comfortable even though have to fold it over so they don't sage in the crouch region."
3.0,I should have order my correct size as they will stretch a little after wearing.
3.0,Quality great but spects. not good. OTC over the knee. Not recommended
3.0,"Couldnt adjust this to get a good fit for me, i have large wrists. Also after only a week of use it broke :/"
3.0,Not as roomy as I thought. Seems the wheels and structure take up more room than necessary.
3.0,"Painful to wear and too big for my nose. Some came broken. As a nose ring, they do not fit, as a septum they are a little wide but are acceptable. Fine on the ears as long as they are not at an angle to pinch."
3.0,I ordered this for a gift. The material was very soft. It looked just like the photo. My only complaint is that I ordered a medium and was sent an extra large. I assume the sizing is off because the extra large was not that big.
3.0,Works fine. Stretched and twisted within 6months.
3.0,Thin and run a little small
3.0,Scratched easily
3.0,It's cute but the size runs smaller than others
3.0,Decent dress for the price
3.0,"Cute dress, comfy material. Unfortunately it made me look a little boxy, so I passed it along to a taller friend of mine (I’m 5’4”). Seems like a natural risk when buying maxi dresses online and being this height, so it didn’t make me feel negatively. I didn’t bother exchanging the item because I think the medium weight of the material is what caused the boxy look, but it looks excellent on her!"
3.0,Purchase your exact size
3.0,This product ran on the small side
3.0,Doesn't have strong hold
3.0,Not for the larger breathed girls. Under a tank top it's OK however not a stand alone bra.
3.0,I wear a size 7-9 in womens pants and these were VERY tight around my thigh.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous and classy! The beading that patterns the design was unexpected and beautiful. I ordered it in size 14P and it was perfect for my 5’2 and 156 lbs frame. I really, really wanted to keep it but the beading was rough and was constantly rubbing under my upper arms. It was a deal breaker and I had to return it😟"
3.0,My mother seems to like them.  I found them a little cheap but for the price I can't complain.
3.0,I like it for fun.
3.0,They were not as flat as the picture implied but they worked no one even noticed that I had them in. Only problem I had is I lost one of the top ball things within a week.
3.0,Too small. Cheaply made but I bought them for Vegas in case they got ruined so nothing lost for the price
3.0,"I'm kind of disappointed, it's a cute hoodie but the sizes run kind of small if you a bit bigger than the average girl or if you have thick arms. I got a large and it was way too small, when I would lift my arms up it showed my bra! I don't recommend this too thick thick women"
3.0,Plastic piece by nose snapped on one of them. The other one the part near the clasp fell off too.
3.0,Had to send it back it was too feminine
3.0,The shoe is big and has no arch support.  Not happy with color.  Will save for summer and wear with shorts.
3.0,Looked more like skinny shorts than just shorts.
3.0,Wife likes them and they fit well even in an extra small.
3.0,"It decorates your body in a very sexy way,but the material is kind of fake. Is ok, it is fun to wear."
3.0,It's a little on the small size.  I would order up one size.
3.0,"The dress is made well, I have ordered from this seller before.  Sadly, it did not fit me well.  I am 5'1&#34; and 115pounds, curvy.  I ordered a SMALL and it did not fit me as a body-con dress, it was a little loose in the mid-section."
3.0,I ordered up multiple sizes for my 4 year old and it fits like a tunic to wear with leggings. It’s far too short to be a dress. This tunic runs small. I would definitely order up a size or 2.
3.0,Really oversized! Not sure I’ll be able to wear them
3.0,"Collects first, awkward feel.... don't like it for what I paid........."
3.0,The blue hue for a shirou shirt is way to saturated for cosplay as it's like a blueberry blue. Comfy shirt tho
3.0,"Air movement is very minimal, but it definitely is neat; I was using it with a spray bottle which helped out the cooling effect.  I ended up breaking it apart, and installing it in a more shade friendly bowl style hat."
3.0,"I like these socks, and they give me a chance to be a little rebellious in a boring office environment.  One of the pairs already had holes in them, and another pair was so small that they were difficult to put on.  I suppose next time, I will purchase the next larger size and deal with them falling around my ankles; better that than having my feet turn purple. I also wish they were longer.  It's not good showing off your legs because your socks are too short."
3.0,"nothing like I expected. You may love it, but I didn't."
3.0,"wish it was better 😣 my daughter would be 6 months next month, and i read past reviews how large the outfit was for a 6-9 month baby. so i decided to buy 3-6 month outfit. when i tried it on, the onesie fit her good, however... the other part of the outfit was way too big!!!! and the ""bow"" you have to build it on her head. (a piece of cloth is provided) so if you suck at doing bows (like me) , you won't be able to use it!! but it's alright, the outfit is cute once fixed, and you can always fix it by sewing. always look in the positive, she will definitely wear for her photoshoot.. so thank you."
3.0,"Too big, so sent it back"
3.0,"It was a super cute skirt and overall it seemed well made, but it was waaaaaaay too small.  I had to return it.  It came from a Chinese company as all it's tags were written in it.  If you're super skinny and a size 0-5, I would say: &#34;Get it!&#34;  It would probably fit you nicely!"
3.0,It’s great! Easy to use the bottom grill looks great but the top looks really wired but remember is is like $14 bucks so you should let expect perfection.
3.0,Not at all like the color of the picture.  I was hoping for something more gray. The item I received was more red.
3.0,I keep loosing the back piece.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:185cac7eb3993882e7f71a927627a1cb]] This is a good skirt, BUT it's very difficult to put the strings on, and another thing is that the zipper isn't good quality at all, Everytime I zip it up it doesn't work- Basically the zipper will go up but won't close/zip correctly."
3.0,Well made but onev to two sizes too small.
3.0,Don't get me wrong I absolutely love this necklace. I got lots of compliments on it. But when I took it out of the baggie it came in I noticed that a few smaller butterflies 🦋 had fallen off and were lose inside of it.<br /><br />I circle it in red so you can see it. It wasn't really noticeable so I wore it anyway. But I would have at least liked to get a good 24 hours out of it before it started breaking down on me.<br /><br />The necklaces is a set of 2.
3.0,"These gloves are quite simply okay. I wish I had gone with another brand, though.<br /><br />They're soft and on the smaller side. The touch pad part does work....on the event that I can actually get it lined up with my fingers.<br /><br /> I measured my hands in comparison to the insert and by the guidelines given. However, the touch pad rarely lines up with my fingers and often bunch up at the end. This makes using the phone difficult. I saw they offer full refunds but I did not contact seller about replacements or returns due to the fact that it's now 0F and my other pair of gloves has ripped. They're better than nothing but I'm still planning on looking elsewhere in the future.<br /><br />They are very soft and warm, though not waterproof and not suitable for prolonged exposure. Regardless, they're still pretty good for the price, so if your temperatures don't often dip below freezing and you're looking for a soft, affordable pair of fall gloves these are good!"
3.0,"It has been peeling at different areas.  I love how cute it is, but the glitter peels from plastic of the band & I have to glue it back."
3.0,"I loved the picture of the sweater but when I got it, it was a bit larger than I expected, kind of itchy and the lower part of the arms had extra material that ballooned out. Very fashionable but not for me."
3.0,"The pin locks seem to work well, but these ones are shorter than the back of a Disney pin. Since it said Disney in the title I figured it would fit. Instead, if you out it on all the way, the pointy end of the pen actually sticks out the back of the lock, and can poke you (or whatever it's resting on). If you don't put the lock on all the way you can make sure the end isn't poking out before you lock it. However, I'm worried it won't stay locked since it isn't on all the way. Seems like a really good lock for pins, just feels misleading that it doesn't fit a Disney pin correctly."
3.0,Very warm but it is a bit big
3.0,Not bad for the price a little on the short side.
3.0,"It looks cool, but the clasp broke the first time I wore it.. It was really tough to open the clasp, then after breaking a fingernail and getting it open, the clasp broke."
3.0,"I liked the shape of this hat and the overall style, but I had to return it for a few reasons. The color had a yellow tint to it (looked cream in the photo, arrived more buttercream), which didn't appeal to me or match my clothes. The size was a little large as well. I have an average head size and there are drawstrings to tighten the fit, but the overall dimensions were too large for my small frame (I'm 5'2&#34;); it looked like I had borrowed my father's hat. However I do like the Fedora style with the wide brim for sun protection. I ended up ordering the Victoria instead, in Camel. The color worked better for me, and the proportions of the hat are smaller (even though the website lists the same dimensions). It works much better on a small person, fits my head snugly without tightening the strings (though still blows off in a big gust of wind), and I have received many compliments on it. For reference, I live in Boston and not many people wear hats for sun protection. So if you're worried about looking bizarre, don't be! Go with the Victoria if you have a small frame - you won't regret it."
3.0,It was pretty but it fit me to small.
3.0,Great dress but I got an XL for me (size 14) and it didn't fit me so I had my daughter try it on who is a size 4 and it fit her perfectly.
3.0,Not soft at all. It actually hurts and left marks on my feet after wearing it for a few hours.
3.0,"Looks nice and big on ear, only looks fake if you really wanted to look up close and personal. I haven't wore it in a while and left it in the box it came with, the backing had some green in it so they're obviously fake. Afraid it'll turn my ear lobe green now."
3.0,Update: I refused the stars given because The chain broke off as I was cross the street. I would love to get a chain replacement if possible. Besides that I really do like this purse and I am not a bag/purse type of gal.<br /><br />Love this purse!! You can remove the chain and use it on the smaller purse. I use the big one for work and switch the chain over to the small one during the weekend.
3.0,Material clings to every imperfection. I don’t think I’m going to avoid undergarment lines
3.0,Beautiful I love it but the back started changing color and irritated my navel
3.0,they are really cute and look just like the pic...however I just feel like they look weird when I put them on. like they don't sit right? I kept them...however have not decided to wear them yet
3.0,These probably fit true to size... I typically wear a 3x (big booty and thighs) and got these in 4x so they would be baggy like sweat pants should be and they were so huge I couldn't wear them... I returned them... Also I'm not going to order a smaller size because these pants had a few dirty spots on them.. I'm not sure if it was from the machine they are made on or what but I was not happy they were dirty so I will not buy again
3.0,i got a size large bc i’m usually a size 5/7 in jeans and stuff so this fit kind of snug! i deff would order a size up bc it is very form fitting! it’s super soft but also kind of thin so be aware lol i got the royal blue and it looks just like the pic!
3.0,These slippers are very comfortable but the arch support was very minimal. I paid extra to have arch support and I didn't see much difference then my bear claw slippers.
3.0,First I ordered the size small. The band fit on the loosest hook but the cup was too small. I liked that it had 4 hooks. I returned them (bought 2). I ordered them in medium. The band was the same size as the small! I kept them because the cup size was larger. Too bad the sizes were not true to size.
3.0,"I bought these bracelets for myself and a friend. I have the white bracelet, and over the first month, the white became discolored off-white, and the knots holding the metal pieces in place had to be run over with glue to prevent them from untying and falling off. I probably wouldn't buy again for the price, but if you aren't a crafty type, just buy these and get super glue for the knots."
3.0,I was surprised at the price for 3 glass bottles.  The glass bottle part is great the nozzles are extremely low quality.  They do dot work well.  Love the glass though.
3.0,"it was a bit on the small side, but it was okay"
3.0,Bought one for my grandson and one for my granddaughter for Christmas. The material is weird but design is cute. I wish they were cotton sweatshirt material. I think these are overpriced. Will be returning if way too large. They look big.
3.0,"The picture shows that the cardigan goes below the butt, but the back ends at the hips. It is smaller in the arms and the material is very thin. I still like it for something to cover my arms with a nice tank top. The overall quality of the product is good."
3.0,"The belt is great, except the color is quite a bit lighter than I was hoping for."
3.0,The socks are adorable however after only wearing them one time they had holes in the toes. My daughter was disappointed
3.0,Love the dress but make sure to order 2 to 3 sizes bigger. I am a US 14 & ordered a 2x and still to small
3.0,Like the price & look. Disappointed that zipper broke right away
3.0,"the quality seems like they could be a bit better but as for the price, you pretty much can't go wrong on these. They really do help, but i feel like they could be improved and cost a little bit more."
3.0,"At least 2 sizes too small.  Cute shoes, but size chart is incorrect."
3.0,My daughter wanted these for her 100 day project but I only received 99. Such a bummer when missing one so she can use all the same beads as requested by her teacher.
3.0,"I knew going in that I wasn't going to get the highest quality sunglasses at this price point but for my needs (I bicycle twice a week) this was more suited for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Great Value - Came with semi hard case and 5 switchable lenses. the lenses also came with a lens case that stored all 5 of them to protect them from scratching.<br /><br />Does the job - the tints do their respective job in terms of what the tint it supposed to do.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Build quality. When i put these on for the first time, i noticed one side was noticeably higher on my face than the other. When i put it on a flat surface, you can tell the build quality was way off. its completely uneven. Some of the lenses don't fit as snugly as others. for example, the red tint fits the frame snugly whereas the black one is very loose. I know that you can't expect the world with sunglasses at this price point but i feel the build quality should be a tad bit better.<br /><br />Overall, if I got a straight/level pair, I'd probably give this 5 stars"
3.0,I love how soft the slippers are and at first I was like these are amazing!!! But unfortunately by the 3rd day the sole padding fell flat. Now it’s like I’m almost walking on the floor. They are cute and warm though.
3.0,"The watch itself is pretty. The price was right. The band is huge and will need to be resized to fit my wrist, and that will mean a trip to the jeweler."
3.0,Very comfortable and stretchy material. A little cheap looking and smells fake. I got a Large in the dark blue and am usually a size 8. They fit well. Wish they looked more like the picture. Overpriced in my opinion.<br /><br />I got the black pair in the XL and they fit very similar to the Large. So not much difference between the two sizes.
3.0,Cute but came with micro holes in the mesh.  It'll be no time before those rip like pantyhose :(
3.0,It's a little hard.
3.0,Overall this was super cute but the Keychain didn't hold out very long. Within a month it broke and turned that bronze brown color. It didn't get wet or anything like that I live in a very sunny place with little to no rain at all and it was clipped onto a flute case so I don't understand how it broke so easily and changed colors quickly :(. The bracelet is still in good condition though it just makes your wrist sweaty if it's hot out.
3.0,"Not top quality, but good for the price."
3.0,"Cute for the time being yet, the top layer does come off easily"
3.0,"Nice quality top, looks very cute on, BUT I ordered yellow and the top I received is NOT yellow, it's lime green.  Will probably wear it, but not as often."
3.0,"Cute vest but it is not a relaxed material, can feel rough. Also, it runs short in length"
3.0,"These socks are SO cute and true to size in my opinion. The quality seems to be really good.. I gave 3 stars because I didn’t receive a gray pair but 2 white pair instead. So if you are buying for a specific color beware, if you don’t care that you will end up with double (or more) of the same color than it should be fine."
3.0,"VERY , very thin. Not at all what I expected."
3.0,"Dress is very pretty but just for the first time itself,  the stitches started coming off"
3.0,Loved this dress. My students loved it!!! Light and comfortable for the constant moving of a kindergarten teacher.
3.0,To bling for me
3.0,These are ok. They are smaller than expected
3.0,The pins wear out. Other than that this is the best band to compliment my GS3 smartwatch.
3.0,"I ordered the larger of the two sizes and it’s huge, like so huge about 1-2” of extra strap.<br />With the factory apple bands I got the larger ones and they fit perfectly with the end of the strap being right in the middle. With all the bands I have ordered in the past for my Apple Watches I always get the XL.<br />This is the only one that’s ever been so long it won’t work.<br />So I think if you wear the apple XL then order this one in the medium."
3.0,The shirt was blousy and nice but the sleeves were tight. Nothing like the loose sleeves depicted in the photo.
3.0,Love the print.  Fabric is fine.  Might have fit in x small but not available :(
3.0,"Very pretty, but shorter than I wanted. My fault for referencing the photo instead of reading the details!"
3.0,"I was so excited to get this and wanted to love this product so bad! I have lower back pain and I have read that posture correctors can help with that. So I read the reviews on this and ordered it right up. The sizing is right on and fit perfectly. It’s essentially a backwards bra. Totally comfortable to wear the entire day. Now here is why I gave it three stars.. It doesn’t have enough of a pull on your shoulders. I don’t have terrible posture, but my chiropractor has said in the past to walk with my shoulders back more so that they are even and not curved in. So I know that my posture needed some help. When I bought this I was expecting it to do just that-to pull my shoulders back and not be as flexible. This pulls them back to an extent and it did relieve my back pain some-but I would not buy this product if I purposely was just trying to fix my my posture. I would probably invest in a better quality one."
3.0,"While these were super cute, they wouldn’t fit tightly on my ear."
3.0,Fabric was cheap a d very lightweight.
3.0,I think I should have order a size up.  I wear 9 and these pair of boots fit like a glove.  It is hard for me to zip up the boots is the reason why I think I should have ordered a size 10.  The burgundy pair looks red.
3.0,The top part is very comfortable. The material of the skirt bunches up in front in a weird way.
3.0,"My biggest issue is that the seam around the neckline is NOT sturdy, almost all of it has come loose at this point. This is especially problematic given the rediculous surplus of fabric on the inside of the neckline, because without a good seam to hold it down the extra fabric flips up and makes it look like you're wearing a VERY awkward bib.<br />The belt is also complete trash. I wish they had just left it out and got rid of the oversize belt loops on the sides of the dress."
3.0,Wanted to like this swimsuit but it was a lil off. Boob area did not fit right.
3.0,"Super cute but HUGE. Bought a newborn size for my daughter that would have had to go back, except I can gift it to my 2 year old niece."
3.0,A lot smaller than what I expected! But nice quality.
3.0,"Great shirt for the price, comfortable and feels good on. Threading started to  unravel after a couple of washes."
3.0,Not bad but a little more faded looking than I expected !
3.0,"Somewhat expensive for what it is. Looks decent, but that's only on one side. Flip it over and you see the cheapness."
3.0,"Nice product but it had a red stain on the shorts by the waist band, other than that, the outfit is ice."
3.0,I really like these shoes.  They are like walking on air and they look made well.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because they shoes and the brand don't make half sizes and the 37 is too small and the 38 to big.
3.0,Read reviews and bought it big so I would not have an issue with the fit. I usually fit into a medium and I bought an xxxl and it's still tight.
3.0,The top is kind of tight but should work Okay
3.0,5'5 144lbs 36c cup ordered a medium....it was too long for me and I clearly dont have the bust to make the top look good. Tried multiple bras and they either showed thru or just not the right lift. The cut outs on the top are very ugly and jagged looking. I dont knonif school kids were making paper snowflakes and decided they'd try it out on clothing but I wasn't too happy about that...
3.0,"Love the feel of the pants but just a bit too skinny for me. Old guy trying to act young!😁 If I was 29 pounds lighter and 20 years younger, these would be perfect!"
3.0,"I bought this for my 12 year old son and he loves the style of it but, after literally wearing it one time, the decals were falling off and I mean almost completely off. They are like iron on patches. I took it to an alteration shop today to have them sewn on. It’s a cheap jacket but still thought it’d be a little better than that. It’s also Asian sizing so we order a couple sizes bigger and it fits fine."
3.0,"The skirt was stiff and longer than I expected. It's nice quality, but I felt like a little girl in it (not in a good way) so I returned it."
3.0,Too small for men with big butts.
3.0,"Mainly as pictured, kind of cheap looking"
3.0,Loved it until the main zipper broke and won't stay shut. Lightly used for two months. Cheap plastic zippers.
3.0,Is it ok
3.0,"The boots fit and I love the print, but the inside of  my boots is coming out. 😑 If it wasn't for that it would be 5 star"
3.0,Padding was lumpy
3.0,this looks good but it didnt last very long the material isnt very strong and broke within days of wear.
3.0,this as a nice jacket. The price was great for the special however it wasn't as thick as I anticipated. The lining is a fleece but it's not a dual liner so it's fairly thin for what I expected from huntsworth. The design of the jacket is just as pictured so no complaints there. It's the perfect jackets to use underneath something but not as a standalone jacket
3.0,Maybe I ordered wrong. This appears to run small
3.0,WAS OK
3.0,It's pretty but I thought it was for my older daughter but it looks like it's for a smaller girl. I'm hoping it will stretch without ruining it so she can wear it.
3.0,The loops fell out after the first wear.
3.0,"It did fine for the first, but not very sturdy"
3.0,My son bought these to try to give us a heart attack. LOL  It didn't work! He easily lost the back of one and then lost the earring. Bought another pair. Same thing.
3.0,4-yr. old grandson loves Ghostbusters.  His mom suggested this for his birthday so I ordered it without paying a lot of attention to it (my problem).  It's a plastic box that actually says it's a costume accessory.  It opens (to put the ghosts in) and has lights.  It's okay for my grandson but another/older kid would probably get more out of it.  I don't think it will get used much at all and I could have found a better way to spend my money.  But don't get me wrong - it's really my problem that I got it for a little kid.  It just doesn't seem like much.
3.0,"Very cute purse, great quality, but it's too small. The opening is difficult to take my items out. Also, the handles are too small/short carry the bag on my arm. I returned it."
3.0,Too small. Bummer. Cute but not as comfortable as my other ugg slippers
3.0,"I ordered the size 10 and it may be a size 11. I was going to exchange them for smaller but they charge $6 shipping, so I’ll gift them to someone. Nice quality for the money and material looks ok but the real test is when they get wet."
3.0,"Cute but very thin, not warm."
3.0,"I like the band for comfort but whenever it is near metal, it will stick to that. I keep losing it in the house by being close to things."
3.0,"It's ok.  The zip is hard for me to zip up.  It has pretty colors but it's not the best material and it's not horrible either.  Mine fit a little high up, however I like the style.  Will keep it."
3.0,"These are pretty, however the scale of the earring is as if it is for a child. Very small. I ordered a lovely necklace that has the same motif however the flowers on the necklace are larger than the earrings."
3.0,"This was such a cute outfit in the picture. I ordered a 3T, the tank top was a bit too snug, especially around the neck. The pants were a little less snug. When the whole outfit was assembled, it just didn't look right. The quality was decent and it looks cute, it's just not for us."
3.0,So I originally bought this in green and it fit and looked fantastic so I decided to buy it in black and white. The black is great but the white is so see through it is unwearable.
3.0,"Nicely made sweater overall and medium to light weight, but fit is rather small."
3.0,"These glasses are so fun & cool, unique, stylish, & trendy. However they broke after 4uses. Came with a warranty but I bought them last summer. Not sure I registered them in time bc LIFE got in the way….😩"
3.0,"I wanted to love this product because somehow I always manage to squash my sunglasses or get them all twisted and whopper-jawed in the line of duty. In reality I would consider 3.5 stars if Amazon let me, but there was one small design flaw (in my opinion) that kept me from rounding up; that flaw was the nose piece. Not even two weeks into owning these sunglasses I noticed the rubber nose piece starting to come off. After a little superglue application I though it would be fine, unfortunately I was wrong and am now missing a nose piece with the other trying to follow suit. I believe this to be a design flaw rather than a &#34;dud&#34; product as there is seemingly not enough anchor for the rubber piece.<br />To correct the issue I will probably drill small holes into the stub the rubber holds onto and fill them with Sugru, which will hold my recreated Sugru nose piece to the frame.<br />Normally I wouldn't complain about something like this, but for a $100+ I'd rather spend a little more for something that will stay together for longer than a week.<br /><br />Other than that the glasses are great, hence it still has three stars. The frame is nearly indestructible. You can sit on it, twist it, and pull it with little worry; the worst that will happen is your lens may pop out.<br />The View and polarization is good, and it doesn't look bad at all.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you get them on sale a little Sugru work may be worth it, but other than that I'd spend a little more on something else."
3.0,A little heavy. Rubber o-rings are thin and fall off easy. Fast shipping and love the idea.
3.0,"Nice dress. Quality material. Sewn right but the dress fits closer to the body and shorter in length than it should. It does not fit loosly like in the picture. Length of skirt short, above the knee and snug to hips."
3.0,Not cotton Material<br />Very see thru
3.0,The hoodie was to small need bigger sizes but I loved the hoodie I bought a xl for my husband and it looked like a mussel shirt and was to short as well
3.0,Cute product but kind of long for what I wanted
3.0,They are not like the expensive kind of shades but they look good on... my second pair I had to order due to them peeling and eventually the tip broke off on one side.
3.0,I bought these for hiking.  They work okay but I don't think they are meant to help a strenuous long workout.  They looked pretty cheaply made when they showed up but looked a little better after being soaked for 20 minutes.  The beads that do the evaporative cooling did a decent job for about an hour and then it was harder to tell a temperature difference.  I did start flipping it around every 10-20 minutes so the cooler part would be next to my skin. Since I was in a hiking situation I could keep wetting the bandana.  I think if you could keep the cloth wetter that would help.  Overall they are probably good for some outdoor chores or hanging out at a bbq in the sun but not fantastic for hiking long distances.  I would wear this again on a 2-3 mile hike but lately I've been doing hikes that last 5-7 hours and if there isn't a water source along the way this is just one more thing to carry.<br /><br />Packaging note: These are in a little cellophane package that could have fit in an envelope.  But it was shipped in a HUGE box that was close to 16x20 with all of the pillow packs so it wouldn't move around inside. I have no idea why they would ship it in something so ridiculously huge.
3.0,"i can't wear underwires yet post surgery, so whenever i see cute bras that are 'wirefree' i am all over it.  plus there were 3 of them so it seemed like a great option.  not a great option.  they are fairly unsupportive.  and they are not truly wirefree - they are Underwire free - there are wires on the that should provide some support but instead they just poke at you and my reduction surgery scars come into that area where those wires are and that's just terribly irritating and uncomfortable.  and they create a bit of a missile look because the 'cup' is just so much.  i am just not really pleased with these bras.  i am behind on laundry they might get worn but otherwise, they are just going to be in a drawer."
3.0,"I wanted to remove a stain on my boot, it didn’t work"
3.0,The color was more yellow than beige and the fabric was so thin you can see through. Over all the fit was great and it was well assembled no thread was loose or frayed.
3.0,It has something white like paint on one of the flowers ....<br />I wanted to exchange it but didn’t think I would get it back before my event
3.0,Had to replace Chainit caught my hair constantly!
3.0,"For the price, I'm a little disappointed. Gives a funny hazy overtone color at times. For the money you pay, should be higher quality."
3.0,The material is good. Size was a little bit loose but I don't think a smaller size would fit anyway. Not something I would wear on a regular bases but good enough to wear outside in the winter to shovel.
3.0,The item is good but too small for their sizes.
3.0,"They look quite cheap. The seams on the heel were visible and didn't seem like they were being held together very well. They also run extremely small. The 9 fit like a 7.5.<br />However, they were comfortable and easy to wear. The sole was kinda squishy and it didn't really feel like you were wearing a heel. Granted I only wore them around the house, and returned them about 20 minutes after I actually received them, but still."
3.0,Wish they made this in an XXL. I need a bigger size for my giant mellon. :-/
3.0,"My husband requested these jeans for a Christmas gift.  Shipping was projected to take a month or longer and it came in half that time.  Quality of the pants are pretty decent - good stitching and hardware, they don't feel or look delicate or like they will would be fragile to wear.  There are raw edges showing on some of the different patches but I think that was part of the design.  Our only problem was the fit.  Ordered my husband's usual jean size of 32 waist and we should have gotten a 38.  Also a slim fit, not baggy like the pictures seem to indicate.  Asked for a return/refund and due to shipping costs the company said to keep the pants and they would do a partial refund."
3.0,"Very easy to break, I’ve worn three of them and they all broke the first time. Very cute though and cheap price."
3.0,"Shirt seems well made. It's stretchy so more fitted than I would have liked, so I won't wear it much as a result."
3.0,The bracelet is okay but it looks nothing like I got in the picture the chains are different style shains. I’m a female and a and the bracelet was too big or my wrist. So I’m wearing it as an arm bracelet. Beware when buying because you’re not getting what is pictured.
3.0,"Cute style, but did NOT like the polyester material!"
3.0,"Sleeves were very tight, especially for an XXL."
3.0,"Necklace is pretty, however not happy with the length ...it's a choker"
3.0,"A very pretty bracelet, but one of the charms was falling off as soon as I opened the package. I was able to tighten it somewhat so that it would stay on."
3.0,Really cute but it doesn't stay on my head very well.
3.0,The robe was very small and I ordered a large.
3.0,"I have a problem with overheating and these fit tight enough that I have that problem when working out at a very moderate level.  No problem with them, it is me."
3.0,"SPAAAAAACE PAAAAANTTTSSS!<br /><br />I can now be one tenth as cool as Peter Dinklage in my 'space pants'.  Space pants.  Space pants!  SPACE PANTS!<br /><br />EDIT:  11/5/17 -  I have worn these pants three times.  I noticed upon washing them in delicate (I always do), that the stitching in the area where the legs of the pants come together at the top (on the inside because I always inside out these types of pants while washing) are loose and there will be a hole soon if I don't try to do something.  While these pants are really awesome and I love them, I don't think I'll be buying another pair from this brand.  I also didn't do any weird bendy things in them.  I just hung around or walked around running errands in these pants.  Oh also, I am a size 4 and I weigh 125lbs.  I ordered the right size for me, I just think the stitching needs improvement.  Or perhaps I got an off pair.  Either way this is my first pair from this company and I don't want to risk buying another pair only to find the same thing.  I would rather stick with what I know and what works.  Sorry Leggings Depot."
3.0,These were nice but smaller than I thought they would be.  The backing was bent when they came but it was easy to bend it back.
3.0,"Its beautiful, but really big. I wish there was a way to make it smaller."
3.0,"The top portion is definitely shorter than what is shown in the pictures on the model. I have also purchased a similar dress from another vendor before and this dress is not even close to the quality. I am 5'9"" and it barely reaches my ankles so length is not good for me. I will keep it because it will be a nice Easter dress but I am not really happy with it overall"
3.0,"Too small for my head. Seem more like for a child. What's worse is, they came along with another shipment that I returned before realizing that these needed to be returned to, and I can't figure out how to return these because I seem to have already used the return options for this shipment. So, now, it appears I'm stuck with these tiny glasses. So, to sum up, if you have a small head, these are for you. If you have a normal to large size head, don't buy these."
3.0,"Grey cameo color/pattern is unique and works well with this style.  The &#34;Nixon Rhythm&#34; is a great &#34;tide&#34; watch, as the chart takes up about 80% of the watch's visible surface.  But as far as telling time goes...the digits in the upper left hand corner are tiny, like a 4 font.  And almost impossible to read without illumination, day or night.<br /><br />So - a cool watch for a long day at the beach, if all you are concerned about is riding tasty waves, and you don't need to be anywhere at any time in particular...."
3.0,"Very pretty but it was too much &#34;bangs&#34; and not enough &#34;hair&#34;. Overall satisfied, just wish half of the wig wasn't all bangs. The wig fits well (slid backwards sometimes) but mostly stayed in place with only two bobby pins."
3.0,Nice looking cap. Returned I did not like the fit.
3.0,Not enough space on the top for long distance vision for my purposes. I wanted to use them to see my gps and drive
3.0,Slightly short and not super warm. Will work if I layer for my outdoor winter walking.
3.0,Need more BIG pieces
3.0,Only putting 3 stars because I just didn't like how they looked on me... Might be good for someone else but didn't look right on me at all
3.0,Smaller than most<br />XL
3.0,"Protects your fob, but that’s about it. Can’t feel the buttons and is a bit difficult to press."
3.0,"Great looking watchband, low quality leather.  The holes stretched out quite a bit and as a result, many of the sensors are unable to work as a result to it being too lose."
3.0,Top is cute so I’ll be wearing that. Bottoms are too short and just looks awkward
3.0,"I wanted a white shawl that I could wear with my wedding dress.  This one was white, but not as white as my dress, so I was not able to use it as I intented to.  The material is soft,  but unless you don't mind that the white is not that white, then go for it."
3.0,"Not the same boot as in the photo, its a different brand"
3.0,I needed a smaller size.
3.0,Had to order next size up to get correct fit
3.0,"I love the pants but I was about to send them back since I was looking for a fit like that for golf.  There are no pockets, gotta have pockets when you play golf, keeping the pants anyway. Are there some golf pants that fit my description?"
3.0,This was exactly what my niece wanted!!! ... but then the pocket just started pulling away and fell off after only a week after opening it. its nice.. good material.. just not made as well as i had hoped.
3.0,"Cute, cheap little belts. I have about a 30"" waist and these fit perfectly with enough left over to do a little knot with some hanging after buckling it. Sadly the red belt's metal tip fell off when I took it out of the packaging but maybe I can glue it back on. The dark brown and tan haven't fallen apart but I haven't worn them out yet either. I didn't plan on wearing the red much so I'll keep the other two. Will update this review if the others break as well."
3.0,They will do the job (which is resemble a snowman) but they aren’t worth $6. If I saw them at a store for $6 I wouldn’t have paid it.  They’re dollar store quality. And the carrot nose is about 1/2 the size as it looks in the pic. And they run pretty big - adult size. They fall off my 8 year old’s face.
3.0,The first tier goes across bust line.  Other similar shirts i have start the tier below the bust.  I am only an A cup.  I would ti k on a little girl it may be ok.
3.0,they are a little shorter than I wanted
3.0,I love the color but in the description picture it seems bigger/fuller than what I received. If it had more feathers it would be awesome. The camera can be tricky!
3.0,Would be a cute dress but even ordering larger than I wear it's still to small by at least 2 sizes
3.0,they are extremely small...
3.0,Not a true 2X !!
3.0,"I really like the dress, but it has a tendency to bunch up when sitting down. When I wore it the first time, I realized the left pocket had not been sewn shut. My phone fell down my leg."
3.0,"At least when I tried this on, it looked sloppy and not as defined as in the pictures.  It does function for keeping the sun out of my eyes, though, and the material feels like straw and is breathable, unlike polyester hats."
3.0,Cute on mut very short lime my cheaks hang out the back lol
3.0,"this dress felt like a large t-shirt, I didn't care for the feel of the material and also the part that had the runched area didn't hit in the right area for me so it just didn't fit right. maybe I wasn't tall enough to carry it off, I am 5'4"". I returned it and received a prompt refund, no complaints there"
3.0,"When I saw the picture of the person modeling this shirt, I thought it would be a cute warm sweater for the winter.  Not at all true.  This will not keep you warm on a cold day, the material is so thin if you hold it up to a light you can see through it.  That said it's a cute shirt and if you wear a cami underneath it on a mild day you will be fine."
3.0,"Actually, it was really small. I love them but they're too small for my husband face. I need at least 130 mm to 140mm, approximately. For the other side the merchandise was in excellents conditions and shipment was on time."
3.0,I ordered the earrings for my ear.<br />I think they are for young children.<br />When I put the earring in my ear and put the back on my ear was folded up and it felt uncomfortable.<br />I love the earrings and the designs on them but they arent for me.
3.0,The earrings are rose gold to my surprise. The  photo and description does not show or say that.
3.0,"It's a little bit large for me as a 5' 2&#34;, skinny person, and it is a little but hard to adjust. It also tilts in funny directions. It's has a pretty design and decent detail. I definitely looks just like the picture. I would recommend this if you don't mind messing with it a lot."
3.0,I went by the measurements that were provided and decided to get a medium thinking I would have a little room but it was way too small. Go up a size if you want it to fit right.
3.0,"The material is yummy and I loved the color, just not a fan of the draped back, I didn't notice that in the pictures"
3.0,Petite sizes
3.0,"I got a completely different top kind of disappointing, but I will make it work"
3.0,"This scarf does not lay flat, it is more like a puffy cloud. It is see through and has a textured look to it. For the price, size and colors I'm willing to overlook the imperfections.  Be aware the foul chemical oder, is really hard to fully get rid of. I washed my scarf by hand 5 times. I soaked the scarf in soapy water over night as well. This cleaning method took 70% of the horrid smell away, but be warned ⚠️"
3.0,"These seem very good out of the box. My daughter could almost walk up walls with all the extra grip from the super soft and gummy sole. However after not putting them on her for a week, the sole actually curled on one, to the point it deformed the shoe and is unusable. I think that must be an oddity. However I will also tell everyone this; the tread wears very fast, so these will not be hand-me-downs. Other then that, the random curl thing, they are worth the money."
3.0,Very nice looking and good quality. I felt they were more just standard sunglasses than fit over glasses sunglasses. They didnt begin to fit over either the frames or ear pieces. Returned but wish they wouldve worked!
3.0,"little tight, but overall beautiful."
3.0,"I was pretty happy with these. I got the pack of 30 and out of those there were only 5 that didn't fit, or wouldn't stretch enough.<br /><br />When I pulled them out of the bag they had an awful smell. That went away after washing. Straight out of the bag I didn't notice anything wrong with them (like loose seams or holes), after washing them I found a few loose seams but only one had a hole in it.<br /><br />In the pack was 1 medium, 18 large, 4 xl, 3 XXL, and 4 unmarked. I usually wear large underwear. The medium stretched enough but was a little tighter than I usually like, I can still wear them occasionally. Of the large, there were a few that fit like most larges I get but most were a little tight. The extra larges were all tight and fit slightly smaller than a large, they'll still work but they're a lot smaller than expected. 2 of the XXL fit like larges, but look like granny panties, and will be great for sleeping in, and the other one was a Joe Boxer thong which was slightly surprising but they were too big and weren't too cute. 3 of the unmarked ones fit like a small and the other fit like a medium.<br /><br />The variety was amazing. There was mostly lace, some nylon, some cotton, and a couple mesh. Most of them were g-strings and thongs and a bikini, 2 boyshort, and a high waisted pair."
3.0,"Too long, but I still loved it..I just tried it in the back, HOWEVER!, it rusted on me, which I hate because I really did love it."
3.0,I wasn't expecting them to be cloth material. they were very cute for a couple of hours. They got dirty very quickly
3.0,Chain is not long enough.
3.0,"The pendant is lovely, but the chain broke the first hour I wore it, very flimsy.  Thankfully I was home and used a chain from another necklace that is more sturdy and actually looks better with the pendant.  Packaged nicely if you give this as a gift, but think about buying a nicer chain."
3.0,"Fit and length were good. The waist seam was high, about 1 1/2 inches above my waist. I am 5ft 7. Perhaps height should be part of the size chart. The material was very comfortable."
3.0,"Looks cheap on, but is fine for halloween."
3.0,"Had to return it because it had a mildew smell to it, I thought it will air out but it didn’t."
3.0,It was a beautiful ring but sadly it turned my finger green. Other than that it's perfect.
3.0,"I am a little disappionted with the necklace compared to the 6-7mm white Freshwater Pearl Necklace. The surface is not smooth and lack of bright. I am thinking of return it at first, but have no time to do that."
3.0,"A little too lightweight, but comfortable."
3.0,"The necklace was not very strong, broke with minimal effort within a few days of purchasing."
3.0,"Quality and fabric are nice!  My problem with the dress is that the “empire waist” is too low, the seam  hits midway between waist and bust line.  Its such an odd waistline, like it could not make up its mind if it should be a waist line seam or empire.  Result is it looks cheap, like a homemade dress. IF you  buy it, I’d try getting a smaller size so bust line is tighter. I returned my large. I’m 5’9” normal weight."
3.0,"I loved the print of this dress (five stars for that!) but the fabric was kinda clingy which made it feel snug. The waist isn't a true empire waist, so it wasn't flattering on me. I debated whether or not to keep it, but ultimately decided to return it."
3.0,I couldn't find a size chart for these so had to wing it! I read reviews and figured we would go bigger ( kiddo usually wears size 7-8 or 10-12 size bottoms- has been in between those size for most Target suits). We got the 10-12 of these and they are new but look like they must have been shrunk or something! The size 7-8 at Target and Walmart etc have been a little snug but fit best. In THESE the 10-12 bottoms would not go on and the top looked like it was strangling her after we sweat tugging it onto her!  She did love the print and they seem like decent/typical quality...with the sales stores have been having it's only a meh deal to risk the sizing issues. Also looked like it might just be because of the way they are structured. I don't feel sure a bigger size would help without the very top of the suit/straps being super baggy. (Not a chubby girl either lol).
3.0,"It's great. Doesn't stand up well as I expected, but the price was good for what it is. Items can slide from one section to another, as the sections are open underneath. If those were closed, I'd give it 5 stars."
3.0,Love the color but the picture is not as detailed as I would like.  But I will work with it
3.0,This product looks exactly as it does in the picture.<br />it is great quality and beautifully made<br />the colors look fantastic<br />the only thing i found very disappointing was the size<br />now in the picture it looks like a cover up that will at the very least cover up to the butt<br />but when i received and tried on the product it was quite small<br />it was like a shirt more than anything<br />i  think this product would be well for a person who is a size small or extra small<br /><br />i received the product at a discounted rate  for my honest review
3.0,"this shirt is a little big in the stomach area, beware. maybe it's meant to look 'billowy' but it just makes me look pregnant."
3.0,"I usually wear a large in regular  t-shirts, 14-16 size dress.  I ordered an XL because I am a busty girl.  This dress was too big on me especially in the armpit area.  It does look a little cheap.  If it would have fit I may have kept it, but I could have probably gone down a size or two and been okay.  I am 5'1'' and the dress came to the floor when I didn't have any shoes on.  I don't want to pay shipping again (I'm cheap LOL) so it's getting returned..."
3.0,"The material is not really jean, or is it just really soft jean material. its ok, looks better in the picture"
3.0,"buckle is too wide for the band, otherwise fist well on watch"
3.0,I love this dress! The style is cool and the pockets are the best. I would have given more stars except the stitching in the middle already is coming undone after one wear. Otherwise I love it.
3.0,"Bought it for my boyfriend as a Christmas present, he wears an XL in all his t-shirts so I got him an XL and it is waayyy to big! Fits more like a 2X"
3.0,This is another pair of yoga pants I would not buy again the color is great the material was fine but once again the size was way too long by going through what sizes they say you should order from they also had to be cut 3 in in hemmed just so I can wear them and I will only wear them around the house I will not wear them in public
3.0,"The leather is a nice quality but interior fabric is &#34;loose&#34; on the inside so smaller items get stuck in it and lost. Try to pull out wallet at store and fabric came with it causing items in my purse to fall out. EXTERIOR is nice, good quality but interior fabric needs to be secured especially in such a large purse. Exterior 4 stars. Interior 1 star. Bummed out. So I bought an amazing Coach purse equal in size at Nord''s on clearance for same price!!! Fix interior and would be 5 star. Thanks"
3.0,"Normally a medium, ordered a medium, and they're a bit big.. I'm 6 feet tall and 140 pounds, normally a size 4/6 or 27/28 in pants. They're not long enough but I didn't expect them too because I'm so tall. I roll them into capris."
3.0,Able to pull it off
3.0,"I was so excited when I saw this set I ordered them w/o thinking twice.  They sat in my cart for 10 min while I added other items to the cart. My husband even haggled w me to give him 1 of them.  I was sadly disappointed when I got them tho.  I've been wearing them at work, getting compliments on them but wish they were just a little thicker. My husband still wants to wear them so they'll get used for sure."
3.0,"I’m 5’5 & usually a size 6 in jeans, sm/med top & I ordered a small. Dress is very cute but not very flattering on me. I feel like it swallowed me & since it was missing the sash/belt it didn’t help. Material reminded me of a cheap pillow case (almost swishy pant feeling) & pretty thin."
3.0,"These pajamas are made of surprisingly thick cotton. The pattern is a fuzzy felt-like fabric, not silk screened as I though it would be. The legs are a little short which is fine for my son who has short legs. My major critique is that there are too few snaps along the legs/groin so his diaper shows when he is sitting. This is a major drawback as I wanted to use this suit for photo ops."
3.0,Have to send it back... bust is way too large.
3.0,The material is great but I went by the suggestion of the site base on my height and the dress doesn’t fit correctly and is too long.
3.0,"they are borderline cheap but do work, almost like a child's pair would. Nothing is a bargain anymore, you get what you pay"
3.0,My boyfriend wears an 11 and the 11’s are to small
3.0,"I like the material, my daughter is on the taller side she felt like the top was too short.  the bottoms fit as expected!"
3.0,"The photo and description were true -  when I received the necklace however, the over all appearance looked too costume jewelry for my taste.  I sent it back."
3.0,They’re ok. Nothing special except the color. Not especially comfortable.
3.0,Runs a little small in size. Getting a size bigger is ideal for this product.
3.0,I think the dress is pretty And good quality but the sizing is off... I wear a L and Xl in everything. And had to send bck to get a 2xl then that was to big.
3.0,It didn't hold up well even in light wind. It flipped & I had to struggle to get it back. It was ok only for sun or light rain.<br />It surely is light weight & fits easily in a small bag.
3.0,Blocks the some lights but not the led lights.  They are ok but most vehicles now have led lights.
3.0,Appears more burgandy than purple.
3.0,"I ordered the XL hoping that this tank would be good to go with my workout clothing. I figured it would be a little big (I am usually a M/L in tops) but this is gigantic. I probably could have gotten the medium and been fine with the fit. The material seems to be good quality, fairly soft reminds me of a thick knit basic t-shirt material. Washing and drying did not shrink this top at all. Its wide and way too big."
3.0,This dress is super cute but unfortunately just too puffy for me.  Great quality and not see through so I think if I were thinner and shorter it would have been great. I am 5'9&#34; about 170 and ordered a large.  The fit was accurate (couldn't have worn a M) but the puff made me look like a Hershey kiss. I returned it.
3.0,Too small. Followed size chart
3.0,"Looks better on her, didn't fit like the picture around my shoulders."
3.0,it is what it is-but the synthetic stone is very plasticy and not that glossy. It's okay.
3.0,I had to cut the eye holes out because I couldn't see. But creepy enough to scare some people!!
3.0,"I bought 2g set. They are too short. They fall out easily. Right size for my holes, but too short length wise. Its like they were trying to skimp out on material to male more profit."
3.0,My gf liked it
3.0,It smelled weird. Too tight on my head. The words were done sloppy.
3.0,Errkay
3.0,Fit just a tad bit smaller but not snug smaller. The hole was too small for me to put my head through (and no I dont have a big head).
3.0,Vendor did NOT indicate that it makes White furred dog neck grey black where it goes around neck . I thought S/S would solve that problem that w/chrome steel chains did . S/S did NOT solve that problem. Thanks
3.0,Lens a little darker than anticipated.  Light weight and pretty comfortable.  Cannot fold the glasses since no hinges...minor inconvenience.
3.0,Very nice sweatshirt but seems to run a little big maybe. Very warm tho for sure. Gonna wash and dry it trying to shrink it down a bit. I did notice the tag said the suggested retail price is $45 and they are selling it for more which is kinda lame.
3.0,"It keeps on falling. I guess my baby is too active causing the pads to fall down to his shins. Other that that when it does stay on, his knees are protected when he crawls or walks on his knees"
3.0,"Very beautiful and quality shirt, however it shouldn’t be labeled as “loose fitting”. I bought the large and it was way too small for me. For reference I’m 5’8” 150lbs, so the large should have fit me. My 9 year old daughter stole it and is loving it. I think the sizing must be meant for teens or something."
3.0,Ordered this for my teenage daughter. The top fit ok but the bottoms ran a bit big. The ruching across the front of the bottoms is not sewn well so the material just hangs there and looks bulky. We ended up returning the suit.
3.0,Cool looking but bottom twists to far . If I straighten it it's loose. It falls out... other wise it's cool looking.
3.0,Fabric quality does match cost. Functional and not awful.
3.0,devil horns were amazing!!! spider’s legs dig into your scalp so must be worn backwards. Too late to return :/
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but the fit is like a size 10.  Will have to return."
3.0,Packaging does not protect the hat from getting squished in shipping. It fits well and I'm sure will look cute once it gets the shape it's supposed to.
3.0,"I’m 5’3” about 105lb. and the fit was too loose in the upper portion. It looked more like a loose crew neck t-shirt and the sleeves were loose and long like t-shirt sleeves. Overall, it was not flattering on at all. I was really looking forward to getting this dress, but disappointed it wasn’t as pictured. I returned it."
3.0,"the calf's are tight, so if you have a soccer play daughter I would pass. However they fit my thin legs with no problem."
3.0,"So, I am 5'1"", I am 180. I wear a 36F size bra. I ordered this in an extra large. The bathing suit is really cute, bottoms fit great and were very flattering, however the top... the top covered about 1/4 of my breast. I am disappointed, only because it didn't fit. Thought about keeping it for the bottoms, but its not worth me buying another suit. I returned this item."
3.0,"The sole portion of the sock says ""Fruit of the Loom NB"" in grey skid proof material. It looks ridiculous to have that on newborn socks (sole portion is so small) because it takes up the entire portion and who wants to see that. If you must advertise at least they could have put it in white to blend."
3.0,Well the suit could be cute but I was sent two very different sizes...the top was huge and the bottom was tiny. The color is not so accurate...the turquoise is really more greenish blue. The suit would have been very cute if it was the right color and size.
3.0,"Finish is coming off after 5 months. Wallet is about 1&#34; longer than it really needs to be, so it takes more space in a pocket than it ought to. Because of extra wallet length, credit card slots are extra wide and cards can easily fall out if you don't pay attention. Can't say whether it protects my electronic data or not."
3.0,It's 50/50 cotton/polyester.  Thought it was more cotton than that.  Oh well.
3.0,I love my bag! But just like another customer my strap broke and I’ve only had it for a little over a month.  I emailed but did not get a response. It’s disappointing because it’s really a great bag.
3.0,"Took way too long to arrive. Seems like good quality. Bought 2 one arrived on time. After 3 weeks, buckle fell off. Managed to hammer it back."
3.0,"good service, okay ear cuffs"
3.0,"I like it, but it does not fit my Samsung Galaxy watch 4 Classic."
3.0,"The clasps were not made very well.  It came off in a theater.  I was lucky to find it under the seat.  Now I have to use paper clips to fasten it bent with plyers.  When I wear it, I have to put it over my head now as it is permanent with tape on the back of paper clips<br />I do not want to loose it again."
3.0,Ordered a size up and it didn't fit. It's a cute top!
3.0,So I did a record<br />The first one was great<br />The 2ed one was not like the 1st one and is not as nice as the 1st one
3.0,We have definitely had better water shoes in the past.
3.0,So excited to have these adorable chains. They came in very cute bags with a note from the seller and a cleaning rag. My husband loved it and he rarely gets excited with gifts. The seller is great. They delivered it before the scheduled time and they work with u if u are having any issues.
3.0,"I am in between sizes, I can wear either a medium or small depending on sizing. I originally got a medium but returned it for a small... was bummed since the small still ran big and the material is super thin. I decided I like the design and just to lazy to return it so I'll be keeping it. You will definitely need a slip under this dress since the material is incredibly thin."
3.0,"Price discounted for an honest opinion. So the boots without the inserts won't fit, which is nothing bad. They are actually pretty comfortable. They are very warm and do what they are suppose to. However, on the waterproof side, only the bottom part (rubber) is waterproof. I bought them to ride on a motorcycle when raining, but at the end of a 30 minuts ride under the rain, my socks were not soaked, but they were wet. Other than that, nice boots."
3.0,Very cute outfit! Too bad it's wayyyyy too short for me. I'm 5'9 and it needs about 10 more inches of material. If you're tall don't waste your money.
3.0,Too small and can’t see that well out of it hope u can improve a bit
3.0,"Too small, didn't like so returned."
3.0,Nice hoodie however I have had this item a very short time just days and the cuffs are already showing signs of wear. This is worrisome as a hoodie ought to have a longer life in good condition
3.0,"Love love love the color. Love the length. Love the material. But the hood is huge. It must be made to wear over a helmet, because when I pull the hood up, it falls down and completely covers my eyes. And while I love the concept of being able to wear as a rain coat or a fleece jacket or both...it just seems like way too much trouble to undo all the zippers...especially if you get to hot while using. I'm 5'8"" and 155 lbs and I'm between a L and an XL. I bought an XL in case I wanted to wear over bulky sweater...but alas it was too big."
3.0,Just did not wear well  the sleeves are uncomfortable  and did not flatter my body type. I rarely wear it
3.0,Loved it the first month but it's now losing its silver tone. I thought it was going to be a long lasting ring but it's comparable to the price. Sucks because I really like the design and how it fit on my finger. Good for costume jewelry but not long term.
3.0,The necklace itself iS cute and good quality I just received the wrong name plate.
3.0,"This dress is very cute, but the somewhat loose waffle knit texture caused a big hole to form on the first day my daughter wore it, and she doesn't play rough at all."
3.0,Not very good quality.  Said leather it's not
3.0,didnt like to small for face
3.0,"I had luck with half of the set, but not the others. Some of them need to have the option to connect it in the ear. Other than that I had no problems."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, just not what I was looking for. Smaller than what I expected and the blue hues are brighter than they look in the picture."
3.0,"I thought this would be heavier weight by the pictures. This is a nice hat and gaiter, but they are very lightweight and do nothing to stop any wind."
3.0,The xl felt like a medium.
3.0,"I liked the size & quality of the gemstones, the chain is heavy duty & just the right length but also adjustable. The only dislike was the caps that hold the stones are pressed on crooked making these nice necklaces look really cheap made..."
3.0,look good but hurt and don't fit well
3.0,Size runs a little small. Order a size up.
3.0,"I'm surprised I didn't find any other reviews that mentioned that this dress is see-through. I got the white, grey, and light pink geometric print. Being that the majority of the dress is white and the fabric is not very thick - the dress was completely see-through, regardless of what undergarments I was wearing. I think had I gone with a darker option, it may have been okay.<br /><br />I would also caution anyone who is ""thicker"" through your bottom half.  I sized up to a large to account for my hips, thighs, and butt - and it was still not big enough. The top half was huge on me, but the bottom got hung up on my hips -  making the dress look very ill fitting. For size reference: I am 5'7"" and 165 lbs. I wear a medium shirt - about 36"" through my bust but 41"" through my hips - a  size 11/29 jean."
3.0,"I like that this has all of the different pockets.  The quality seems good so far.... but, will have reserve final opinion until this one outing is done.  What I’m giving three stars for is the size of the bag itself.  Yes, I can and did read the description.  For me I guess, the photo makes it look at least half as much longer than it really is."
3.0,As recommended I sized up and it fit very awkward. I would have preferred  loose or tight all around but not such an uneven fit.
3.0,Wasn't as big as I thought
3.0,"Very cute, but didn't come with backs. The hooks are thin and I had trouble finding backs that held securely."
3.0,Gold tarnished after a few wears. One clasp was bent sideways so unusable. Overall great for a few uses.
3.0,"Great product. I have in black, silver and gold. Perfect for smaller wrists. Easy to change size by removing links. Easy to take on and off my watch face. Fits my Gen 4 Fossil watch.<br /><br />Update- purchased about a 9 months ago, if you wear them pretty consistently they seem to tarnish easily. Has a few worn down areas, not too noticeable but will have to replace soon."
3.0,"Cute shorts. I purchased the green camo ones also. I am a 6ft tall, 230 lb woman.  I normally need  a XL or XXL, but 8 read some reviews that said they run a little big. THEY ARE RIGHT. I purchased a  LARGE, and it fits pretty well. If I was going to make it perfect,  I would make the tighter undershorts longer, so my legs don't rub. Other than that, they fit nicely."
3.0,"I live in a windy area and still haven’t found a sturdy umbrella. This one is no different except which part fails. The vertical part or main shaft is also bent but only slightly. However, when you look out you can see it is obviously bent. Since this model rotates, it is really obvious it is bent as seen during rotation. I can’t seem to find parts either otherwise I’d be buying parts and repair them. In this case I will have to re-engineer by fabricating a heavier metal end then welding this heavier metal to the existing piece and re-drilling the holes. I will obviously continue my search for a sturdier umbrella or search for parts. I’m ok replacing parts as long as each version is made a bit sturdier. Perhaps someday I’ll be selling an upgrade kit for this unit on Amazon to recoup my costs."
3.0,"This is a very nice necklace - with an adjustable black rope (which is cool). It is a little bigger, thicker, and heavier than I expected (hence the 3-star rating). I guess I was expecting something more comparable to a traditional Chinese coins. That said, though, the detailing on the coin is beautiful and it's a very striking necklace."
3.0,Quality material but size was too large
3.0,I have very large calves and my other lish wide calf black compression socks fit great. These ran much smaller and i couldn't get them pulled all the way up.  They are cute tho if your calves aren't as wide.
3.0,It says YSE 😑
3.0,They are light weight and fabric seems nice enough but the zipper is too flimsy.
3.0,Velcro patch is cheap and failed within 1 month. I advised swapping to a buckle. The strap clip digs into you as you where it. I would like to see better placement of the d-ring to remedy this. Aside from that I like the bag. Just a couple flaws.
3.0,it was early
3.0,The pattern didn't show well it was dull
3.0,Had to return my normal size. Otherwise looks good.
3.0,Fabric is uncomfortable and stiff. Fit is accurate.
3.0,The watch is smaller than I expected but it's still nice.
3.0,It keeps falling off.Needs a stap around the heel also.Maybe would stay on better
3.0,"El artículo cuando lo recibo me encantó el diseño el color todo, pero mi hijo lo uso solo una vez en la piscina y la tela se dañó completamente se puso horrible con pelusas y desteñida, quería comprarla en mas colores pero la calidad no es buena es perder dinero"
3.0,"Cute dress.  It was well made, but I thought ran very small.  I returned the dress because I just don't wear my clothes tight."
3.0,This shirt fits extremely short. I didn't like the fit at all.
3.0,"Cute, but very see through. The pockets buldge a bit so if you have a curvy hourglass body; this DOES Add a bit of a lumpy volume to those hips."
3.0,Size up if you want the lose for like the picture. This is form fitting at TTS super cute shirt and it is thin. I like it
3.0,Like them a lot but the removable padding comes out in the wash
3.0,This is an elegant bracelet at a very reasonable price.
3.0,They are a little bit short for the largest luggage.
3.0,"sixing info not accurate, i followed sizing guide and its a bout 2 size larger. was going to return, ended up giving it to friend, and she loves it."
3.0,"Size wise I ordered based on dress size, not waist measurements. The waist measurements told me I'd be almost a L/XL. The small fit best. I'm 5ft 2, 130lbs. I love this dress, but I ordered to sizes for fit checks and the medium sent was the wrong size which is why I said 3 stars. I ordered purple which the small was, but the medium I think was the maroon. Good thing the small was the better fit."
3.0,Its cute but it gets tarnished easily so male sure to take off when talking showers
3.0,"It's stiff and conforms to ya like cardboard. I washed it and it's the material. I have a 20 yr. old North Face,the bubble type, $200 vest and it's a completely different animal.I love it. The Aconcagua collar or neck. is stiff as hell and uncomfortable It's the cheap poly material.It looked good in the pic but sucks!"
3.0,"Not that comfy, too tight."
3.0,Runs small. I received it with a hole in one pocket. Too much hassle to return. Will not be ordering again
3.0,"Super cute! Bottom fits perfectly, but the top is too small :("
3.0,"Comfortable, nice fit, but very ugly."
3.0,Breaks easy at the seams but otherwise comfortable.
3.0,Will bleed on sheets
3.0,The glasses are cute! But no case or even a box to store them in
3.0,I love the bottoms! But the top is way too small. I'm a 38DD so i ordered the biggest size and it is too small to wear.
3.0,"I was excited about this item and was disappointed when I received it. It was much larger than a ""small."""
3.0,this wallet has a strong odor
3.0,"Great support, but after a couple of months. Not durable at all."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this dress but the top portion at the bust is a bad fit for my C cup.  It fits everywhere else and is really cute as a dress since I'm 5'3"".  It is a soft material. I really like the yellow color.  It is in between a medium yellow and a mustard. <br /><br />I think this would be cute for an A cup but there is a seam that cuts right right across my bust and makes it look like they have no where to go.  This makes it unwearable for me."
3.0,This skirt fits well and is comfortable but we had to send another one back because seams were already unraveled. Too bad.
3.0,"I would definitely say go with your gut instinct on what size you need. For me on the chart it said order a medium, I did and it’s so small on me. I probably should’ve order and XL by the look of this."
3.0,"Great product, but doesnt fit as expected. If you are Large, buy two sizes bigger"
3.0,The bottom fits me just right I loved it. But the top was a lil too little for my bust. I order a xl
3.0,I didn't receive the belt that was supposed to come with the jumper
3.0,"The hat is okay.  It arrived in a plastic bag, wrinkled and the brim a bit creased.  It had a chemical smell that went away after a while.  Quality was less than I expected, loose threads clearly visible here and there.  Costco carried a hat with a back flap, but the quality was much, much better and the price about the same.  I don't know if the brim on the Costco hat was as wide.  The inside of the brim is made of polyethylene (PE), a foam-like plastic used to make disposable visors.  The PE helps keep the brim from getting floppy and at the same time maintain some flexibility.  The wide brim in the front and on the sides does a good job of keeping the sun off my face which is the primary reason I purchased it. The lightweight material keeps my head from getting overly heated.  Don't expect to make a fashion statement with this cheaply made hat.  Honestly, you will stick out like a sore thumb if you wear this hat poolside at the Hilton.  It's great for gardening.  If you pack it for travel, expect it to get wrinkled.  The darker colors will not show the wrinkles as much as the lighter ones.  If you're more concerned about sun protection and not about looking chic, this hat will do the trick."
3.0,The Opals are pretty but paired with that color gold makes them look bad.
3.0,This dress was very comfortable and flattering. I have 3 stars only because it’s a tad see through (like in the chest of the light hits it right) and I haven’t had it long enough/put it through the wash enough to know it’s quality.
3.0,"The color of the actual leggings is a deep, dark purple, not the bright and light purple seen in the picture! But they are comfortable to wear and fit well. The material is not too thin and not too thick. Nice to wear with a coordinating dress or for exercising."
3.0,"a lovely dress, but a bit too fitted."
3.0,"I wasn't sure what size to order for these due to all the reviews saying they run small. I usually wear a small in athletic leggings but ordered a large in these because of that. They are a bit big so I could have used a medium, but I think they may have been a bit short in the legs then. I like them long...ankle length. They are nice but not much for spandex compression. Very good looking though and really not see-through. Not sure I'd order them again as I like more compression in my leggings."
3.0,"This wasn't an expensive top in was very reasonably priced. The top is cotton and is nice, it is not made from an expensive material but it is not horrible.<br />It fits true to size, the colors are pretty and it looks really nice on. I like the fact that the back of the t shirt dips lower at the back, as I like tops which cover my butt.<br />This T Shirt would pair nice with jeans especially white jeans or shorts on vacation.<br />You can't go wrong at this price"
3.0,My nephew likes it. He's a skater and likes lightweight hoodies. It's good for warms but no to think for excessive sweating. He's happy.
3.0,"This top has a very nice fabric- silky and thick. However, I would say it runs about 2 sizes too small. I have purchased a few other tops of this design from other Amazon venders and an XL always fits. I wear XL tee shirts. I normally wear a size 14-16 in pants. I will have to exchange or return this top."
3.0,"Loved the sayings, just runs a little on the small size"
3.0,"Zipper leather is much darker than my desert boot, looks weird."
3.0,It's cute but I broke the first day I put it on.
3.0,Came broken/missing stones- still cute though not worth a return for the price.
3.0,Fits well. Right size. Arrived close to the time I anticipated. I would have liked it to be slightly longer.
3.0,I really like the style of this shirt! But I wish it could have been a bit longer! I ordered the xlg after reading the reviews! I weight 154 lbs!
3.0,"I normally wear a men's extra-large, I ordered a 2XL and it was still too small only about the same size as men's medium!!! Other than the sizes being way off, the shirt seems nice the fabric is very soft and would be very comfortable if you could get the shirt to fit"
3.0,"They're &#34;ok&#34;.  Similar to dollar store glasses. I dont think they'll last more than a few times of wearing them, but we shall see. I gave it 3 stars because the hard case they came in was decent.... the glasses themselves? Meh."
3.0,The color is gorgeous and I'm kind of bummed i didn't go one size smaller. I would say if you have an hourglass figure size down because the waist runs a tad larger that most skirts. I wish it had pockets and it's a little long on my 5'3 frame. The skirt falls to about my mid calf.
3.0,"The material was a little tight on me, but it's a nice blazer."
3.0,It was cute but I felt that the top was too big and the bottom was too short...and I’m not small on top so it was strange. I returned it because I didn’t love it like I thought I would.
3.0,Wrong size but used it anyway
3.0,cross point screw driver is too large for extra small screws.
3.0,"Fit is okay, looks to be rather badly made however and I don't expect them to last. Also took way too long to arrive"
3.0,"I didn't like how the color of the ""brown"" leather band. It's more of an orange. It's not even British Tan. I purchased it because the clasp was rose gold. I think I'll keep it because of the mesh band, but will definitely purchase a new true brown leather band."
3.0,"I returned because I did not like how it looked on me. It should have been a different fabric, it just did not hang right."
3.0,"Fits smaller than expected small neck hole, I got a medium and it fit like a small"
3.0,They were cheap so I didn't expect much but they did fall apart pretty fast. A handful of uses on the beach and they were coming apart.
3.0,"These are cute, not badly made for the price.  My only problem is that they are a bit too long.  I really wish they would make these in something other than &#34;one size fits all.&#34;"
3.0,Nice pants but too slim for my husband.
3.0,Nice dress but runs to small arm part is for small arm people but the dress is cute
3.0,"The idea is so cute with these earrings. The smallest ones i put in my cartilage and they are the perfect size. They do bend very easily and since you have to bend them to put in your ears they don't go back to the round shape. Still really cute, just wish they were a bit more durable."
3.0,Nice dress but a bit smaller than anticipated so I had to send back. Would just recommend going up a size more than you normally would when ordering. No problem returning.
3.0,"I love this dress, The design is super cute. Problem is its not true to size. It states so in the description, so I ordered a size up. I am bigger in the chest area and this dress has no stretch whatsoever. It was so tight I don't even think the next size up would work for me. If you are flat chested you can probably get away with this dress (still sizing up) but stay away if you have a large chest. I am disappointed because the dress is so cute."
3.0,Arrived broken and had to return. Otherwise would have been fine.
3.0,"I got a ton of compliments on this. I really stood out and this set me apart from everyone else! I loved it but then one hour into the event i bent and extended my extended my arm and the jacket ripped. The jacket and the dress fit perfectly, it was not snug I had some room to move but it just could not handle the pressure! poor seam work really. I will have to fix the jacket because I will be wearing again. I just wish it had better quality material. Also the “belt” for the gun or whatever is sewn into the jacket. I didn’t like that. I will have to carefully remove that. The belt also like to snag at the jacket every time ur arms go back and forth that was super annoying."
3.0,"The purse was extreme fashionable. It was the perfect size and material. The small purse inside was my favorite. I loved the set except the large bag came with a deep crease in the front from packing and shipping. I attempted to remove the crease; however, it would not go away. Loved the set. I would've gave it 4 stars. Consider not folding the bag when packing to ship."
3.0,A little large and would like better made in United States instead of china and wish it said U.S.Army  Military Police Veteran or Military Police U.S. Army Veteran
3.0,Make sure you check if it will work for you.  Returning not so easy.
3.0,"very cheap sandal , after only one weeks on the beach they are very used and i need another pair ....doesn't worth to buy them only use in the shower .."
3.0,The dress looks better on the models.  The fit is awful and the colors are not as vibrant.  very disappointed
3.0,"I thought the neckline was great and loved the tie to give it a nice waist for the dress. I just didn’t like the sleeves. The mesh was too big for my arm size and rumpled looking. Returning. Lots of potential, just not the right fit."
3.0,Like the shoes but ordered wrong size. It was hard to figure out.
3.0,Esta lindo pero con una vez que se lo puso mi hija se descosió
3.0,"Made out of felt, not velvet as advertised."
3.0,"Very thin and very, very long..."
3.0,"Good quality, but returned HUGE<br />Exchanged for 2X hopefully a better fit"
3.0,Shorts fit in the waist but tight in the crotch area. Maybe get one size larger than normal.
3.0,I returned the product because the paint was chipping and there was discoloration on one of the areas where the lens sit.  Loved the look and the frame itself but the specs of paint coming off would have not been good over time.  Waiting on my refund.
3.0,"As stated, these dresses are sized somewhat differently. There is a nice stretch to the material, so you do  have some leeway, it just depends a little on how you like your clothes to fit. Going up one size is a good rule of thumb. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the tie around the neck of this dress. It looked much nicer in the photo than it does in person. The fabric was only one-sided so it did not look as niceas it might have with a better quality tie."
3.0,Ordered a Large since size chart by seller stated size L is close to 12/14 which is my size on average. Extremely tight and hug all the wrong areas and will unfortunately be returning. Order a size up if you want a loose fit or one that doesn’t show all your curves
3.0,Runs really small. Had to return this item twice and order two sizes up for my grandmother. She wears a medium and I had to order an extra large. Hopefully that fits.
3.0,"Gave it three stars because my 4 year old loves them. But the screen prints are stiff and do not hold up well to washing. After one wear and two washes the ariel print is already fading in spots. At over $8 per shirt, I would expect better."
3.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, and perfect for s night out.  It definitely dresses up my Friday night jeans"
3.0,Es de muy mala calidad la tela. Se be muy transparente cuando uno se lo pone.
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because it appears decent quality however I'm returning it because the face is the size of a nickel. I prefer a larger face
3.0,"There were some finishing problems with lots of strings hanging, Hope it doesn't unravel.  Otherwise it is very pretty."
3.0,"Bought size 0: was closer to 00 rendering them useless to me. Other than that, really nice plugs, really good value, I just wish I could use them."
3.0,Clasp broke day after Christmas. He was a very sad little boy 😩
3.0,"The ratchet mechanism itself is great and the belt is great.  The end that bites however tends to pull out after a couple of weeks, therefore causing me to continually trim off the bite end to a fresh section of belt.  As a larger person my belt is definitely subjected to more strain than a smaller person, but design improvements could be made."
3.0,They fit well enough. They worked on the touchscreen. But when I cleared the snow off my car they quickly became soaked and they don't dry out easily.  I put them in the pocket of my coat after I got inside. They were still cold and wet days later.  I need to get something more heavy duty for the Michigan winter.
3.0,"I received this product with a discount in exchange of my honest review. This is so far one of the best prints and designs I have had for this summer in dresses. Great and modern, but poor quality, runs small for curved S size and not well sewed. I have mixture opinion since is great in appearance but poor in quality."
3.0,"The 2XL fits like an L. I look like a sausage in this. I look like I was poured in and forgot the say when.<br />Other than that, it seems quite nice."
3.0,"made in china but still decent quality.  didn't notice any chemical smells.  I wore them without washing first.  If you don't wanna show off much of ur thighs, these are the shorts for you."
3.0,Do not last
3.0,"This Yozly tie dye nightgown looks like cotton candy (white, pink and blue). The design is like a v-neck oversized t-shirt, but it is kind of fitted. That’s my biggest complaint, it seems to run small. The length stops mid-thigh. I like my nightgowns to be oversized, so would have preferred this nightie to be bigger. And since this fabric is 100% cotton, it might shrink after washing which is why I would also recommend that you hang dry after machine washing."
3.0,"Cute, comfortable and true to size, but kind of looks like a nightgown in my opinion. Just ok."
3.0,Sleeves are perfect but torso is so long and also wide.  Doesn't seem proportionate at all
3.0,"Did not fit right at all. Loose at waist, too tight on thighs. Returned"
3.0,Looks like pic but fits small so not true to size!
3.0,"I've got white quartz for my 9 year old, who loved it. Unfortunately the chain broke on the 2nd day."
3.0,"It practically fell to my ankles! But I'm 4'11 so it's probably to be expected. The material was good and it seemed to be of good quality. The material was stretchy, which is a good feature if you need some room breathe. Unfortunately, it was a little too stretchy for me. It looked rather baggy than form-fitting as in the product images. As a result, I ended up returning this item."
3.0,"I love the design, but the tank top itself fits a little weird. I have a lot of room in the back between my neck and shoulders, where it should be tight."
3.0,Snug and not super forgiving
3.0,"I am going to return, it very narrow for my head and either I wear it all the way in the middle part won't touch my nose. It could be my head size bigger than the regular person, but I am not feel comfortable if I wear it for more than 30 minutes. However, the shade very good, it protect my eyes over the sun light."
3.0,It works well and for the most part is well made. My one gripe is the air intake valve leaks before you put in the stopper. Given the price they should use the valve that many pool toys use that close up after inflation and doesn't lose air as you are trying to put in the stopper (plug?).
3.0,It was super cute but it broke in 2 days 🙁 but could easily be repaired with hot glue
3.0,"This has little metal stick on the side. They come out, not designed to but they do."
3.0,"This necklace is really a cool design and seems well made and sturdy. I was bummed that it was far more “blingy” than expected and not subtle enough to wear frequently. With the right outfit and occasion, this would be a great option though!"
3.0,I normally do really well with thong sandals but these sandals tend to hurt between my toes.  They are also super loud.  Haha!  People at work can hear me coming from a mile away.  (that wouldn't make me not wear them though)  They are cute and can be worn with just about anything so it is nice that they are versatile. I just have to take them off a lot so they don't hurt between my toes.
3.0,Didn't care for the fabric or the fit.  Not flattering on an apple body.  Returned.
3.0,"I ordered up a size, and it was still pretty tight."
3.0,"The 1st (big dipper) It's a beautiful delicate piece of jewelry, but totally useless, does not stay in place keeps falling down, very sharp as well. The other 2 are much better."
3.0,Very weird size..medium is too big and small is too small..
3.0,"This is an ""ok"" t-shirt. You get what you pay for. Ordered it as a gag t-shirt, and it's exactly as expected. Thin material, a size too small so please order a size larger than you need. Otherwise, I can't complain. Came on time and is what they advertised."
3.0,"Really cute and great size to fit a notebook in still, but the straps constantly slide down."
3.0,Looks great on my neck
3.0,its somewhat small..
3.0,The red of the glasses is super opaque. Everything you see will be red!
3.0,These would be great for under ski pants or for cross-country skiing. They are a bit tight for a large. The navy color is true to what you would expect. It would be better if the pockets were zippered.
3.0,Might work well for some glasses but not for Ray Ban Wayfarers.  Too tight a fit and ultimately they broke after about a week.  Had to lube up the glasses to get these to slide on.
3.0,Love the fit and color. Very comfortable but they have a weird smell I can’t get rid of no matter how many times I wash them.
3.0,"I Like the skirt and fabric as well as the length.  Waist needed a hook & eye which I added. This is an obvious Metric measured skirt.  Had the skirt been made using the imperial system, it would have fit better."
3.0,It fitted kinda off center. But i adjust it and it fits okay now.
3.0,Deft go one size bigger. Color changes as it stretches.
3.0,"This was a super cute shirt in the photo, very boho and the fabric was the same but the fit of the shirt was very different. Instead of looking cute I looked like I was a peasant farmer which was a little disappointing"
3.0,These run way too large.
3.0,"Seemed like flimsy and cheap material. Also a LOT smaller than I thought it was going to be. My &#34;package&#34; didn't quite fit in there, but I am &#34;above average&#34; compared to most men."
3.0,"It's very cute and I love how it looks, however it starts to wear down very easily and the bear keeps falling off. Last night I was out for dinner, and the strap finally snapped off. Whatever is broken is easily fixed after a minute or two, but it definitely gets tedious after awhile. I only had this bag for a week and it's already wearing down so much."
3.0,More the length of a shirt/tunic than a dress.
3.0,So I bought these because I needed some new comfy pants for around the house and they were really great.. at first.. They fit really well & they're seriously so soft but I've had them less than a month and I already need to sew them! Kinda disappointing.. I was really loving them! I guess I can only wear them occasionally🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,I ordered the 0-6 month size for my 4 month old who is on the smaller side.  The bloomer is as it looks online but the tag reads x-small and it is definielty X-SMALL!
3.0,Ordered months ago and never got them so company was great and refunded money once last delivery date passed. Checked mail today and had to let it be known that they did finally arrive! I'm happy they did eventually get here and are cute. The chains are very long which is nice but had to give 3 🌟 for how long it took and they are kinda hard to open. But thank you and for the price they're worth it.
3.0,"I had to return these because the pants were too tight in the hips/thighs. I don't even have that big of a butt, so I'd say size up if you have anything going on back there. The material on these are amazing, I wish they had extended sizes so I could wear them."
3.0,"This suit does not fit well, chokes me when I sit, arms are restricted when trying to extend both arms forward, really tight in the crotch also. Feels like it's gonna rip when I move certain ways and can't bend over fully at all"
3.0,Nothing like the description or pictures.
3.0,Not need it
3.0,So remarkably nice looking...<br />Although must be REALLY REALLY made 4 people that have not shaved cuz these are Still itchy...ugh<br />Even after so many washings.
3.0,It’s cute but it really hurt my ears.
3.0,"not what picture looks like, no open back, disappointed."
3.0,Son loves the print but they shrank into capris after first wash and dry. He still wears them.
3.0,It’s a pretty dress but unfortunately will have to return. I’m only about 4’10.7” and weigh around 107 and the Small (smallest size provided) was lose on me ):
3.0,Do not put these in the dryer.
3.0,"Runs extremely small.  However, I ordered either 3 or 4 sizes bigger because I read the other reviews so the bigger sized product did fit me."
3.0,Tres bon produits quand même mais il manque quelques choses il faut penser a livrer en Haiti
3.0,"I love the dress, but the material is very thin and almost see through. You will need to wear something underneath this dress. Fits as expected though."
3.0,Steal tied too tightly. I couldn't get it undone to wear.
3.0,"I really like this top but I usually wear an adult medium and I ordered a large so it would fit a little bit looser.  It's so small I can't even put it on.  I do like the top so I'll order a larger size, but now I have to deal with the hassle of returning and reordering. It would be nice if the size chart was updated to be more accurate."
3.0,"I purchased this watch and have not wore it. It's for work. It looks good, but the band looks like fake leather. I exspect the band to break. After all what can you exspect from a thirty dollar Chinese watch."
3.0,"They feel wonderful on my feet but after wearing them just twice, I'm finding little purple rubber circles on the floors. It wasn't until the third one that I realized the socks were losing their grips. Surprising for Dr. Scholl's. Other than that, they fit well. I don't know what will happen once I wash them..."
3.0,These beautiful even though they're very inexpensive they sparkle amazing don't know about the durability yet
3.0,I had large and... it’s a large but for skinny person. Runs super small
3.0,I bought these before but they were of better material. These feel almost polyester-like. Provides almost no sweat absorbsion.
3.0,The color isn't what you see in the pic but over all it got the job done needed it for a dance class. I wouldn't buy it gain though
3.0,Color is lighter than picture. Overall doesn't look like pictured. Very shiny sheen to it.
3.0,looks cgood
3.0,"This wasn't what I had expected, but I'm trying to make it work. I wear a 38 band and because of the other comments/reviews, I ordered an XL which was a bad idea as it is WAY too long and overlaps in the back. The material is good quality and thick, which is a positive. I'm going to alter it myself and add some velcro to the back &amp; hopefully this will improve the usefulness..."
3.0,Very small. Can’t even get it and they only have 1 size.<br />Material is very good
3.0,A little too compact to use for a family. Fine for one person.
3.0,I know the description says thin hoodie; however my husband has tshirts thicker than this. This is not for warmth at all.
3.0,"The product is adorable, but when it came, one of the wings was not attached. Thankfully, when it fell out of the bag, I saw where the ring that attaches it landed, or it would have been a lost cause. I was able to fix it in less than a minute with a pair of pliers, and it is absolutely adorable now, but I feel like it should have been put together better."
3.0,"The lining is too short, only about to the waist."
3.0,Eh - reminds me of something you would get at Forever 21. Its a cheap shoe but comfortable. I've only worn them once and the front is already tearing. I would return them if I hadn't already worn them. The elastic isn't too tight which is nice but tight enough that the shoes don't flop about.
3.0,"This dress was very pretty I was sad that it did not fit. It is definitely not made for someone with a larger bust but still super cute nonetheless! Decent material and not see through, however you would need thin undergarments to make sure no undie lines showed."
3.0,Super cute top. Just wish it was a little longer. Can’t complain too much for the price though.
3.0,"I know my own measurements.  I’m not terribly vain and I hate to waste time and resources. Coolibar makes lovely products that across the board— the leggings, the pullover dress, the culottes— were all at least a size too big. I actually rechecked both my own measurements (they hadn’t changed) and the size chart (also, not changed). As a formerly red-headed (think Pippi Longstocking) still freckled person who grew up in sunny places before the advent of actual sunscreen (I was excited about SPF 8 when I was 13 and we were stationed in Hawaii), I truly value these products. Please get real with the size charts so it’s easier to buy them!"
3.0,Its ok but the material is hot and hard to breath through. My kids don't like them at all so I personally wanted my money on them... they like the soft cloth face masks
3.0,The black one is great but the white and black is not very elastic.  It’s so small with no give that I gave it to my friends little girl.
3.0,Showed wear and tear quickly. Barely made it 3 months before fabric was unattached enough daughter couldn't wear them anymore.
3.0,Too big. Order size smaller
3.0,It wasnt big enough and the heart wasnt screw on so i had to pop it off and glue it onto another bar
3.0,Sadly this did not fit my husband's watch although stated as it should fit his Fenix6.
3.0,"The skirt is short so if you have long legs, keep that in mind. Also it runs a bit small."
3.0,Thin and one was ripped when I got it. But my kids love them
3.0,"There was a hole n the right pocket, it took a long time to come in."
3.0,The shirt is o.k. it does run small I bought a size larger than I usually wear and it was still small<br />and it took like almost 2 months to receive
3.0,"Probably would have given five stars, but I did not realize the material is just like sweatpants  So, more casual and cheaper looking than I would have liked. Will keep though. They are comfortable ..... I just won't be wearing them socially.  Probably around the house and garden and biking."
3.0,It's missing New Zealand.
3.0,The watch is a choice for the price!
3.0,The girl in the photo must be 5 foot tall. I'm 5'7 and it was way to short. It was so cute but I ended up giving it to my petite aunt.
3.0,"Loved this outfit, it was super cute. The bows on the sucker sticks fell off within seconds of my daughter trying it on. They were just hot glued but the shirt was cute even without them."
3.0,"This shoe was mostly comfortable, but I had two issues with it. 1) it was a little too unattractive for me - it just looked too utilitarian and not stylish. 2) the bottom of the shoe is a strange material that made the soles of my feet very sweaty, which was unpleasant. I also had to assume that that level of sweatiness would eventually make them stinky, so there are going back."
3.0,"I am 5'3' and the length is perfect for me with the foldover. Washed them and they shrank very little in length and not at all at the waist. Ordered and XL because the were out of L, which is my size, so of coarse the are a little big. They are very comfy and I do like them. A little pricey though."
3.0,"This dress is very nicely made, and the cut and styling is very flattering... but it runs almost ridiculously small. I ordered it in a size XXL, which should have fit me fine, if not a bit loosely, but when I pulled this from the packaging, it was clear that, at best, this is a large.<br /><br />Very disappointing, because this is a really cute dress, and would look great in the workplace, without being frumpy. If only the sizing were accurate..."
3.0,"The item itself was great, I loved it. It was exactly as the page says it is. Unfortunately I found it difficult to understand the proper size of the glasses from just the page, so when they arrived I found out they were just a bit too small for the smallest and a bit too big for the medium. That’s just me, I would prefer if the page gave a reference as to how big the glasses are beyond just a measurement.<br />I would recommend the product to anyone who needs or wants them, but I would also recommend you do your research for your proper size"
3.0,This dress looked cheap and the material was horrible.. The side of the dress was unevenly sewn and fit terribly I am 5'1 and weigh 189 lbs curvy.. This was not something I would suggest. The design of the dress fades away as it stretches (iff u know what I mean) If you are not slim or tall dont get this. On some one small I would guess it looks better. Also the splits on the sides were not the same and were unraveling.
3.0,"I bought this cap in two different patterns. They’re super cute, nice size and fits all of my hair and or braids in it with ease. But after just an hour or so my ears are usually screaming from discomfort. I usually have to switch back and forth with the cap over and behind my ear because of it which sucks."
3.0,"The sweatshirt is just trim - no lining, not wax coated, so really - just a long sleeved shirt.  It washed ok but the size is a little tight and can't be worn over a heavy sweater."
3.0,"I liked the price of these bras so I tried them. They were good at first and did the job, but after a few washes, which must be done a lot, they got balled up and the pads kept falling out. They just got flimsy way too fast."
3.0,"El material , pero esta bonita , no buen algodón"
3.0,It was small and tight
3.0,(3.5)<br />These are cute. They are strands of different colored wax rope braided together at the ends. They are adjustable. It says they are anklets but they would also make decent looking summer bracelets if that's what you wanted to do with them. They are all different colors so you could wear more than one at a time.<br />I think the price may be just a little high for these but you do get 6. I'm on the fence about it so you'll have to decide that one I suppose. They are very pretty and the handmade aspect is a plus.
3.0,"Was ok, the grey camo was cool, but the shirt was too short keeps riding up on my stomach. Having to pull it down all day is, yeah.... maybe I’ll safety pin it to my jeans lol<br />6’0” 185 bought a large (normal for me)"
3.0,"Bag looks like what is advertised and large in size (which is excellent) however material is not great. Handles are not sturdy, they bend easily and tear at base. Bag came with a white mark on front. But I do carry it to work and it looks nice"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:bf50ebb7fd987185de1a886d579ab91c]] Ok but Don’t expect a mirror replica with this belt. It’s ok for price but the buckle isn’t attached the way the original belt is attached. As long as you don’t see it up close you should be ok. The GG’s came somewhat stained with a pen like bluish blackish paint so that’s a dead giveaway and the belt runs small. I’m a size 10-11 in jeans and 5’11 height. The size I ordered should’ve been true to size.
3.0,"They are good, but it is a bit uncomfortable"
3.0,These pants were super cute but from the photo they looked like actually sweatpants but beware they’re extremely thin like bed pants or pajama material.
3.0,"The fabric is comfortable, but not the best quality. I sized up and the top was still too tight to button up. So if you are closer to the next size up than the next size down size up 2 sizes."
3.0,"I bought 2 - one for me, one for my friend, and we got two different necklaces. Same general style, but one was coppery and the other was silver. It is cute enough, but it fits weird on my neck (the accents don't stay flat)."
3.0,The top ( bust part ) is really big compared to rest of suite and no underwire but for price is ok
3.0,"I really like the daisy design, but we weren't able to use it as intended. The opening was not threaded as expected for a charm billed as Pandora-friendly. In fact the opening was too narrow for either the Pandora bracelet the gift recipient owns or the Brighton bracelet I own. My husband was able to enlarge the opening with a Dremel tool to fit the Brighton bracelet, so we did keep the charm. If you are shopping for a Pandora charm, just be forewarned that this one won't work."
3.0,ADJUSTMENT IF LIMITED. THE SLIPPERS DO NOT FEET NARROW FEET WELL
3.0,"soft plastic sides were dingy upon arrival, photo was faded looking upon arrival and original print was definitely not as sharp or bright as product photo. however, the image itself is still cute and i still like my phone case well enough."
3.0,The clasp in the back is not secure at all had to return
3.0,I found the bracelet under other items that I had ordered! I thought that I had never gotten it! It's nice!
3.0,Item is somewhat cheaply made however the price is right. I bought the necklace for a little girl and she was happy with it.
3.0,"Not the highest quality, but it looks cute and does the job!"
3.0,Not the same as custom made orthotics. I feel that thins is why they were painful for me in particular while wearing. I ended up getting custom orthotics at the end of the day.
3.0,I order a size small and they fit perfectly. The only thing I don’t like about these is they are see through. I still wear them tho.
3.0,"Cute top, but the blue dye leaked into the coral trim."
3.0,"The fit is good but the materials are cheap and after the first wash, I can tell they will not last for many more washes. The pocket lining is thin and already broke. It feels like tissue, or the fabric of a surgical hair net. These also took over 5 weeks to arrive. Seller resolved this issue."
3.0,light material but really nice design and colors
3.0,A little awkward to use.  I may cut it down to a smaller size.
3.0,Coloring is a little off for me but sizing was good.
3.0,"I thought the cultured pearl would be smaller and round.  However I do like them, they can be worn with anything."
3.0,Fabric was thinner than I thought
3.0,Looked slightly differentl from the picture
3.0,This is a cute suit but it really needs bra cups in it. It has zero support.
3.0,"The socks are nice and definitely serve their purpose. They don’t go on evenly. It’s difficult to explain. After washing when you slide your feet in, the material doesn’t stay in place. Constantly having to adjust them. Weird"
3.0,"The picture and the way the product is advertised, I thought I was getting 3 holders when I ordered it. It said only one left so I ordered from another seller also. Both came in and I was very disappointed to find out that both were just 1 holder each! So if you order this item, beware, you’re only getting ONE holder, NOT 3 as advertised. Otherwise it looks like a good sturdy item. I put my wine in it, but I haven’t shipped it yet, so we’ll see."
3.0,"So in all these are really nice quality plugs. Only problem is that sizes vary greatly between the sets. The standard flare plugs are massive! I will more than likely give them to a friend and see if she can use them as even the attempt of me putting them in earlier with oil was not happening. The button front silicone ring backs fit but the opalite front falls right through where as the amethyst and ""pink"" fit snuggly and are secure. The tear drops which is what I bought the set for originally, fits in one of my ears and not the other so with very minor stretching they will fit nicely and I love the look! Again these are amazing quality, decently heavy, and very pretty, everyone's ears will take these differently though as the sizing varies."
3.0,"This item is meant to be large; however usually items from &#34;abroad&#34; run small and the chart told me to get a large. Well a large here is like an XL in American. I like the colors. Please note this is irregular, the sides don't hang the same on each side."
3.0,"Pants fit okay, but she we sized up a year and she will grow out of the shirt in two washes"
3.0,"I purchased an XS, which is a bit too close.  I do not like the buttons, they do not compliment the suit, black or a dark grey or silver would have been better."
3.0,Fix small. And it was mash.
3.0,These seem like nice socks but way too big for a woman with a shoe size of 5.  I ordered small. The heel of the sock was up around my ankle.  There was no sizing information on the bag they arrived in so I have no idea if I even received the size I ordered.  Returning.  Disappointed.
3.0,They were to small for me and I usually get and XL and they fit me more like a medium or large.
3.0,Too small. Order 2 sizes up if you’re looking for a flow look
3.0,Material too thin and didn’t was well.
3.0,Larger than expected. Fit a 3 year old and an adult. Only real beg. The goggles are sized for an adults eyes. A child's eyes are spaced the same. See photos.
3.0,It's a little bigger than expected but good quality
3.0,"It is cute, but the ear cuff is on backwards and there is no way to turn it or use the cuff part. It does not stay on ear. Not going to worry about a refund as it was a $4 item so I'll use it as an ornament or some decoration for something else. Too bad that this is not put together correctly. Looks like others have had this issue too."
3.0,"Would like to give this skirt more stars but it is very uncomfortable in the waist.  The style, length, fabric and color are all great but the waist band is quite tight and add to that the fact that it is supposed to come up above your natural waist makes the result quite uncomfortable."
3.0,"I am legally blind and I thought this would be very helpful to me in my day to day life.  It KIND OF helps, but the magnification is pretty weak.  This is good for someone who just needs a little help, but if you really need a great magnifying glass, you might want something a bit more powerful.  Nonetheless, it really is very pretty."
3.0,They're handy except one of them tore for no apparent reason.  Otherwise they will make organizing easier.
3.0,"The shape on this is not nearly as nice as it appears on the model - it’s definitely less structured with the pleats being less defined. Length is above the knee (I’m 5’5”).  For me, the pockets seem to be too far back as well. The color is nice, as shown in the picture I had in my screen. My biggest complaint is that this is beyond wrinkly. It never seems to come out of the wash without being covered in wrinkles, even when I pull it from the still-hot dryer. And the fabric is a pain to iron. It’s cute, but for something that I bought with the intent of being able to throw it on and go, it definitely falls short."
3.0,It does not hook very good and it not what I really expected
3.0,"Pretty, but bigger than I  expectied and one of the tassels unraveled the first time I wore them. The tassels don’t stay fanned out.  They kind of brunch and you have to flatten them out from time to time."
3.0,"Colors are as described, very bright.  Soft socks, pretty thin though - not good for winter.  Not sure if I would purchase again, but I'm not sending them back."
3.0,"They worked well. I can't speak to the durability of the product but for the time I used them, they were good. I eventually opted to buy a new controller(s) after all because my old ones had too many problems."
3.0,"ITS AWESOME. I'm so excited to cosplay Kaneki with this! However, the two grommets holding the eye patch connected to the mask broke as soon as I opened the package. I tried to fix it but I'm not very good at that sort of thing. But it should work for AX this weekend. Sadness that it broke though. It's so cool!!!"
3.0,This shirt is comfortable and kind of stretchy but not baggy.. however the vinyl wording began to come off after one wear & I had to heat apply it back on.
3.0,"It is very well made  I gave 3 to family as gifts and they all loved it. . Im rough though and I’ll wear it 24/7  . I’ll shower with it , swim with it , work out with it , cardio with it , so I went to a leathersmith and had a new leather band put on it that was twice the thickness of the original leather , but that’s just me . I know how I am with things .<br /><br />It’s a perfect gift for anyone as the insignia of St Benedict is truely Catholic based and at the s as me time nonndeniminational"
3.0,"This outfit is really cute, but it’s kind of a mixed bag as far as quality goes.<br /><br />The shirt is nice. It’s nicely made and the fabric is quality as well.<br /><br />The pants are a cute pattern, but the fabric is a very thin nylon and it’s fraying around the seams.<br /><br />While the outfit is cute, I don’t see us actually putting our loved one in it. The top is something I would dress her in during the colder weather, but the pants would not be warm enough. I just don’t see it working out. It’s disappointing.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful to you. If so please take a second and click the thumbs up button below!"
3.0,Will keep it but a 2XX is a 1XL.....
3.0,Nice vest . I ordered a large which I received but it fit like a small. Reordered a XXXL and it fit just fine.
3.0,It’s tight in the tummy if your not thin.
3.0,"The stones stick out of the ring. It's a bit annoying. In the photo, it looks embedded deeper but that's not the case with the ring I received. I did see other reviews that they received the princess cut, however, i did receive the round. I will attach a photo."
3.0,"Like the design of watch, face & band great look, , only problem is the clasp on the mesh band, will not stay closed. On 2 occasions, while walking, clasp just disengaged and just slipped of my wrist with clasp open. Tried adjusting it in different positions on mesh band, still it will not stay closed.  When I tried to just take it off, the clasp would just completely fall of the band. Clasp is not very secure when closed.  I returned watch to Amazon for credit.<br />WTW"
3.0,"If you have boobs of any kind, and are not a hobbit this may not be the dress for you. I'm 5'8"" and have a 40DD chest. I ordered and XL. And I guess it's pretty much true to size. The issue.... the top seam, that's supposed to go under your boobs, unless you are about 4 inches from your shoulder to your ribs, it's gonna cut you right across the chest. Which gives you an amazing silhouette. Like you have no chest or waste. Just neck, shoulders, knees.<br />If you like that look, buy them in every color.<br />Me? I sent it back."
3.0,"I got this for my granddaughter Gabriella because her name can be hard to find sometimes.  However, I didn't receive her name - received ""Megan"" instead.  The necklace seems to be made sturdy for little active girls.  The chain is really connected to the engraved name and is the perfect length."
3.0,"I just got it today and it seems cool, but it reeks of smoke! It's like it was packaged in a dive bar(in the 90s when you could still smoke in there).  It's laying next to a fan in hopes that it will air out before my trip in the morning.  If it still smell this bad when I wake up, it's staying here"
3.0,"Went large on the size ordered because I figured it would be smaller than expected. Quality was about what I expected for the price, of note the white fringe is not as full as pictured. It is about an inch and a half wide and not fluffy as in picture. Take a brush to it and it fluffs up some but not to what it appears to be depicted in the picture."
3.0,This little grey sweater is an old school shrug.  These were popular in the 90’s and it looks like their back.<br />I like the color and it fit for what it is.  It is a bit scratchy and may not be comfortable wearing long term
3.0,If your tall this is probably not for you
3.0,I love the color and all of the compartments but the zipper part broke after a couple of months.
3.0,the posts are really long
3.0,It is pretty but needs to be one stone longer - fits very tightly.
3.0,I like them but wish they were longer.
3.0,"Pretty in person but SO not big hoops like I wanted! Ladies, if you like big hoops like me, this is not what you're looking for."
3.0,Neon Pink…not fuchsia pink. I’ll still keep it but picture is not accurate.
3.0,"Its cute, but a piece of it breaks off every once in a while and it tarnished badly. It is not part of my everyday keychain either. I use it as a spare key to something else that is used sparingly."
3.0,I really like the fit and style of these glasses and they are well made.  I bought them for the transition type lenses for driving.  I am not happy with that aspect of them.  I have a hard telling if they even change.  I expect clearer when in dark areas and darker when im in the sun.  Im in florida so they should work.  MY honest assesment leaves me disapointed and would look for a higher quality on my next purchase.  Its a shame because i really like the style and the fit just not the primary reason i bought them.
3.0,They are pretty but way to small. More sized for a small child
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Still working Vetter than my arvo watches, yet leather seems cheap as or cheaper than theirs. Also the V6 superspeed is ridiculous on a watch lol."
3.0,"I had take off tags before trying, so I'm going to give it to one of my teensy sisters."
3.0,"Super cute, bright colors and washes well.  My kid is small, she's 3 and still can wear 24 month pants. This fits tight and short on her.  It's good quality but due to size we won't get a lot of use, she will outgrow it quickly."
3.0,Its ok Im usually a size 5 I ordered a 6 and it is very snug. Would be good if it was a little more wide. Still very cute
3.0,"It feels like it will pill very easily. I’m not looking forward to washing it.<br /><br />Also, I’m no stranger to wool. I wear lots of itchy wool and cashmere, but this is very scratchy! I do not have sensitive skin."
3.0,Wasn't very soft
3.0,"I was so excited to order this, but it's honestly a bit snug in the chest. I even ordered a size up, and I'll be real with you, I'm only a C cup so it was pretty surprising it fit like this. the rest is fine."
3.0,"Excellent customer service.  I liked it in the picture, however, it looks very feminine in person so I gave it to my wife.  She loves it but it looked ridiculous on me."
3.0,Product would receive 4 plus however the decorative clasps need adjustment on a continuous basis.
3.0,"This bracelet is very pretty, but my niece bent it just trying to put it on her wrist. It is flimsy, as some others reported. I hope it holds up, as it was a gift for her."
3.0,The leo is a leo good quality but sizing chart an d wording is totally off. I ordered a girls medium and got a toddler medium will be returning.  Please read description carefully.
3.0,the whole set-up was pretty cool except the lenses are kind of small I was Oakley made a package like this with the interchangeable lenses in the arms inelastic straps and all that good stuff not bad for 17 bucks though
3.0,already ran out of battery and to change the battery...you have to disassemble the whole thing....not that great
3.0,Too long but decent material.
3.0,"The picture is nicer.  This did not fit well.  It was to small.  I also did not like how the fabric felt, not as soft as I thought.  I did not return it because it looks ok if I do not button it but its also a bit tight on the arms and I really needed to have a long cover up coat.  I am a large frame girl so maybe someone with a smaller frame would have a better fit.  Not worth it.  If you are looking for a velvet jacket I would keep looking."
3.0,"I ordered it for my baby first birthday , not the best quality i like the gold word one on it ."
3.0,"It works, but in a strong wind it still turns inside out.  It was also much heavier and larger than I anticipated."
3.0,"Super cute, just as pictured!<br /><br />Ran small. I'm a US 14, I ordered a XL and it was too small."
3.0,I tried to put the bee on my crocs and it was broken. So sad
3.0,It’s not too bad. I love the ears and the tail. The gloves are too long and the cuffs are too big. I’m not a small person either. I’m 5’5.5” and 190 pounds so I’m surprised any of this was too big for me
3.0,"The material is soft, but the pants have an odd fit. The high waist is so high that it comes almost up to my bra. The waist is snug but the legs are a bit loose not making them ideal for working out. They are better suited for lounging than running."
3.0,Beautiful but cuts into my arm.  Narrower than expected. Does not stay on as I has a small wrist.  Would​ likely work for someone else.
3.0,"Watch looks good, battery died after 1 week; $25 to have new battery installed."
3.0,I ordered 3 of these caps in L / XL.  Two of them were definitely much too small and one that I kept was borderline.  There has been a significant sizing inconsistency  of late.  Very disappointing as I have several other PE caps in the same size and they fit fine. Fortunately PE makes it almost effortless to return items.
3.0,"This is my fifths order. I love them. They don't fade or shrink. The problem  with this  last order is that the size is huge. I order size M  all the time, but these were cut much larger and longer too. Returning and replacing. Three stars is for flaw in sizing."
3.0,Hmm I didn't get the added bracelet but the dress fits and I'm a plus size girl. It's workable
3.0,"I like the shirt but the arm holes were so tight. They should have added some elastic. I’m keeping it but need to modify it in order for the shirt to be comfortable. Otherwise, it’s a very cute shirt."
3.0,"Honestly, the quality is not very good, the fabric is very thin."
3.0,I was a little disappointed. The hearts were misshaped and didn’t lay flat. There were a couple other ones that are off as well. I loved the idea of the silver and rose gold tone but they don’t lay right at all.
3.0,"Not much compression, but they are okay."
3.0,"Very hard to get the backs of, but beautiful!!!"
3.0,Good quality. I took a chance on fitting since it didn't have a size description. Fit a little big on my daughter but worked.
3.0,The lightweight fabric l
3.0,"Compared to the price, it functions well."
3.0,I was so excited to get this set now I'm upset that I can only where the jacket because the pants are way 2 tight they only come up to my thighs but the outfit is well made good medium thick material
3.0,The ramp angle did not offer the needed support. Will return the shoe
3.0,The gold is a tad on the dark and chincy side. The silver version seems nicer lookingf. But now i have another piece of gold Costume Jewelry...
3.0,"Very cute, nice material but WAAYY small. I'm normally a Small or Medium but got this in an XL and still had a hard time putting it on. Keeping it 'cause it does look cute and need a black bra."
3.0,"Ordered and XXL, and had just gotten some other stretch pants from Target in an XXL that ended up being too big...so, in case these ran small, I thought go with the XXL...they are so tight in the waist that I can't wear them. Order at least a size up, I'd say."
3.0,"This is cute, and looks just like the picture but it runs really small. I normally wear a medium, so i ordered a large and it was still too small and I couldnt wear it as a bodysuit."
3.0,Cute but obviously cheap..
3.0,"I really liked the color and fit, very soft. Unfortunately a little thin and kind of see-through when in the light."
3.0,It's a good material for the price but I ordered burgundy color and received red.
3.0,"Works as designed, but with the two strands on each side it has a tendency to get tangled easily in my purse."
3.0,Nice product. Only down side is the screen protector slides a bit but the finger print sensor doesn't work at all. And yes I turned on the touch sensitivity and it still didn't work.
3.0,Material was not what I expected as well as length. Overall fit ok.
3.0,The glasses are comfortable as advertised but the optics are not the best. Seems like there are some variations in the lenses and take some getting used to. Construction and lenses are plastic and do not seem like a originally priced $90 pair of glasses.
3.0,Very low quality!! The side flap opened up and we had to stick with hot glue..
3.0,"I picked up two pairs of these shorts about a year ago for my trail running. They are lightweight and dry quickly. So far, the pockets have held up. I've had problems with other brands where the pockets tear out while I'm running, one time resulting in lost car keys. But these seem to be holding up. I also like that the back right hand pocket is slightly offset closer to the hip, so I'm not sitting directly on my wallet when I ride my bike or drive my car.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the sizing is unreliable. I had size 34 for my first two pairs, and they fit perfectly. So I ordered two more pairs in size 34, but they are quite a bit too big. They are so big, I need to return them for a smaller size. Even with the belt, the fabric gets all bunched up when the belt is tightened to my actual size.<br /><br />These are the exact same brand, style, and size. Why are they so different? Now I need to waste time packing them up and driving them to a UPS store to return. Sizing is not an unknown. Waist size can be measured. Fabric can be measured to match. This is just sloppy manufacturing."
3.0,"Good material and look, but the buttons do jingle when moving. I fixed it using an adhesive, but it an extra tedious step."
3.0,"This is a decent utility jacket for fall or winter in a warm climate. The material has a bit of stretch to it, making it very comfortable, and it looks great thanks to the drawstring at the waist. While it won't provide true warmth if you're in a cold climate, it does a decent job at keeping the wind out and is comfortable in 50-60 degree temperatures with a t-shirt underneath. With a thick sweater, this may be fine for the 35-45 range.<br /><br />As for construction, this is on the lower end of what I would expect for a jacket in this price range ($39.99). The stitching is a bit sloppy with some poorly done seams, loose threads, and some stitching coming undone on the interior. Unfortunately, I don't expect this to last more than one or two seasons.<br /><br />The fit on this seems to be true to size. I ordered a size up to accommodate a sweater in colder weather and it fits me as it should. Thanks to the drawstring waist, I was able to do this without it looking sloppy and the extra length in the sleeves and body is always a plus. I would recommend sizing according to how you intend on layering, or not, underneath it.<br /><br />Finally, I did want to note that I was very disappointed to realize that the top two zippered pockets on the bust aren't functional. They are just decorative zippers sewn onto the jacket. I would have much preferred the functionality of having extra pockets.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay jacket that may not last for more than a season. The stitching is poorly done and some of it is already coming undone. However, the fit is true to size and the material is very comfortable. However, I would recommend buying this on sale or skipping this one for a more durable alternative (with hopefully more pockets!)."
3.0,The light tan bag I received is far from the color shown in the photo.  It looks more like cream than tan and does not match my shoes.  Very disappointed with purchase.
3.0,Quality is good. Three stars because one of the sleeves had a rogue print on it. Like it had two right sleeves...so there is a random part of a fire engine on the back of the left sleeve. It was fine enough to keep and not hassle returning. But bummed of the quality because it was a birthday gift.
3.0,"The photo attached is how it arrived in the package, the two items were meat and folded, the H2H, in a ball. Still deciding if I will return or not, must had been prior to Amazon."
3.0,"except for the bow, seriously i dont see these ffitting even the most petite person i know.<br />these would fit a childs pinky finger., but they are cute."
3.0,"these say 10 but they are very tight.  recommend getting at least one size bigger.  i don’t have particularly wide feet, wear vans or converse most is the time."
3.0,"You get what you pay for with this. The ends are supposed to be lace, but they are a little frayed. We had 7 bridesmaids order this for a wedding, and every robe was a slightly different color even though we ordered the same color. If you order in bulk beware that color will vary!"
3.0,"Not as pictured,  I'm 5'6 and this skirt was significantly shorter than I expected. it reaches my ankles, my feet are completely exposed which ruins the mermaid effect. The reviews said to size up, I wear a large (10-12) in women's clothes and I am very bottom-heavy so I ordered an XL. It is slightly big, I could have gotten away with ordering a large. the quality is very thin and scratchy but if you wear pants under it that should help. Overall you get what you pay for and this would work well for someone below average height, I however will have to find another alternative before Halloween."
3.0,Good quality but they sew right down the middle which messed up the quote. Completely defeats the purpose. I would have loved it if not for that.
3.0,It was nice but hard to assemble.
3.0,they are very wide
3.0,"Not sure if these are legit as the logo on them looks poorly sewn. It hardly looks like a polo person on a horse. The materials feel good enough, but they ran small for my feet which are average for a male ~ size 10 shoe."
3.0,Not bad I think it’s a good ring just a little thin
3.0,"This is a nice top except the two strings on the top are why too big so it doesn't really look good, had to have them cut and redone to fix correctly."
3.0,"Size is off, way small, and wow this is one VIVID color dress!"
3.0,Good product and super cute only thing is one pair didn’t un  screw
3.0,theyre very pretty just dissapointed that they are more delicate and smaller than I expected. overall theyre nice
3.0,Reasonable for the price but already turning color.
3.0,"Fits really well and is very cute! the strings are long, and the elastic is a little stiff. very high rising"
3.0,"I love the color, wasn't crazy about the heel, they were thicker then they looked online. I ordered a half size bigger so my heel wouldn't hang over the back of the shoe but that made the shoes larger elsewhere, there was a lot of room for my feet to move around."
3.0,Too expensive for the quality
3.0,"I ordered a 4T. Upon arrival, the tag said 3yr-4yr. Had I known that before ordering, I would have ordered the next size up. My daughter loved the dress, so we kept it and will just wear it with pants."
3.0,Great product for price. Color chipped off band easily. Wish screen was brighter. Get lots of compliments.
3.0,"Runs small, kid complaints that it bites"
3.0,"I needed exactly 12 pair for my kids, but 2 arrived with deep scratches in the lenses making them unusable. I had to scramble to find two more pair that were similar so that everyone would have a pair."
3.0,"This is cute but I can't wear it. It's way to big and hangs down too far. Also the stone isn't quite as turquoise as the picture shows, it's a little greener than the picture. If it was smaller I would definitely wear it. I'm pretty bummed that I cant."
3.0,"Fabric was okay but the fit wasn't nice, looked different from picture."
3.0,Couldn't figure out how to use it
3.0,"These were not what I was expecting. First the choir is not black AT ALL! I would describe the onix black as more of a midnight blue. Second the sole of the shoe is VERY narrow. Felt like half of the bottom of my foot was exposed. Do not wear these out on city streets, definitely for light traffic or indoor use only."
3.0,No se... No es como lo esperaba.. No es como se ve en la foto. Son algo anchos.. Aunque por el precio que pague esta bien. 9$
3.0,Actually I think I could’ve took in a size smaller but I’m comfortable with the XL I’m in between Fibar if you want to really take take the large but it’s pretty much true to size
3.0,One side is missing the center thing. I’ll have to return and reorder.
3.0,Too small to wear as full-length pants. I will probably cuff them up to resemble a clam-digger type pant. The next size up is a 6Long and my 5 year old is very tiny. Shirt is rather small as well.
3.0,Smallest that I expected
3.0,"I have some Foot Zen socks that I really love. They are extremely well padded, and stretch a whole lot. This really helps me with golf shoes and &#34;problem&#34; feet. They're extremely comfortable.<br /><br />These, however, are a different model. Nothing wrong with them, if that's what you want. Not a lot of padding, and not a lot of stretch. In fact, they don't work well on my 10.5m feet. By the time I get them over my heels and in shoes, they are bending my toes back.<br /><br />So, I returned these and am going for the specifically &#34;padded&#34; version of the socks."
3.0,I purchased the largest size available for my boyfriend who wears a size 13 but the slipper was unfortunately a little small.
3.0,The fit was smaller than expected. I understand it’s a sports fit like exercising gear but this was not what my other similar tops fit like. Almost fit like youth sizing.
3.0,"Received the wrong dress, too close to needing it to exchange. The dress is nice and soft just not what I expected"
3.0,But the back became lose pretty fast
3.0,"Love the color.<br />The material is not as sturdy as my 4 other OR radar pocket caps, it has no loop in the back to hang it, and I'm not sure if it's going to be better for the hot summer weather....<br />I might decide to just return it.  Don't know if this has anything to do with it but it was made in Vietnam, and the others in China."
3.0,It was wonderful first day I wore them I washed it an it fell apart but before that I was getting ready to order a lot of them boy I’m disappointed
3.0,"Given the low price, not surprising that the hem and sleeves are sewn by machine (Tshirt-like double seam) despite the somewhat formal style.  The fabric is suitably thick (like stretch pants) but still soft. Snug fitting, shows bra lines.  Seems like the dress would shed wrinkles easily.  Did not wash before returning but you would need to before wearing because of slightly odd smell. May be a good bargain if you need to build a professional wardrobe quickly, but I will spend more next time."
3.0,Super soft and seems very well made. Plus size is definitely not plus size. Runs small. The plus size is closer to a normal one size fits most.
3.0,I order medium and it was big
3.0,The ball that kept the charm on fell off and was lost within a couple weeks of purchase.
3.0,Bigger than normal Nike. No support
3.0,"Too short - not like on the picture - above my knees. And neck line is too wide open, but I like it anyway -the fabric is light and sleeves alway good to have."
3.0,"Just opened them today, hoping to wear them and the arrived broken :(<br />The little stick that goes through your ear was bet to the side and falling off :(<br />I wrote the seller and they offered to send new ones. Because I live outside of the us I ended up getting a refund.<br />The earrings themselves are beautiful"
3.0,Not as long as picture
3.0,"Runs tight if you have ample bosom and short and I'm 5'5"". Great for petite person."
3.0,"I sometimes wear an XL and sometimes a XXL. To be safe, I ordered and received a XXL. I does not close in the front and is tight across the shoulders. I let someone who wears a medium try it on and it's only slightly too large. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO SIZE THEIR PRODUCTS CORRECTLY. I'm so sick of Amazon letting them get away with this ridiculous false sizing. They need to put a button that allows us to include or eliminate from searched all slim fit, skinny, and Asian sized clothing. It's such a waste of time."
3.0,Nice socks but smaller than advertised.
3.0,I bought this dress to wear for my birthday. It arrived quickly but upon opening found the dress to be defective. It has several faded or rubbed spots on the chest area. I washed it in hopes that it was just pressed from the store tag but it was not unfortunately. It’s unwearable and a complete loss.
3.0,I would rate it 3 stars since it's not properly tailored. Material is cheap. Macys still my fav store when it comes to sale !
3.0,"I wanted a nude color  and this had a great price. Arrived in good time, but XL size did not fit me. This was also too long for me as I have a short leg.  For most people I think this would work good."
3.0,"I like the material and the fit, but the length is a good 3"" shorter than the product description claims (40"" for size L).  With the dress this short I'm not wild about the slit in the front.  The pockets are in front, not the sides, so putting anything in the pockets gives you a little bulge in front."
3.0,I would go two sizes up! The camel toe is more noticeable in solid colors as well!
3.0,Camera quality is dismal at best.  After a few hours of flying the drone immediately takes off in one direction.
3.0,"This is a good looking,yet very cheap"
3.0,Inconsistent sizes. I also own this same sweatshirt in the same size in another color and it is much bigger. Weird.
3.0,"I ordered a 16 regular, my usual size. When I tried it on it felt just a little snug in the middle. I set it up for return and ordered the next size up, a 16 womens. When it came it was huge.  There were big darts in the bust line that were not in the sixteen. Just that one size and I’d need a bra and something to fill it with a cup three sizes up. There has to be something in the middle. Disappointed because otherwise I really like the shirt a lot. Nicely made with nice fabric."
3.0,Very cute but way smaller than what I thought.
3.0,I think this is adorable but it is way big. I'm 5'4&#34; and it swallowed me up. So I had to return it.
3.0,"They look exactly like the images provided. However, the gems inside the charms tend to fall out easily. But they do provide extra to replace them, but you can’t walk for more than a day before you notice another stone is missing."
3.0,"Doesn't seem to really change the shine on much that I have tried it on. I think maybe each metal needs it's own &#34;made for&#34; cleaning cloth, much like silver. Not expensive so you can check it out on your own."
3.0,"Way. Way. Way. Larger fit. Yikes. Whereas others were way. way. way. way smaller fit. Depends on the shoe you buy from them.<br /><br />And they smell, awful. AWFUL. They even put in sachets of 'deoderizing' things like lemon or 'rose (that one made me nearly gag)' they only intermix with the REALLY awful smell. The POWERFUL smell of chemicals. It is not something that will air out. I had the pair for quite a while, even put them in my garage with the DOOR OPEN. Nope. NOPE."
3.0,Colors and size are great. Fabric is very thin and wrinkles after being washed and dried.
3.0,It wrinkles to easily
3.0,I LOVE the way this watch looks and fits. My only complaint is that the hour and minute hands blend in with the background so sometimes I have to turn my wrist to get the right angle to be able to see what time it actually is.
3.0,"nice band, but requires special tools to size"
3.0,"I love the look , but it runs small."
3.0,They are really comfy! I love the material! The only thing that I don’t like about them is that they are so stretchy they tend to ride up out the top of the back of your pants!
3.0,"This watch cost me $39.99. It looks good but it's very light and feels like it cost exactly $39.99.<br />Overall I'm not mad at the purchase, But if you're looking for quality..keep looking."
3.0,"Beautiful Rosewood Color; however this item is Plastic.<br />Very cheap and classless.<br /><br />I received my item late, and though I'll be on the hunt for a more beautiful, sustainable Buddha Bunch; I have no problem wearing this one until I'm able to make the trade.<br /><br />Cheap Price/Cheap Item"
3.0,It's a cute little bag but it has a very hard body - almost plastic like.  I knew it was supposed to be faux leather but I didn't expect it to be so hard.  But it should suffice for just a small cross-body for running errands in my jeans
3.0,"Mine don't have the swirled wire on them like the picture shows now. (I think that might have been a change after I ordered them; had them a while.) &#34;Clear&#34; is a bit misleading. Mine look a bit yellow, but fortunately I prefer something a bit on the warmer side."
3.0,"very beautiful however I don't have the right body type for this dress.  This is for a taller person, I am only 5'3&#34; so the back is too long meaning the back zipper puckers which doesn't allow the neckline to lay flat.  It also has no stretch to the fabric at all so sitting is a bit uncomfortable.  Those with longer torsos and slender hips/thighs, will fit this style nicely.  Very disappointed it didn't work."
3.0,"I really like the fit!  The zipper is less than smooth, more like annoying.  I almost returned it, and may eventually for a warranty fix."
3.0,"Cute, but poorly made."
3.0,Super cute! A little hard to get into.
3.0,No idea why it smells the way it does. Way more bright red then dark red like in the picture. It's a nice material but slightly let down overall
3.0,I love the size of the bag but the quality is lacking a bit.
3.0,This romper was just ok...it was sooo small. I'm usually a 1x-2x however I ordered 3x and it was still TINY. I need this in a bigger size for sure….Also it came with a hole. Yikes. I’ll be returning.
3.0,"These socks are small. I wear 10EE in women's shoes, and the heel in the sock doesn't quite cover my heel. This is before the socks have been washed. I'm assuming they will shrink during washing.<br /><br />The patterns are very attractive. At first look, these socks look well made. However, there were several loose threads. As I was removing these threads, I came across some that were attached to the sock. I don't know how this affect the durability of the sock.<br /><br />The yarns used for the pattern are loose on the inside of the side. This may cause snagging."
3.0,"I ordered these for my daughter and they fit her perfectly the only issue I have is that it says it has pockets but there are none, it's only a tiny hidden pocket in the waist. If you're looking for a isn't with pockets these aren't the ones you want. Just a little frustrated with that statement."
3.0,"These are a little bigger than ones I've ordered in the past which means they don't really cling to your face so much as loosely lay on top, meaning they slip down a lot especially with head movement like looking up or turning your head.<br /><br />I do like them though, not hard to breathe through, the material is soft, disappointed the rainbow print wraps the whole way around the mask instead of just one side which means when wearing it it doesn't look like a full rainbow because only two or three colors show up at a time looks more like a gradient/tye dye mask rather than rainbow drip. Such is life I guess."
3.0,Much smaller than expected .
3.0,It fit alright. Wish it were a bit more lose at the bottom (snap part)
3.0,They are not very clear. They impact my ability to clearly view various things while I'm driving or walking.  It seems to place an unneeded shadow over what I'm looking at.  They are not as clear as other sun glasses I've purchased.
3.0,It looks like it says mr onederfw
3.0,Color is not as shown in picture. Quality is fair for the price.
3.0,"This dress was lovely, but too small. The off shoulder straps where also a bit tight"
3.0,The top has weird seams and the removable pads has weird openings
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and it is too short in the front. Would need to be at least 2"" preferably 3"" longer in the front."
3.0,I liked the color and the design but i wasn't thrilled with the material. It felt a bit itchy. If you are not sensitive to materials its a cute buy but i had to return mine. By the way i am 5'9 145 lb and 34C to help out with sizing. I ordered a medium and it fit fine.
3.0,"It's fine, but the display holder on the base should be attached somehow.  I don't want to use glue, but maybe will try attaching it with 2-sided tape."
3.0,Very soft! Didn’t look good on me though but I will still use them for washing my face etc.
3.0,"I like them, but just a little bigger than I anticipated.  I have gotten compliments on them."
3.0,love the colors it is beautiful but if you are busty please order a size up because it causes the colors to &#34;spread&#34; (stretch) across the bust line which makes it not as flattering
3.0,It didnt come with a chain so that was kinda irritating. But the gf loved it. Tryin to put a picture inside has been a struggle too.
3.0,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. I thought it would be a little bigger then it is. It looks pretty fragile as well so I hope it doesn't come apart. But on a positive note I do like the keychain and I think he will too.
3.0,Very lightweight faux leather..I was expecting a little better quality but it is a nice navy blue
3.0,my 5-year-old is still trying to figure them out
3.0,"It looks like there should be a good shelf to spread the weight out across your palm, but the shelf is kind of small and feels nonexistent as it folds away under pressure.<br />Rubber feels like it will crumble or turn sticky in a couple months. It's soft like the bristles of a rubber/latex basting brush.<br />Clamps have sharp edges. I don't trust the threads with more torque than what barely holds the grips from spinning.<br /><br />Still worth the cheap price. I just don't know why you'd make them with such soft rubber or not extend the plastic sleeve on the inside to support the shelf. It does work as advertised though."
3.0,Runs really short.
3.0,"I ordered the 1.5mm band and it was thinner than other 1.5mm bands I have so I don't feel the description is accurate. It also did not fit true to size for me. I always wear a 4.5 but this one was more snug. I'm debating if I'm going to reorder, but in the 2mm width and if so, I'll definitely go up to a size 5. Also, my band was not stamped with any kind of makers mark or the type of metal or anything."
3.0,Nice no quite what I expected very light weight
3.0,Came with a dead battery but it's OK.
3.0,It’s a cute casual dress that fits as a normal XL should. The material isn’t what I expected and the colors aren’t as bright as pictured.
3.0,not quite what I was expecting
3.0,Top fit great!  Bottoms way too small!
3.0,"I love the way it fits, but the blue bead is not as pictured. I know beads can vary in appearance but it barely had markings and I had like the picture because it made me think of the earth. But mine does not."
3.0,"Don't like it, runs small."
3.0,It served the purpose
3.0,"I ordered the blue-flowered suit and like it; thought I would try this orange suit, the legs looked longer. Quite a different fit and horrors, see right through it.  The style is good but not in the solid colors. As to size I chose the medium instead of my usual small and appreciate the extra room; how a lady with a bust would manage I do not know!"
3.0,"It’s okay, but not quite what I was expecting for the price. Somewhat cheap look to it."
3.0,weird quality but looks nice
3.0,"The shipping was really fast!! This piece looks really cute, its cheap. It isn't rounded like in the picture, but it will do. The cost was around $8 with shipping, I feel I could have gotten a better piece of jewelry from Charming Charlie or maybe Cato for a couple more bucks. I will wear it a few times."
3.0,unfortunately they are too big..
3.0,The stone is pretty. I did notice some color. I like the chain although it is very thin. I did not like the setting and returned it for something else.
3.0,"Was looking for a warm, durable glove---these looked to fit the bill. I thought I ordered women's xl as I have thicker fingers but when rec'd were way too big---finger width good but fingers way too long. Must have been men's XL. Or if unisex, sizing tricky. They are sturdy, warm gloves so was bummed didn't fit and returned. Could keep trying different sizes...."
3.0,Does not look like the product advertised. Still nice.
3.0,"I got this for my 9 year old son who is a size 14/16. I got the biggest size which is 11-13 year old and it fits him barely. He does fit it but after it's washed and dryed, I'm sure it will shrink. It would fit more of a 7-8 year old. My son is tall and thin. I got the dark brown, it is exactly as pictured and came earlier than delivery date! Happy with it, just wish it was bigger but it'll do for family photos"
3.0,The quality is really high however I personally don’t like the fabric type. There are a way better materials for workout shirts.<br />Take it this way: regardless the high quality this shirts are my last options before going to the gym.<br />That means something
3.0,They were ok for the price
3.0,"have worn this sweater for about a week and it is showing those annoying little fuzzy balls all over the yarn (especially on the sleeves).  however, it is cozy, and comfortable so I'll keep it to wear around the house, but it no longer looks good enough for wearing to work."
3.0,"It'd be even better if it had arrived undamaged. When I opened it, the neck between the fin and the head was split halfway through, having been bent in shipment. The post was extremely wobbly, leaving me extremely doubtful as to the sturdiness of the piece. I will be returning this shortly."
3.0,bit narrow in the front (for those with wide feet);had to replace bottom outer sole;cork area warping;very cute but cheaply made
3.0,Only used the ring for 2 weeks and 1 little diamond was out already.
3.0,I liked that this item is hand made but once you ware this item for a while the paint starts to chop away and the beads start to crack.
3.0,Material thinner than expected. Much too long for a shorter person. And the med fits more like a large.
3.0,The necklaces are simple and pretty. We love them. The clasp on the small heart never closed all the way.
3.0,A little smaller than I like
3.0,Order a size larger. These sizes are not USA sizes.
3.0,"Nice coverage, sheer but not too sheer... It is rough material but for the price I like it.  HOWEVER,  it seems the top was stretched out by prior purchaser ... come on Santo and Amazon don't rook your patrons, there are countless places to shop on line!!!!"
3.0,Not the material I thought it would be. Returned it.
3.0,Average product .. strap is definitely not leather  and pins are flimsy. Not worth the money.
3.0,The pockets puff out
3.0,"Beautiful. Unfortunately, one of the earrings came in the package broken from theearring back. Jewelry glue to the rescue."
3.0,These run SUPER small! I bought my usual size and could hardly get them past my knees!
3.0,"For a comfortable flattering fit, size up 2 minimum."
3.0,I really don’t think these socks are wool. They don’t keep my feet any warmer than my regular black socks.
3.0,Pedí talla L y parece XLL .... muy grande
3.0,LOVE the fit of these leggings so much - but the light blue is COMPLETELY see through ):
3.0,I received but missing one cristal.
3.0,They are bigger than I thought they would be.
3.0,Color was more brown then I thought it would be
3.0,They’re okay. Price is phenomenal so I shouldn’t complain.
3.0,"It's a nice dress, but just not for me."
3.0,pretty.....but too painful on the ears!!
3.0,"There's really no tummy control.  There is a wide elastic waistband that, while not uncomfortable, is not particularly flattering as it pulls in at the waist, which without the compression of tummy control just creates a buldge below the band.  It's not physically uncomfortable and since I exercise at home I will continue to use them, it to hard to find afford leggings with pockets not to."
3.0,Very thin material. Not a dress I would want my daughter to wear to any special occasion like a wedding or dinner. The top is see-through so you will need to have your daughter wear a white tank underneath if she's wearing it out. It's more for a play dress-up. I got it for a photo shoot but am going to have her wear a different dress. The fake petals are very bright and there are some blues and greens along w/ what you see pictured. They are loosed around the bottom tulle so must shake it around to fill the bottom skirt. I was thinking of taking out the petals but my daughter likes it and will be wearing it for her ballet class. And the dress I ordered did not come with the bow ribbon. Looks cheaply made so I don't expect it to last long and am afraid of washing it in the washer. Is cute and is slightly above knee length. Daughter is a little over 38&#34; tall and got the 4t (120cm). A size bigger and it would have been to wide for her.
3.0,"I like the style, but but it takes forever to get the wrinkles out. The packing it needs to be improved."
3.0,"I like how the picture looked, but actual product was not well made. Probably won't buy another."
3.0,"A little small.  Need to really stretch them to get the look of the Victorian Era.  I couldn't find anything else at the time.  Colors are great, using the black for theatrical use, the colorful ones keep my heavy long hair off my neck during hot weather.  I like that!"
3.0,Too big for my wrist but pretty. No way to adjust is to fit different wrist sizes.
3.0,Super adorable top in theory that looks better in the picture than it does in person... I was hoping for a versatile top that would look great at work or casually... with a pair of jeans or tights. It was ill fitting and seemed kind of cheaper... I would say order a size up and wear a tank under. It does not flatter the tummy/hip area.
3.0,"These are smaller bands,  probably designed for a lady.  For a man, my wrists are larger so they only fit on the last notch.<br /><br />It fits perfectly with Fitbit Charge 4."
3.0,As a cover over a white tee to wear on Christmas Day.
3.0,It makes me laugh when a watchmaker brags about how scratch resistant their watch is when they're using a mineral crystal LOLLL
3.0,"nice shoe, but runs about 1/2 sz small & is NOT red more a cranberry."
3.0,"The bag is a lot smaller than I thought, it doesn’t hold much but the quality is good"
3.0,"Nice bag but the color doesn't match the photo.  I ordered 3, all were like green."
3.0,The variety
3.0,Fit nicely but it came with white gloves and no socks
3.0,This watch looks decent but not high end
3.0,"This product fits perfectly, is soft and comfortable to wear. I gave it a 3/5 because of the way it came out after the first wash. The red dye bled and the grey part has subtle hints of pink everywhere that I couldn’t remove Also tie the ends of the cowl neck strings. Otherwise, they’ll also come out as well."
3.0,It came deformed.I tried to straighten it out but no luck
3.0,"I don't look like the bright red color, it's too orange looking.  The earrings are looking light-weight, and so far, comfortable."
3.0,"I love the paisley design, I got too little comptrssion"
3.0,"Buyer beware...the smell is really strong. I've had mine for a month and it still stinks. If you are looking for sturdiness, this won't cut it. I like it because it does its job. It's small but holds the necessities:  16 cards, keys, phone, and lipstick."
3.0,"I feel these fit almost too tight, yanno my husband says ""it does cut the circulation kn his legs"" so maybe this is what it's supposed to do. I guess. He wore them for 1hr and had to take them off:("
3.0,Its a nice looking ring and is rather cheap but it came apart.
3.0,Loved the masked but only got one mask still amazing that’s why the low review
3.0,Was really looking forward to the teal color... :(<br />The one that came is yellow... not my color. I can change finger grips but screws not as easily
3.0,Love colors - my adult female face is a bit small so I’m constantly pulling up.  Not elastic enough for me.
3.0,Its a little snug. although I ordered L (usually I wear M/L) but it is pretty snug.
3.0,"The fleece didn’t fit inside the raincoat comfortably. It seemed like the two jackets weren’t made to go together. Separately, they fit fine. Color is nice."
3.0,I bought large but was seemed medium
3.0,I have ordered 2 other pairs of these pants from different sellers and for whatever reason the belt string on these is a little small. I wear a size 34 in mens and compared to the other pants of this style I own the string is barely able to be tied around me. Just beware if you wear more than a size 34 in mens these may or may not fit you unless you add leanth to the belt.
3.0,"I didn't not like these pants. I had a pair of pants I bought from a store. I looked at the tag for brand and size. When I looked it up on Amazon I found this pair as a match. Once I received the pants, it was not what I was expecting and it was way too large. I returned it. Returning it was no hassle and the whole transaction was easy. I gave 3 stars for that reason and because the item material felt like a good material. However, the item... being large aside, I did not like the way the pants fit so opted not to get a new size."
3.0,"Was overall happy with this product. The only problem I had was the heel on my right foot ripped off. I tried to glue it back in twice but it kept falling off. If this problem would get fixed, the product would be worth the money, but not till then.<br />Might be better as dress up boots. just not for ranch work"
3.0,Fair for the price.
3.0,This shirt was not my favorite. It opens way to much for my comfort. Not to mention gets in the way at the gym
3.0,I have skinny feet and the size 12 are a bit tight through the middle.  They will be fine over time but they could have been a little looser over the arch area.  The width is fine.  Update.... they are not lasting very well.  The toe pieces are wearing out and looking scruffy..... wouldn't recommend.
3.0,Item was ok
3.0,"Good item for the price, cozy feel and unique details, though the quality will certainly not last. The size was right on for the waist and chest, but the length is pretty short (falls just at/above the tops of back pockets, barely below belt)."
3.0,I love these but unfortunately I don’t think they’re piercing grade. They often made my nose itch like it was fake. I’ve never ever had an issue with nose rings or earrings so if you’re sensitive stay away!
3.0,"I’m 5’2, more of the thicker athletic build.  167 lbs. Medium size dress was very tight around the thigh and butt area. It does stretch some but not enough. It’s definitely a beautiful dress though"
3.0,Cute top. But did not receive the bottoms !
3.0,Very hard to put on by yourself.
3.0,I usually wear a 3X and decided to get a bigger size from the reviews and I am glad I did. The 5X would barely constitute a size 3X but it's super cute and soft and comfy.
3.0,"I love,love the boots. I bought red my favorite color .would by another color, however i wish they were half size longer.i wear a perfect size 10 .they feel short.very disappointed.I love them so much I wear occasionally."
3.0,"I love this color, but this fit on this top isn’t the best for bustier girls. I had ordered a medium and a large and neither were perfect and I only kept this one in the medium because I liked the color. The arm holes on the large were too big and sat oddly. The medium is a bit tight, but not the absolute worst. For reference I’m a 34DD"
3.0,Poor lock
3.0,It doesn't fit anyone in my family's wrist right it is too big
3.0,Comfortable but short width and length wise for hijab and coverage
3.0,Not as comfortable as Yellowbox shoes I have had in the past.
3.0,"Order a size larger, too small for one son to wear and other son will outgrow it soon which will break his heart. Great fabric and looks great on younger son."
3.0,"I like this dress. It's a little looser in the chest than I would like. I felt like I was constantly readjusting it. But it fits great everywhere else. Next year, I'll just wear a camisole underneath it."
3.0,"The large size fit as expected, but the sleeve length was way too long! 39 inches."
3.0,"Beautiful watch at incredible price ! But it did not look new; had a few minor scratches in case back. I would have kept it, but the fast date forward did not work and band was too tight (and I have a less than average size wrist; never had this issue with a watch). So regretfully I returned this watch."
3.0,"*update*<br />*The I received a reply from the seller. Due to a business trip they weren't able to respond to my messages and have issued me a refund because they are out of stock for my size.*<br /><br />The vest is probably the best you can buy for a super low price. Only problem is you have to be very careful with it. So far I have owned the vest for maybe a month and a half, and here's my experience so far.<br /><br />On the first week and a half the vest ripped in the right armpit area size of the tear was around 2 or 3 inches.<br /><br />On the 4th week the right pocket zipper just disintegrate. I only used that pocket like 6 times total and never put items no bigger then a credit card.<br /><br />Finally on the 6th week the vest stopped working the wires on the button are messed up because if u move them though the inside of the vest it will turn on and u have to have them in a certain position otherwise they will shut off.<br /><br />Overall this is a awesome vest it's cheap, looks good, and has amazing heating with great pad placement. Also it's still pretty warm without the heating pads. Just needs to be more durable."
3.0,"Fit good, but don't like the way it looks."
3.0,"I find that 3X in these pajama bottoms are a little snug.  I like to order 3X’s in pajamas because it gives me a little more room than I need. So if anyone needs a 2X or a 3X, these may not be the correct product for you. But I am wearing them anyway."
3.0,"Look good, but they're really cheap!!!<br />The black frame has begun to bubble up and is flaking off. They won't last more than a few more weeks at this rate, unfortunately.<br />The screws that hold the frame to the sides are always coming loose. I have had to tighten them a few times. The first time I noticed this was because the glasses actually fell off my face... but I was lucky enough to find the screw and put it back together.<br /><br />For the price I'm not unhappy. Just know what you're buying."
3.0,I literally had to take the stitches out and reset so it would fit across my chest.  I normally wear a large and orders a 2xl because of the reviews. Just don’t bother.
3.0,"I love this wallet and would rate it 5 stars except it has been leaving sticky glue residue on some of my cards.  It was somewhat tough to get off some of my cards, so it was rather annoying.  Otherwise, I love it.  Seems like others have the same issue, I may try a different brand next time."
3.0,the arms were way too big for the size of the corset. i’m 5’1 120lbs and the sleeves looked weird hanging off my shoulders so i had to cut and resew them. i love it now that the sleeves fit!
3.0,"It took so long to get the product, I assumed they weren't coming and purchased something else. Product is okay, but wasn't worth the wait."
3.0,Comfy & easy
3.0,Not packaged as pictured.  Received individually packaged.  No gift box.
3.0,I like it but a pain to get into. Wish it just had a zipper on the top instead of flap.
3.0,"I order 3 necklaces, one of them did work"
3.0,This swimsuit is SO CUTE! But unfortunately it’s a bit tight for my daughter. So that’s a bit frustrating.
3.0,Way to small. Gave it to a friend.
3.0,Not quite what I thought it would be. I don’t think the sleeves will stay rolled up it’s too silky kind of feeling and it’s kind of shear so I’m afraid I will have to wear something else under it.
3.0,It broke on the first time I wore it.
3.0,Cute sexy dress.
3.0,The sizes seem way off.  Super long legs for a toddler.
3.0,These socks were purcased as a gift Christmas 2019. They are very cute.  I cannot rate them because them because they have not been worn or even tried on yet.
3.0,Looked better in the picture.  Don't look at them too closely or you will see how rough the make believe silver casting is. I kept them though because they're hidden in my long hair. They're shipped from China but came quicker than I expected.
3.0,The touch screen is not so sensitive. It is a $30 purchase though... recomend for the price. My daughter likes it so far
3.0,"it was ok, but one of then I got smell bad. someone must have tried and returned, they did not do the sanitation to clean it, that disgussed me"
3.0,The bag is too big. I don't recall seeing the dimensions in the description.
3.0,"The pendant is really tiny, like a corn kernel size."
3.0,They are cute earrings but to say they are garnet colored is a little misleading. They are more red then a real garnet is. Real garnets tend to be darker. These are closer to a ruby in color. But cute.
3.0,"3 stars because their super cute, but very uncomfortable.  No cushion or support at all, felt like boards."
3.0,"Its very cute but very stiff. I’ve had it for a while now and I always have it, but it’s so stiff."
3.0,"These shoes were gorgeous. I loved them, but when I had recurved them, they ended up being too small. Such a bummer as I was hoping these would be the heels to wear to my wedding. Luckily though they weren’t a total waste to buy, as they fitted my matron of honor perfectly (I wear a size 9, she wears a size 8), but I’m still admittedly bummed out."
3.0,"I have not used the glasses yet, but there was supposed to be a cleaning cloth and an HD tester and neither were included."
3.0,These are well made big honestly size up.
3.0,cute but kind of cheap
3.0,Neck isn’t as wide as pic. Tight crew. Fits smaller
3.0,"The shorts were just as pictured, very casual.  However, they run very small.  I bought these for my nephew who usually wears a large pants/shorts.  I purchased the extra large and they were too small.  I had to return them"
3.0,Flattering but very little room on straps to tighten or adjust.  Order one size down because the top is large.
3.0,"I like the dress,But after I washed it it fade it really bad. I washed it in cold water and let it air dry. Pretty for her first time use and maybe dry cleaning moving forward."
3.0,"Just adequate.  As with all friction-type  mounts, it comes loose.  It fits a variety of temples, but you will be picking your glasses off the floor more often than you expect."
3.0,The design is correct but I received a black shirt instead of gray that I ordered. Disappointed.
3.0,"These feel like pantyhose, not quite see-through, Definitely do not dry them they will get all pili! I don’t recommend buying for the price, I’m not very good quality material"
3.0,"Its somewhat small, but other then that, its good sturdy quality for the price."
3.0,Looks great. The Material is thin so you need to wear black underwear underneath
3.0,I thought the ends were completely flat and they aren't. They have a crease that tends to hold product in it.
3.0,"Swimming is a popular pastime in my household. It is warm for most of the year where I live and we have an in ground pool in our backyard. We constantly need accessories and swimwear and one that my wife found reasonably to her liking is this swimwear, Misassy Women’s Ruffled One Piece Swimsuit.<br /><br />This swimsuit is true to fit. Based on the size indicated and other factors, it fit as it should. The navy blue color is nice also and the material is comfortable, or at least as comfortable as a swimsuit can be.<br /><br />One area of confusion with this swimsuit is the shoulder straps- should they be worn on the shoulder or off the shoulder? My wife tried it each way but had more success wearing it off the shoulder. The pics and videos show it on the shoulders, but it doesn’t work well that way, at least for us.<br /><br />The padding on this swimsuit is good overall, but another issue we had is with the open section, in the center. This area wasn’t made very well, as it has loose strings. You may be tempted at first to pull the strings, but this is not a good idea, since it could tear the swimsuit.<br /><br />Overall, the Misassy Women’s Ruffled One Piece Swimsuit is an acceptable swimsuit. It does have its issues, but it’s good enough to add to my wife’s swimwear rotation."
3.0,I have not worn the jacket yet. I wanted it in the green but somehow ended up ordering the blue. Not sure what  happened
3.0,SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS!
3.0,This charm was very pretty but the clasp broke the first time used it. I'm just going ti fix it myself. Too much hassle to have it replaced.
3.0,I loved them. Put them on they are warm and fit well.  However one wash and a pair already has a hole.  This shouldn’t happen.  So left me disappointed.  I didn’t expect disposable socks
3.0,"I like the look of this watch. I have small wrists, even for a woman (about 6 inches around) so this was about as big of a face as I'd want. I get compliments on it all the time. I took off 2 stars because it is a little irritating to the inside of my wrist, the sensitive area, so much that I almost never wore it again after the first time. But now voice worn it about 5 times and it seems to be getting better. I'm not sure what it is, but maybe a seam or something that's scratchy where the closure is? I've just been wearing it a little loose so I can move it so it's not always rubbing in the same place. It is also starting to &#34;shed&#34; a little on the edges of the band."
3.0,The black one is really big & if you use the bracelets around water the color will fade a little
3.0,"I was super excited for these boots because I have bigger calves and can never find boots that fit. The calve part fit perfectly but what I don’t understand is that the ankles part is just as tight as normal sized boots. More often than not, plus size ladies with big calves also have bigger ankles. My ankles are squeezed in super tight and the boots feel like they cut off circulation. Wish they would take that into account because the boots are absolutely gorgeous!"
3.0,"These only work if you have big feet. It’s very pretty but I have to modify it somehow so it will fit my feet, I wear a size 6"
3.0,The bottoms are comfy but they ripped Asoon as I put them on they have deteroitated more since spend 30 on  decent bib
3.0,"Nice materiales, great color, but size did not match. I bought L size but is like a Small."
3.0,I have no complaints about the glove itself besides things way off my hands are really small and these were so tight I couldn't use them I had to send them back so just be really conscientious of what sizing
3.0,"Got these bags for the stroller but to be honest, I am not sure what I am supposed to do with them. They are cute but they are kind of small which is why I am not sure what they will be used for."
3.0,I always order from miusol when it comes to dresses.  This one however was too long for me.  I'm 5'5
3.0,Too big and slides down constantly. I ended up throwing it out after the first time I tried walking outside with it.
3.0,Cute style but the material is very thin. Wish that it was wool and not cotton.
3.0,"Fit was too big around the waist. The print is pretty, but the material is polyester and thin, so if you have a midsection to hide, it won't be hidden when you sit down. Kinda just a ""meh"" dress."
3.0,Material is thin but looks sturdy. Ordered a size up and it was still about a size too small.
3.0,"Being that I have a similar name I bought it but sadly the bow is not showing in full probably due to that's not coming from the happiest place on earth itself (Disney) they may have had to manuver in China how to print this mask. The way the elastic is sawn to the mask it covers part of the bow as being a little folded in with pleats as the elastic pulls. So, a little dissapointing cuz the picture shows the full bow. Other than that it fits comfy, you can breath, and the bottom shows Minnies panties with her polkadots.<br />But that's the reason for only 3 stars."
3.0,"Attractive, but be careful about caching the letters on any material."
3.0,"No llegaron dos unidades, solo una.<br />Es un poco apretado de la cintura, de la cadera y piernas esta muy cómodo."
3.0,"Too thin and doesn’t look to real for me, good product tho."
3.0,these dresses are so cute but way too large! I bought smaller sizes and it's still too large! my older daughter wears 4t to 5t normally and I changed this to a 3t and it's still falling off of her. unfortunately I have to find different dresses for my girls.
3.0,"These pantyhose look exactly as pictured; however, they were very small for a one size fits all size. I weigh 105 pounds and usually wear a small or extra small in everything but I had to really pull on these hose to get them up all the way and once they were all the way up they are quite snug around the waist.  The bat appliques are on the back of the hose as well as the front so they are designed nicely. Also, some of the bat appliques faded while I was pulling the pantyhose up. It's like the appliques pulled apart or something. These might be OK for a young teen to wear for sizing and I would be very careful when pulling them on so as to avoid damaging the applques. For the price, I guess they are a OK buy. I just wish they were a little roomier."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this bra. The fabric is soft and smooth, and the band was the correct length when I followed the sizing chart, so it didn't constrict my ribs. I wasn't even bothered by the fact that I didn't get the bra extender because the band sizing was correct. I was impressed and decided to wear it immediately.<br /><br />I wore the bra for an hour and discovered that the bra straps are way too short. Even when I let them out to their maximum length, they dug into my shoulders and caused the bra's band to bunch up underneath my arms and around my back. I'm a 38C, so I can't even begin to imagine what wearing this bra would be like for a woman who has anything above a C cup.<br /><br />What seemed to work for me was hand-stretching the straps slightly and then wearing the bra. The straps still dig a little, but it's better than it was before. However, I don't know if this would work for women with larger cup sizes.<br /><br />Another one or two inches of length on the strap would have made this the perfect bra."
3.0,It’s real cute but already broke on me only wear it once. Glows real good.
3.0,"I didn’t like this brown color. It was a very dirt brown color. The shorts fit nicely, but once washed- they need ironing and the elastic laid flat. A little more work than I wanted for casual shorts. These were also slightly big on me"
3.0,"I'd say it's a little on the large size, I don't mind the extra material around the middle section, however, it won't stay on my shoulders cause it's too wide. The pockets are terrible and not in a flattering location at all, result= bunchy hips in a fairly smooth line clothing product.<br />I also received the wrong color which made it much easier to decide to return."
3.0,Love all of them. Especially the differeny sizes. However one the big earrings I got three pairs of red and one black. I really wanted the black big pearls.
3.0,Not 40 pieces but they are nice
3.0,Not big enough for a XXXL
3.0,"I ordered an XL, as XL's are normally perfect for me.  However, although labeled an XL, these are small.  They seem to run tight across the lap area,  If there was just a bit more room in this area, they would be great.  I love the length, the color and the zippers, just not the fit.  Another thing is, there are no back pockets.  It appears that there are back pockets, but there isn't, just a flap.  At least give us one rear pocket?"
3.0,"La correa delgada pero, peor es nada."
3.0,"It's a rough fit, b/c I am 5'5"" and 160 lbs- it made me look very short and wide."
3.0,"I'm a 2x & ordered the same. I love this vest, but this didn't even go around to the front. It only went as far a the outside of my arms. This is beyond needing to go up a size or 2. SO disappointed!"
3.0,"Runs big and a bit bulky for small fingers, but for the price you can not complain."
3.0,"Nice socks, came packaged really cute. But to big for my sons feet."
3.0,Hinges were tight and appear to won’t last long. Hard to open and shut.
3.0,Fit doesn’t meet total expectations. Longer inseam than picture indicates
3.0,I used this bag for a couple days at work and the PVC began cracking.
3.0,"These gloves fit my 5 yo's hands, but probably not for long. Not too much stretch however they will do their job this year as he is averaging one lost glove a week."
3.0,"I love this shirt, but unfortunately I mixed up with the size chart.  The &#34;small&#34; is actually a 12-18 months.  It is such a beautifully made shirt though, so I will be giving to a friend for Christmas.  Wish I would have purchased the right size for my own child."
3.0,These earrings are very cute and lightweight but they are really cheap looking Thanks!
3.0,Going to get the next size up and hope this fits bettet
3.0,"Nice sunglasses, but received the wrong color 3 times"
3.0,Not bad. A little smaller than expected.
3.0,"I've been using sun sleeves for years.  Normally I use them for cycling (I wear a medium in Pearl Izumi sun sleeves, bought here on Amazon).  I've expanded to using the sleeves for kayaking and long drives during the summer to avoid ""trucker's arm"".  These look great, but run really small.  I had them on for about 15 minutes before it got too painful to keep wearing them.  Unless you need/like compression, get the Pearl Izumis."
3.0,Perfect for a tear apart night and size does fit all
3.0,"I love this top, but it is much shorter than I expected. When I raised my arms, It went above my belly button. I am 5’4 with a short torso and bought the small. Fit well everywhere except length"
3.0,These are nice but like I said they are too dark. It has been snowing here like nonstop and the days have been brighter thanks to all the white. These glasses even make that too dark
3.0,"The good: nice material, good quality, stretchy.<br /><br />The bad: unless you have an extremely long torso or are six feet tall, these are way too big in the crotch. Please see the pic with a name brand thong for comparison.<br /><br />I had to return them."
3.0,Colors are vivid and good<br />Size is small. Will prob not fit a 6 year old.<br />Seashells are glitter and will prob wash off after two washes.
3.0,was very small for a medium
3.0,"Meant as a gift. It was a tad too small even for a woman's wrist and it wasn't easy to put on either. Not a bad piece though, but definitely on the small side."
3.0,Cute but the pendant came off shortly after
3.0,They are cute but the posts aren't gold plated so they turned my ears green.
3.0,I read the reviews and saw where a grandmother bought this for her 8 year old and how she loved it.  My 8 year old granddaughter wanted this for her birthday and thought it would be fine after reading the review.  It is a nice bracelet but way too big for my 8 year old.  Best to measure before ordering.
3.0,"Waist is small. Legs for true to size. Khaki color is not khaki, it’s more of a yellowish color. Not cream but more yellow"
3.0,Bag is only a month old and starting to unravel !
3.0,Didn't realize it was sweatshirt material. Still worked out.
3.0,Quality not thete
3.0,It’s a cute sandal but the toe piece is positioned far back. I would advise a size up.
3.0,"love the color. had this for a year now, if I wear when hot outside it can &#34;stain&#34; my neck a little green."
3.0,"My husband loved this shirt, but I did not realize it was linen, and I put it in the dryer, on low knit delicate setting. And it shrunk one whole size and it was useless. We had to order another one. It was very unfortunate. Do NOT put this shirt in the dryer!"
3.0,"xxl is not 18-20, wrinkles from shipping package seem permanent"
3.0,"It's a fine belt. I have another one exactly like it but I purchased a few years ago from another source.The only problem I have with it and why I gave it only three stars, is because I ordered a medium as a woman size. The belt I received is a size medium but it is for a man. Therefore it is too large for me and I cannot wear it. I have to talk the extra part of the belt through to belt loops and I don't want to do that. I would say it is also slightly wider than the stated 1 1/4 inches."
3.0,The watch is okay. I bought it for my dad and it doesn’t feel cheap but it also isn’t the best quality. The color isn’t as vibrant as shown in the product image.
3.0,"Loved the style of dress and how comfy it was. I bought the black first but sad to stay it faded and looked ""linty"" after first wash. I opted to buy a different style/color and have had no problems with wash or material. The dress is great but the fabric of the black style I would not buy."
3.0,"The bras seem to run a size smaller than listed. Example, a 38DD is really a 36DD and a 36DD is really a 34DD."
3.0,"It was not what I expected and I couldn't wear it. The elastic was extremely stiff and fabric was different than in picture. They did give me a partial refund, rather than me sending back, but I still can't use it."
3.0,"Girl! I looked like a pig in a blanket trying to get this dress over my curves. (Yes, I ordered my correct size) Needless to say, no the dress did not fit and it has absolutely no stretch to it. I recommend sizing up for this dress.<br /><br />Also my bra size is a Triple D and that dress wasn't coverings nothing but my nipps.<br /><br />But it does Look just like the photo So, three stars."
3.0,"Larger than described. Based on the measurements I ordered a medium and I should've gotten a small. Too big for my liking. Material sucks. Wrinkles super easy,  constantly ironing."
3.0,"Okay, but not as good of quality as I expected.  Will gift out to a friend."
3.0,"I love the fabric and look of this robe, however I am disappointed by the fit. I am normally a size M and it seems a bit short and doesn't have enough excess fabric once wrapped around me to be very comfortable. Maybe size up if you feel these may be a concern to you."
3.0,"This shirt fit fine, but the neckline is what I don't like.  It's bunched up in weird places and looks uneven...honestly looks pretty cheaply made."
3.0,Jewels on one flip flop fell out the first day
3.0,Really cute but super small!!! I bought these for a 12 year old and they didn’t fit his legs at all
3.0,Maybe I should have read the fine print and saw that it was a thermo material. I guess the word “Elegant” threw me off
3.0,"The item is as described but the quality of the ""engraving"" is not great. I ordered this as a gift and I am not sure I will give it since the name is so poorly done. I chose this item as they offered the Greek letters I wanted. Wishing I would have chosen a product with more reviews."
3.0,Really wanted to love this dress but the overall fit wasn't too flattering.
3.0,"This Jacket fits pretty true to form.  It looks really casual with jeans but can be dressed up too.  Get compliments on it all the time. The quality is comensurate to the price paid meaning it has ragged edges with lots of loose thread and no lining, double stitching, etc.  Overall a good value for the money."
3.0,I got a Medium color is good but material was not good at all and super see through. Jacket fit good 👍 bottom were a pass
3.0,"I measured everything and based on the size chart I ordered the size that matched my measurements.  (It was two size up from what I’d usually get but it was the given size chart so I went with it.) These are so large on me that I can’t wear them as I’m constantly being tripped up. I love material and the style though. These are usually so flowy, comfy and flattering when the fit is correct. I would not recommend ordering based on the provided size chart, I would try your size or one up depending on how large you want them. They seem to run very large."
3.0,"The top is pretty, but too large based on the size chart provided. I am usually a small (4) and ordered a medium based on the chart. It will have to be returned. It is too large overall, including in the shoulders. I will be exchanging it though because the top is pretty."
3.0,"Bought this for a 8 year old and they are too small, they come off when she tries to put her glasses on."
3.0,"Quite flimsy, metal is thin."
3.0,"Eh...was so hopeful for these, but they were HUGE on my face. I'll have to keep searching"
3.0,"These are super adorable gauges, and fit true to size. The only reason I’m giving them three stars is because the pair with the green strands and the pair with the white strands don’t stay straight after I pulled them out of the packaging. They kind of bend to the left or right. However I dipped both pairs in boiling water and allowed them to dry on a flat surface and they seem to be better now. Just be careful how you store them to prevent binding. Also the screw backs are a little hard to get on. But really good buy for the price, I just fear I’ll have to keep dipping them in hot water to make sure they stay straight."
3.0,"I did not like how this dress fitted. Further, the fabric is not of good quality- it is too soft. Would rather that it was a tougher fabric."
3.0,"The price is great, but the style of the pudding does not work for my body. The padding is not wide enough to provide comfort to my pubic bones. Other affordable brands have wider padding that works better for my body."
3.0,"I didn’t know what to expect - this was the first time I ever bought these type/style of pants- they definitely are a very very thin cotton material- too light for anything but summer wear, and a bit see-thru..... also after washing they wrinkled  up very very badly, it was difficult ironing out the wrinkles."
3.0,Live the way it looks just  runs small.
3.0,the picture on the t-shirt is rough and started to come off after maybe 10 washes
3.0,"These are one-sided. That's as advertised, but most silver tone charms at this price point should be three dimensional. Also disappointingly thin and flimsy."
3.0,They are Ok
3.0,Good quality material. I like the pockets but definitely not what I consider high waisted. Returned and went with UA high waisted.
3.0,"I bought the size I normally take. I am large chested and found the top to be too loose so that it hung down in the front, showing my bra. It was long for my 5'4"" height. Fabric is light and airy. The buttons have a piece of material to cover the openings between the buttons, but it doesn't stay in place. A solution would be to sew that shut since the buttons don't have to be functional. I decided to return it due to the large top."
3.0,the seam going down the back isn't cute.
3.0,Product was too small to read
3.0,Love the style and fit however one shirt arrived with stains on it.  The white one.  I wanted to have them send me a replacement but was only given the option to return.
3.0,"I liked the coat &#34;look&#34; very much, but it didn't fit well in the shoulders.  Unfortunately, it was not offered in an extra large."
3.0,I loved it but the glasses bend easily making them crooked and I wish they were thicker or longer
3.0,This was my 3rd pair of compression socks.  The other 2 were from Sockwell and I had no problems with those.  Unfortunately this pair felt way too tight at top near my knee.  The foot is the right size and the length is ok ~ just too tight.  I can't wear them.  Someone with thinner legs then mine would probably have no problem.
3.0,"El material es bueno. Sin embargo, pedí talla 9 y me llegó talla 10."
3.0,"Kinda thin, kinda clingy. It’s ok"
3.0,I didn’t find these to be as soft as I like and they were bigger than I thought they’d be.
3.0,"Purchased for 6’3, 220lbs person.<br />Nice looking jacket however WAY too small and overpriced for what it is. Order two sizes up. I ordered a XXXL and was sent an XXL. Will be returning."
3.0,Were too small
3.0,"Beautiful chain!  But too delicate for my 18 year old and his gold pendant.  It broke the first week he had it.  Oh well.  At least i didn't spend over $300.00 like i did on the original chain i had bought at the mall.  Honestly, this diamond chain was much prettier than the really expensive one, but apparently my child is too rough or the pendant is just too heavy.<br />In the photo i have the original $300 chain, and then this inexpensove chain i bought off of Amazon and the pendant that broke both."
3.0,"Although I like the look and feel of these pants, they are not sized as stated. The product description states for the customer to buy their regular size which I did. I have been a size four for years and years and these pants are too tight. So, customers may want to be aware that they may have to go up a size when ordering. I will be returning and ordering a 6 to see how they fit. UPDATE: I received my size larger and they fit perfectly. They were comfortable for all day, held their shape and are figure-flattering. I am not changing my 3-star rating due to the misinformation in sizes."
3.0,Love stars. Hate the rusting.
3.0,good product just order a size bigger
3.0,It’s cute. Nothing special. Chain a little thicker than I’d have thought it would be.
3.0,Its tight but works. Problem is that the pony's head is cut off.... so that sux
3.0,"The dress is nicely made and so unique. The material is comfortable but looks a bit dull. I really wanted to love this dress, and even tried ordering it twice, in different sizes. The dress runs on the smaller side, especially around the chest area. Both sleeves and hemline are shorter than pictured. The dress falls just below the knees, and I'm only 5'3"" tall. Overall, it's not a bad dress, but just not as pictured and I would have loved the longer length."
3.0,I bought this to pair with a Huawei watch.  Aesthetically it's pleasing and the mesh feels well on the skin.  The spring bars that come with this are too small so the band does feel loose against the watch and moves way more than I like.
3.0,The front pockets are too small
3.0,"Cute dress, but it definitely was worn before. It smelled so strongly of perfume and instead of being nicely folded it came crumpled up in its bag. Pretty disappointing, because I’m sure it was worn before and I was expecting a brand new item. I ordered an XS and it fit well."
3.0,"They broke before I could even wear them. However, they were SUPER cute."
3.0,It looks just like the pictures & fits perfectly the only thing i did not like was the quality and fabric the shirt was made out of. I haven’t worn it yet because of the weather.
3.0,Needed this tote a little bigger. But otherwise nice.
3.0,Just my
3.0,"I'm a pear shaped gal, so even if I got a smaller size I doubt it would fit, even with the lace-up back. Overall this was a good dress for the price, but you'll need bigger chest than I have to fill it out.<br />My measurements.<br />Bra band : 37<br />Chest: 41<br />Waist: 37<br />I bought an 18W"
3.0,"I wear a size 6 and I got the small. It isn't as snug in some areas to better fit but I think it's of that era where it wasn't supposed to be as form fitting as todays standards. I too dislike like the lining being so short, I bend the wrong way and you'll see my derriere, not a bad thing per my boyfriend but definitely not what I want for a holiday party so I'm going to get it altered (hopefully it works out okay). The dress is actually more champagne then white. Also in the back at my tail bone it bunches oddly, it's noticeable and not a huge problem but it doesn't look right. One of the tassels arrived unraveled but hopefully it'll just blend and not be noticeable.<br /><br />Also I ordered it Nov. 7th and it's now Dec. 3rd. It comes from China, so I guess it takes that long to arrive. Not sure I would order again just due to shipping."
3.0,"These socks are pretty, I like the design.  I'm not sure how long they will last, they seem to fall down a bit during the day"
3.0,I got a XL it fits more like a M/L.<br />very soft material love the print too!
3.0,"This is ok, but not very soft for pajamas."
3.0,"Ordering bras online is always a gamble but this one worked out OK. After reading other reviews I decided to order one size up and I’m glad I did! I’m normally a 34DD so I went with a 34E and even it is a bit snug but it works. Compared to the expense of other sports bras, it was worth it."
3.0,"Very cute, but super small. I'm a size 12, a little thick around the waist to be sure, but this was meant for a small person. It's supposed to be loose and flowy - I imagine that would only be the case on someone who is a size small."
3.0,"I bought these for a costume. They're comfortable, but definitely run small."
3.0,"The photo makes the cardigan look heavy enough to hang without wrinkles, but it's actually quite light (and thus creased all over the place). I'll pop it in the dryer and see if that makes a difference. I can't quite put my finger on it... maybe the issue is just the thickness, but the quality in the image seems much higher than the quality of the product itself."
3.0,Cheap barely maybe give it to a young kid as play jewelry maybe probably not
3.0,"Not much to put here, short by an inch."
3.0,"It was just what I expected, it went perfect with my outfit"
3.0,I like the shirt but it runs small. I ordered a L first but had to send back due to being too small. I reordered a XL and it was better but not off the shoulder. I cut it myself to make it look and fit better.
3.0,Your average hoodie that is too short and rides up when you raise your hands above your shoulders.  Not too bad otherwise.
3.0,"The material for these leggings is a bit thick for my preference but it's not that bad, and it's not why I took stars off this review. My biggest issue is the fact that the butt seam is so low down that it cuts your butt in half which never looks good. The waist band is about a medium compression for me. I'd prefer it to be a little higher compression but I'd make do with this level of compression if the butt seam had just been higher up above my glutes."
3.0,I got two packages. They were advertised as &#34; assorted&#34; I got one package assorted and one package &#34;all white&#34;
3.0,Toooooo large! Daughter wears an 11 and a 10 still may have even been to big.
3.0,Nice bag but a little too big.
3.0,I ordered a small (5'6 116lb) but when the skirt came inside the package was actually a M. I returned it and ordered the small.  The small fit.  Don't love how the seams lay but it was $20 and it was comfortable. The color is super cute.
3.0,"its what you paid for, cups fall out in wash and one of my back straps is twisted, but its fine."
3.0,It's okay but too large for me. Returned it already.
3.0,"I’m a pretty much an off the rack kinda guy. Thighs are not gigantic; I do a fair bit of running and hiking.<br /><br />I bought two pair of medium shorts. I find that the elastic undershort is a tad loose and tends to slide down during runs. If I had to guess, this problem will become worse over time and wash cycles as the elastic begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Pros - no chafing, cell phone pocket is secure, drawstring does not easily get lost in the waistband after washing."
3.0,They are a little small for an adult face but I can still wear them. Unfortunately one of the lenses came out after a little over a month wearing them and I can not get it to stay in anymore. A little disappointed.
3.0,I didn't keep the dress because I didn't like the fit
3.0,Close up and in real looks untidy
3.0,"Fit true to size, but did not like the quality. The ribbon around the waist is pretty cheap. Could probably go to Hobby Lobby and get a better quality. The back.... The gap between the zipper and the clasp behind the neck is very odd! It doesnt look right. Also, the lace top is totally sheer. There is no way to wear any sort of spanx or bra with this. Other than that, it was okay."
3.0,Had to give away wouldn’t fit
3.0,La parte de arriba muy fea y arrugada
3.0,Unless you have literally no boobs these are not supportive in a way way. Guess it’s a new set of sleep bras.
3.0,"Most under armour youth sized shoes run very narrow. I was hoping these were different, but they aren't. My kids do not have wide feet and no other brand fits as snugly across the foot as these. We used a shoe stretcher though and then they were a perfect fit. My son loves the style and they do look fantastic."
3.0,"Looked so cute on the model when I bought it. Um, looks nothing like that in person. Too long. Too wide. Arms fit odd. Returning. Fabric is just okay"
3.0,It's ok. The charms don't stay in place.
3.0,"There was a chin strap included, but there are no holes or threads or any other visible way to attach it to the inside of the hat, so I'm not sure why they bothered."
3.0,"I just received my labradorite bracelet and it is very pretty. However, I bought it advertised as 8mm beads and 6.5” in diameter and it is way smaller. The tag on the bracelet says 6-7mm and it’s only 5mm beads. I can put the bracelet on, but I have to stretch it a lot and I have very small wrists. I put it next to my chakra bracelet with bead size 8mm and 7” in diameter and you can see the difference"
3.0,"Very mixed feelings about this product. The zippers, material, and strap are all top-notch. It is very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The problem is the back flap. It's held closed by a velcro attachment that's about 1 sq. Inch. If you load it up the corners flare out because the one piece of velcro is bottom center. With it filled up it looks ridiculous. I fead reviews where people mentioned how the magnetic closure worked well. No magnets here. One piece of velcro. I wish I'd known. I'm not fond of the look of the back flap, but if it had good magnetic closures, I'd have rated this 5 stars"
3.0,the slippers look nice but the white fuzzy stuff falls of allover the place it is messy
3.0,Didn’t like the neckline and the fit size XL was tight. I also thought it would be cotton and it’s a different fabric (poly blend stretch )
3.0,This is a casual Style dress. I loved the material and the pockets in this dress. The mid section was too lose on me. The length is great & the navy color was good
3.0,"These are small, just sayin'"
3.0,god toolarge
3.0,"The fabric is awful, terribly flimsy even for a fashion scarf, but you can't argue with the cats or the price."
3.0,It’s a nice sweater my boyfriend loves it! The only problem is it says “Jijitsu” on both sleeves instead of “Jujutsu”
3.0,"The color was pretty and it fit well, but that weird tie in the front threw the whole look off. Why is it there and does it really need to be day-glo green???"
3.0,When I open the package I was so excited because I love anything skulls... but the material of the romper was not so great and the stitching was even worse... I honestly haven't washed the romper yet but when I do it will probably be under the sensitive load and I will probably air dry it... With that said I absolutely love the way the romper looked on me which is why I gave it a three-star rating... I'm just happy that I had an Amazon gift card to reduce the price because I could have gotten something much nicer for $20
3.0,Good quality but way too small to use.
3.0,Too small for a 32 waist. Nice but returned mine.
3.0,"From previous reviews I thought the material (fake leather) would be softer or more pliable than it is. Very stiff and plasticky. It's a nice looking purse, but I have yet to find the perfect fit for my needs. I want a small purse that is big enough to accommodate my cell, my checkbook, my cards/id, lip gloss, tissues and a pen. Clutch/organizers are a smidge too small and this is a bit too big. I kind of feel like an old lady when I carry it. Again, not bad, just not what I needed."
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the bands, just n ou t what I was looking for they are very manly looking"
3.0,"Nice product, runs small. I bought 1 size over my normal due to product reviews I read, but they were like pulling on compression hose."
3.0,"they run a bit large they are stretchy and get squeaky, comfortable but feel arch wearing down probably can’t sneak up on anyone but great house shoes"
3.0,"Fit well, comfortable but not very durable, it ended up breaking after 3 months."
3.0,"And the XL would up fitting my 28&#34; waist frame jsut perfectly.  The stitching on the cup is poorly done - pokes out making a comical shape - but I am a female I bought these for under summer dresses and the fabric is great!  For $8, they are ok, but I will seek out better shapes."
3.0,"Our son wears a XXL shirt - sometimes they are a bit large on him, but I thought this would fit.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SHIRT LIKE?<br />This shirt is made from a thin chambray fabric.  It is 100% cotton as stated which is good.  It does not appear to be pre-washed which means that shrinkage is more likely than it is with pre-washed shirts.<br /><br />STITCHING<br />Stitching is fantastic.  Triple row and double row stitching decorate this shirt in white contrast to the denim tone of blue in the fabric.<br /><br />BUTTONS<br />The buttons are a bit small for this size shirt- I would have liked to see them just a bit larger, but that might not bother most people.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />When making a large sized shirt- putting tiny pockets on it tend to make the shirt look weird.  These pockets are a bit small for this size of a shirt.  They should be larger.<br /><br />FIT<br />This is not an oversized fit by any means.  This is made to be a bit smaller than other big/tall sized shirts.  The fit is smaller than we expected- and it is a bit shorter too.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shirt, decent quality with a few size issues where parts look a bit small for the size it is.  If it appeals to you and you are on the larger side, try ordering a size or two up from normal if you like things roomy.  This is also prone to shrink more than other shirts too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This is a nice shirt, but could do with some improvement to make it a really GREAT shirt for this size man."
3.0,"I gave it to my sister as soon as i recieved it. The quality is very poor but it looks very cute with the right outfit. The feather came in all bended when i recieved it, also it came in before the estimated date."
3.0,"Nice color of green but was itchy and one size too large. I'm 5""3 - weigh 106- small was too bulky"
3.0,They came scratched! I am trying to figure out how to get another pair shipped!
3.0,Strap too short the purse it’s self is cute!
3.0,"Cute and playful- definitely worth the money.  My only complaint is that one pair was broken when I opened the box and I was sent two pair of the same earrings instead of the 12 shown.  So, I only have 10 of the 12 pictured."
3.0,Very pretty but color was a little different than shown
3.0,"it is a short waisted sweater...keep that in mind, like a midi"
3.0,"This jacket was much smaller than expected, even though I ordered a larger size than what my son wears. It was also material that was similar, if not the same as, costume material. However, the seller was very accommodating and helpful and refunded my amount of purchase."
3.0,"Bought these to fulfill my free shipping.  Exactly what I expected, perfect for camping!  More on the novelty side of sunglasses rather than everyday use, in my opinion :)"
3.0,These socks are large in the toes and slide around when practicing yoga-very uncomfortable.  I had a friend try them on who has bigger feet (wears a size 9 and she said they did the same thing).  MEAIGUO received my review and immediately issued a refund and I did not even ask for it.  They are very committed to providing a good service.  Wish they fit-good company
3.0,"The product came when it said it would, the material was good, but I was very disappointed with it being the wrong color. I made sure I selected the correct one I wanted and even went back to make sure. I received a khaki color when I requested the white."
3.0,I ordered this product to go to my vacation to Vegas next month. I ordered an extra large just to be on the safe side and the product still seemed to be small and tight and usually I wear a size large but looking at previous reviews I tried to go up a size and it was still a little tight. The outfit is pretty tho it’s just the material I’m not too fond of
3.0,I must say that my son looked stunning wearing this. One side of the pants was missing the button to where the suspenders attach. It seemed as if it was never sown on. I was still able to make it work. No one noticed it besides me...
3.0,This came big
3.0,"I purchased these for one night out specifically and despite having Prime 2 Day Shipping....needed them in one day.  So I paid the extra $4.99 for 1 Day Shipping because the cost of the pants was SO cheap to begin with.<br /><br />I was really happy with the overall fit of the pants and sized up according to the posts since I already have an issue with being &#34;long in the thigh&#34; where even &#34;talls&#34; in a lot of pants aren't long enough from crotch to knee for me despite only being 5'7 overall.  The length was fine and the fit was pretty good (a bit too loose at the top), but these are stretchy, so you really don't need to worry about the sizing as much as people are saying.<br /><br />I ordered the &#34;Snakeskin Black Matte&#34; in the hopes that the pattern + matte would make these go with more casual tops and outfits more easily.  The pattern is...&#34;meh&#34;.  It's Snakeskin, but barely looks like it.  The pants are VERY thin and although comfortable....are not soft or lined with any sort of softer fabric.  They kind of feel like a Halloween costume that's fitted.  All of that was still OK.  I wore them with a long top and shiny, black high heels.  They looked great from afar....up close, they looked and felt cheap.<br /><br />My main issue that takes this from 4 stars to 3 stars is that the top immediately and constantly bunches down, flips over, slides down and doesn't stay in place for anything other than standing totally still.  Which ruins the purpose and look of leggings when they are sliding down.  I'm not sure if it's because I sized up as advised or if there just isn't quality lining around the top....but I was tugging, pulling, adjusting, and trying to get them back up CONSTANTLY through the night and all I was doing was walking, sitting, standing, and bending.  No dancing or anything wild.<br /><br />I won't be wearing them out to dinner again or anywhere I need to look nice and sleek (and not be grabbing and adjusting my clothes)....but I guess I'll keep them for casual wear or if I'm wearing something really bulky that hides the bunching and folding and falling.  It just made them really uncomfortable and took away the confident feeling of showing off your legs, butt, and hips in pants like these.  That's the whole point....to feel good showing this area off and when the pants are ruining what you naturally have....that's a problem.<br /><br />Since the price is so low, returning them is likely pointless....but I think I'll shop for another brand and spend slightly more in the future for pants that I'm not afraid of showing in bright light and that I can bend and sit without them falling off and bunching up.  Recommend with caution.  Maybe don't size up (?)  I feel like if I'd have ordered my size maybe this wouldn't have been an issue, but I'm not sure....so my review stands as it is."
3.0,"These were too gaudy and big for me but my daughter loved them.  It just goes to show you, it's all about individual taste."
3.0,Fit is very small but nice sweatshirt
3.0,Works.  Material not very expensive looking but a nice design and fit for a casual wear top.
3.0,"This purse is absolutely beautiful.  I love the inside pockets and layout.  There are pockets on the outside on each side; one for my phone and the other for my keys.  When it arrived, it was packaged like a purse that costs hundreds of dollars, but it doesn't.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the handle has already started lose some of its color."
3.0,"Other reviews said they were small, and I wanted small, but these are very, very, small and somewhat overpriced.  Having said that,  I have them now and will keep them.  I wanted something I could put in and forget about.  They are comfortable to sleep in and I don't even know they are there"
3.0,They're nice. But after about 2 hours they start to hurt at the top of the ear where the hook is.
3.0,The sleeves are VERY long.
3.0,This hat was good quality and I received it in proper time. I purchased a small/medium but since it is flex fit it fits a little bigger than expected I should of purchased a small. however it is nice and I wear it all the time on duty.
3.0,the clip comes off and its weak.
3.0,i like this but as soon as i ordered and want to reorder they raised the price so i will buy no more. i was born on a Thursday but not last Thursday
3.0,Dress is okay.  It is very modest with the high neck line.  Would recommend a petit skirt underneath for it to lay right.
3.0,"Craftsmanship is low.  They have strings coming out after one wash.  They are really pretty though and fit just right.  I ordered medium, I'm size 29&#34; waist, 130 lbs.  I had the lace model, not the sheer."
3.0,"These are as nice looking as this picture shows. It’s like buying a McDonalds hamburger and it actually comes out looking like the picture. Unheard of for sure. But when you get that hamburger, it came out small enough you could hold it over your thumb and maybe eat 12-15 of these burgers. I put these underwear on and the backside slides way down when I sit and the front starts to squeeze…really tight. These black boxers turn gray from stretching so much. I am 5’8” and under 180 lbs. These should not be this tight. I already paid for regular boxers to replace these and this is the third time I have tried to wear them. Nope. Free ballin’ it for a while. I threw my old ones away when these arrived thinking I had made a good purchase. I hope the new ones get here soon. These will be in the trash."
3.0,I love it but it cannot zip up! And it is my usual size!
3.0,They are not durable. If you get hook stuck in them they tear a big hole your pants.
3.0,The armpits fit funny?
3.0,"I think this purse is beautiful, but it doesn't work for me. When it arrived, I was surprised at how big it is. I was expecting smaller. I've carried it around for several weeks, but finally decided I'd go back to my smaller purse, which isn't so heavy. Aside from the larger than I wanted size, the shape of it isn't the best for my tastes, either. It was hard for me to find things on the inside with the rounded bottom and it won't sit flat on the floor. Plus, I didn't like that the top can't be zipped. There's a snap to close it in the center, but the contents can still be seen. When I needed to set it in the floor(which was mainly at church, since I don't usually set it on the floor for fear of germs), it'd tip over unless I propped it on something, making the contents even more visable. I just like more privacy for what's in my purse. I always wear my purse crossbody style, so I wanted to remove the smaller handle. The longer handle is removable, but the smaller one doesn't come off, though. I'd try to stuff the small handle in the middle before I snapped it closed, but this was a bit of a pain. I just wanted it off. As far as looks go, I do really like it, though. It's just more of a pain than it's worth for my tastes."
3.0,I returned mine because was baggy @ the bust & too long for my liking
3.0,I am medium and the large size its tight go 2 sizes up!! But beatiful dress
3.0,"For some reason\s, products coming from our friends in China seems to think the whole world is: &#34;one size fits all&#34;  News flash! many persons are short, tall, thin, big in all different places.  I bought these  'Openwork Mesh Breathable Underwear...' a size bigger than I normally would for any  underwear I get.  To my amazement, they are still too small. I will keep them and pass them along as gifts."
3.0,"These are very nice dress gloves. They are made of soft and supple suede. It's a nice looking color. They fit well, the interior is a nice soft substance. Here's the thing thought. I work outside and lost one of my old suede winter work gloves. Those where tough as nails. Not these. Not even close. These are way to fragile. I'll keep these for everyday use and keep looking for heavy duty suede winter work gloves."
3.0,"*2 year update: I still bring these pants out for fall/winter and prefer them to go out in windy/cold weather. The outside material of the pants are starting to pill/show signs of use. However this may be due to exposure to fabric softener liquid/fabric softer dryer sheets. I hadn't read the wash instructions well and it says to not use these fabric softener products= faster deterioration of fabric.<br />However I won't be replacing these just yet but I believe I will have to in the next 2 years if I want max use out of them. Still in good shape otherwise.<br /><br />* Revised review after 1 year use of yoga pants by this company<br /><br /> One pair out of 3 yoga pants ripped at the seam in an inconspicuous area after it's first wash, it's held up and no issues with rest of pants .<br /><br />These are the pants I NEED and is a MUST for fall/ winter time, no more thin leggings or cold jeans! I've layered these under sweatpants for cold 35-50 degree weather and they've kept me toasty. Even when it was windy!<br /><br />I wear size 20/22 US or 2x in US pants, height 5'2, I decided to buy the xxl 29""<br />They are true to size and i recommended measuring yourself before hand and using their size chart.<br /><br />Thick material but not bulky, fleece lined inside yet smooth outer side.<br />The waistband is wide, the way I'm holding my hand in the first pic is the top and bottom of waist band (DOESNT ROLL DOWN!)<br />There is a zipper pocket on the back, would not fit a smartphone unless it's on the small side, but will hold keys or other small objects.<br /><br />Highly recommend for those wanting to invest in clothing that will last you through many winters, stylish yet comfortable, overall a basic and staple MUST for winter wear."
3.0,I like it now but it took 3 tries. Runs very small.
3.0,"I bought for my grandson who is 8 years old. He is a skinny and lanky boy, he usually wears a boys small.<br /><br />I ordered this and it looked like it was for an infant. I could tell the arms. And torso would be too short the minute I took it out of the bag.<br /><br />I was going to return for another size and found a nicer looking boys fleece hoodie on Nike’s website for half the price.<br /><br />It looked well made and high quality but not worth the money. I e fed up returning for an Amazon credit.<br /><br />He is about 4ft tall if that and weighs about 65lbs.  I should have taken a picture for reference."
3.0,Love how dainty it is. Unfortunately it’s to small for my nose.
3.0,Cute necklaces. Very cheap material.
3.0,"A bit too large, even though I bought a size smaller as instructed.  Should have bought at least two sizes smaller.  VERY warm and comfortable, with a cushioned sole."
3.0,"It stays on longer, despite the long walk.  When I received the product, the cream colored ones already have torn portions in it."
3.0,While wearing this yesterday it caught on my top and bent. Very pretty but not very sturdy.
3.0,"I bought this for my eleven year old daughter in a size extra-small and it fit perfect. The texture is nice, more like that of a blouse than a sweater. The pineapples are a really pretty bronze color. Overall very pleased with it!"
3.0,I got this on a whim due to my undying love of TS. It’s fun and heavier/more substantial than I was expecting but there are marking above the M and n that are really noticeable (you can see them in the photo if you look close) and look like blemishes even though they seem to be there intentionally.
3.0,I like different Styles but I wanted more silver than gold plated
3.0,"pretty, but very very small. I am returning it."
3.0,"This cell phone bag is very nice.  It looks good and is of good quality.  The only problem for me is that my Samsung note 5, with a case, was too snug to pull out of the bag easily."
3.0,I purchased a large and didn't try them on till after the return date and  found they were too large. Still nice but wish I would have gotten a size down
3.0,"I took a chance buying a hat through the internet without having tried it on, largely based on reviews that seemed to indicate it's a large/xl hat. But it was too small for me. Had to send it back.  Came as described, though, looked good."
3.0,After wearing the boots for 10 days that are still very squeaky. The sound is like walking in  ski boots on very cold snow.
3.0,"The fit was great when I got it. As expected, losing weight changed the fit. NBD<br /><br />The &#34;spiral steel bones&#34; poked straight through the fabric and stabs me like the wire from a bra. . . all over. I KNOW my waist isn't thin, but the adjustable bands roll into the middle of my waist and can be uncomfortable through the day.<br /><br />I feel like it somewhat does the job and for the price I won't complain too much because I still wear it when I walk. It is breathable and flexible and comfortable outside of the poking bones and the rolling bands."
3.0,The grey pair had a hole in the back seam.
3.0,"Cute. A lot smaller then what I expected. The chain twirls a bit too but makes for a thoughtful gift. I bought A, T, and S. The lettering could be a bit more bold its hard to see since its so small."
3.0,"Purchased this in green. It's a beautiful color and fabric seems nice (a little stretchy but that's okay) and flowy. The front was cut way too low and the straps are placed further back on the dress. Another, more important note - the pockets are located on the side (where the two pieces of cloth are sewn together) in the exact place my hips start, making them look larger. It's also a little short."
3.0,"I had to return bc they’re too heavy but, I liked them!"
3.0,"For cheaper, thinner, not as well made shorts, I ended up being grateful for the thinness in the hot and humid Baltimore heat. I ordered 3x and it fit as expected. Three stars are because one of the pairs sent were 2x. Cannot guarantee you will get the sizes you ordered."
3.0,No real shape top the dress but I was able to hide what I didn't want people to see. Turned out cute.
3.0,"The quality is good, but it runs really small in the hips.  An extra large typically fits really well, if not a bit loose, but I couldn’t even button the bottom two buttons!"
3.0,"I will take the blame as the seller didn't misquote the size, but I didn't read beyond the photo since it wasn't a big purchase and assumed they were at least an inch.  These earrings are so small I doubt anyone would notice what they actually are meant to resemble."
3.0,"This shirt is light weight, it's made alright, however it's smaller than expected, a lil bit more on the snug side."
3.0,This is not a satin purse!  No glitter.
3.0,"I love the way this suit looks. But the back is so thin and when you bend over, total crack visible.  I’m keeping it to use when not at a public pool.  Just wish the back had a little thicker fabric!"
3.0,"This dress was a baby shower gift.  Cute pattern on the dress, but I didn't feel it was made very well.  When i first received it, several of the buttons were very loose so I had to reinforce the buttons by hand sewing before wrapping the gift.  Other than that, it was very cute."
3.0,"The boot itself fits like my shoe size but, it is very tight in the calf. . There is no way you could squeeze your pants into the boot. But again you get what you pay for."
3.0,"These are super cute but they run small. I have one to my sister, one to my mom and one for myself. They were tight on all of us. My mom wears size 6. My sister wears size 7. And I wear 9 and 1/2."
3.0,"I order like 3 sizes up, and that worked, fits good. The material is the kind that will easily make pullers in it if caught on something.  Ok for price."
3.0,I love my pendant but had to purchase another chain.
3.0,It takes lots of try and patience to adjust to fit properly according to your head size.
3.0,This fit more like a 00 instead of a 1
3.0,"It was a little shorter than I expected, but it looked good on me."
3.0,Quality isn’t great. Cheaply made.
3.0,Definitely smaller than in the picture.
3.0,"Very wide even for my big head. Luckily, they were for a costume, one time use only."
3.0,"Pretty, but extremely small design."
3.0,"I got these for guests that come to my house because I don't allow people's nasty shoes on my rug so I give them these. They were much thinner than expected but again, fine for one time use. I also use them when I go on vacation."
3.0,"Talla real, la tela parece barata tal cual el valor"
3.0,Love Ariat insoles. But for guy my size (275) the circle at the heel is uncomfortable after long wear.<br />But good for only a couple hours
3.0,"The material is thin.  Wrinkles very easy.  I do like the buttons on the sleeves that make it easier to roll up, like a 3/4 sleeve. It does fit small in the arms.  I am larger like a 16 but I did order an XL."
3.0,"They are cute on. However, the butt is crooked. The seam down the butt is crooked and you can feel it when you wear them. Unfortunately I hadn't really worn them so I didn't notice it until I was passed my return time. They're more cheaply made than i thought. And I'm bummed about it."
3.0,"Armholes are sooo large, they barely cover my chest...and I'm not big!"
3.0,Works as advertised but  Material What's misleading picture represents to be a metal buckle button actuality some of the buckle is plastic 80% to be precise.
3.0,The hat is well configured. It arrived in a plastic pouch and was all wrinkled. Hard to get the brim to flatten out or the top to look like anything but a bag of wrinkles.
3.0,Not soft but looks cute on.
3.0,"The design on the pajamas isn't as attractive as seen on the computer.  The material is soft, but I am returning it because of the print."
3.0,Hood was way too small. My kid is small for his age too. It’s a thin jumpsuit.
3.0,I really wanted to love this because the quality is amazing but I think it was a mix up with the sizing because this product largest size was a large and I was sent an xl. I will be returning this product but ordering it again.
3.0,"I like the idea, but they didn't fit correctly.  They are really tight.  Some of the &#34;toes&#34; were really long and thin, I don't know, it was just a really tight fit, like uncomfortably tight.  I wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,Pretty but bigger than I thought and won't wear them.
3.0,"Oh.my.gosh. What does a girl have to do to find a decent bra these days? This one pours out the sides, perhaps I need a bigger cup??? 34F. (I already went up 1 size due to other reviews). Sending this one back."
3.0,Product received was darker than that shown in picture. It is more of a deeper Plum. Nicely crafted purse and spacious. Will be returning due to the fact that it did not coordinate with the &#34;purples&#34; of the outfit I wore for a wedding.
3.0,"The fit was ok. I think for the bust to waist ratio, it might have been a bit bigger in the waist. Also, the tucks in the skirt were off, and stuck out in a weird way. The material is definitely a cheap, slick polyester. I wouldn't buy it again. Considering returning."
3.0,"Following the manufacturer's size chart, I ordered a Tag size L = US Small, which fit me very well.  I am 5'5 (with a long torso) and  125#.  Normally I wear a size 2-4.  I really like the fit of this suit, and the flattering color block design.  BUT the padding in the top was completely visible through the pink color.  This might not be an issue with the darker suits.  It would have been embarrassing to wear it in public with the circular pads so noticeable.  I think the fabric is too thin for the type of padding used."
3.0,pierden el color
3.0,Everything was okay except for the sleeves. They were too short I had to send it back. Plus I ended up getting charged twice for this item and I still haven't got that worked out
3.0,"I like this shirt and even though I read reviews I still ordered my size. I am a pretty full medium and have a bigger chest but could prob wear a small! Its a pretty color purple, im gonna keep and wear with leggings"
3.0,Christmas present for my Granddaughter.  Its a lot thinner then I thought.
3.0,"Color is spot on. Soft material.  Size is a little oversized and would likely be great for leggings.  Nice sweater, but it really did nothing for my shape.  The quality was fine, it was just boxy and made me look wide.  If not for that, easily a 4 star item."
3.0,These are pretty earrings but too flimsy. Feels like they will bend or break easily.
3.0,"Sorry didn't notice a change in the briteness , tested a few different nights , probably use them for trap shooting glasses"
3.0,"Before ordering this bag, I read all reviews and took a chance. In the first 24 hours this bag broke. The zipper just let out and I barely had anything in it. The worst part is I was traveling in South America and then had no other bag to use for my toiletries. I definitely don’t recommend."
3.0,The shirt is good but pants to big
3.0,Top fits perfect but bottoms are a bit too cheeky for me!!
3.0,The CZ looked very fake
3.0,"It is sheer, expected a different fabric"
3.0,"I was so excited to get this top. It looked real cool in the pictures. Unfortunately the top is real stiff material, not soft at all and is super long. I loved the design on the back so I kept the top for that reason. I ended up cutting it shorter so it could look half way decent. I would advice to go 2 sizes larger but then it would be super long and not too tight. Either way I cant win with this top"
3.0,"I like the pattern and material, but I own several other IZOD shirts of the same style and this one seemed to fit wider in the torso area. I'm 5'10 and 170lb."
3.0,Runs at least one size small
3.0,"So the fit was just right, and it is soft and it was a great last-minute costume for Halloween. But as several reviewer‘s have noted, the spiderweb under one arm is sewn on backwards. That means when you hold your arms out there’s a web printed under one arm, and the other arm just looks black. If you looked at the back, you would see the other arm printed with the spiderweb and the first one is just black. I really wanted it for Halloween, so I kept it. I think I might even try to paint the web onto the sides that it’s missing from with fabric paint or some thing. Just so it’s symmetrical. it was cheap enough that I didn’t feel like returning it, just know that it will probably be like that."
3.0,Frumpy on me
3.0,"Cute short, but Fit smaller than expected"
3.0,These are warm but they run small
3.0,It was very thin material and didn’t like it
3.0,"Appreciate the feel and the look, much better than having to wear a generic mask. The only downside is the ear holes are oddly placed and make the mask ride a little high."
3.0,Great looking product......don't use if you have a lot of wind.
3.0,It is made of a stretchy material that I don't find as flattering as I would like.  I need more tummy support as I am a mom of 4.  I do like the cut of the skirt.
3.0,these are ok.  They fit fine but definitely don't love them. I mostly wear them to bed.  They are thin material and soft.
3.0,"Runs large, it is soft but has not held up well."
3.0,The packaging was folded and not efficient.  The shield has a crease down the center that I cannot get out.  I have steamed the hat several times attempting the get the wrinkles out.
3.0,"Awesome quality hat, but came crushed in shipping box"
3.0,Only thing I didn’t like about the white top it was too see through and fabric wasn’t what I expected..
3.0,I love the look and fit of my new glasses. The reason for the 3 stars is that the red pair does not have a flexible hinge on one of the legs.
3.0,"Update:<br />I previously rated these 5 stars and while I am still pleased with the first pair of leggings I received, I’m frustrated after attempting to get another larger pair.<br />I ordered a size larger and was really looking forward to getting them but I received the wrong pair. The bag that they were in was mislabeled. So I returned them and requested a replacement but the same thing happened. Wrong leggings in a mislabeled bag. Really frustrating. I don’t even want to attempt to have a replacement sent because I’m sure the whole lot of them are mislabeled. Bummer because I really liked these leggings. They were just a little bit smaller than perfect.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by these leggings. They look really good on, although they are a little bit smaller and more sheer than I anticipated. They are really flattering! I’m usually a size 6, small-medium in pants and I ordered these in medium. I should have ordered large but I do really like them. They look really good with the sanutch crop top."
3.0,"The image on the mask is very wide, so it makes me look like the Joker in the  Badman movie.<br />For someone with a broad face might look better with it"
3.0,"I got mine today. They are very comfortable, but for me too short. The description says that they are 41"" long. This is NOT the inseam. It's from the waist to the bottom of the leg. I really wish warm up pant manufactures would start making pants long enough for 6"" people."
3.0,"Too big, sent back for a smaller size."
3.0,Not quality but it's ok for the price..
3.0,The product is smaller than expected. A medium size for a boy is too small. Maybe a XL would fit better.
3.0,I purchased this wool shirt because of the rave reviews about being so soft.<br /><br />To me it is not soft at all. it is rough and feels scratchy.<br /><br />Also the color is a dull and unattractive navy blue.<br /><br />Returned it.
3.0,These slippers are soft but they shed badly all over my house.
3.0,The top is tricky to screw on... I ended up swallowing it....
3.0,"Nice, but too small for me."
3.0,they are OK not quite as described but not bad
3.0,Thought they were great when I first put them on but after about 30 seconds of the weight of my 36Ds in them the lace straps rolled up into just the little thin strap in the middle and was super uncomfortable. Made the mistake of trying to look cute with an off the shoulder top and wear it out of the house thinking I could just keep adjusting the straps. Nope. They rolled up as soon as I unrolled them so it just looked like I was wearing a boob squishing sports bra with spaghetti straps that dug into my shoulders and hurt. I ripped it off and burnt it as I got home and put the other two in the donation bag. May work for someone in the itty bitty committee but alas not for me.
3.0,sorry
3.0,"This is a decent bag for the price.  However, because it is advertised as holding a laptop (a thin one), I expected it to be padded in at least one compartment.  My 13&#34; MacBook Pro does fit in it, but it is not padded, and it does not fit if I put a sleeve on it to protect it.  Back to Amazon it goes."
3.0,"It’s a stretchy bracelet that I probably could have made myself. I’m not disappointed in the quality, but in the price.  I think when you order at the last minute, (it’s a St Patty’s bracelet—less than a week away), you pay the price if you want it."
3.0,"Like the shirt, like the fit, didn't shrink in the dryer.  Only problem is it's not blue it's grey, don't know if they sent the wrong color or if they call this vintage blue.  I'll keep it cause I like it ."
3.0,Lovely top but i find it hard to get into. Might need a wider neck opening
3.0,THEY OK. HARD AS HELL
3.0,"I really dislike the way Lucky is making the straps now, including this one, they aren't fully adjustable and just have 3 holes (like a belt) which just doesn't work for me. I grabbed this one because it's on sale for $25 but I'm sending it back purely for that reason. Ugh"
3.0,The bag is very nice exactly what I expect it didn't care for the strap doesn't stand in place very well
3.0,"5'8&#34;, 120lbs, 36 bust. Sits just an inch too long with flats, but works great with heals. It has not held up with washing though. Several washes in on delicate and it has started to pill and shed. I had hoped it would stay nicer, longer."
3.0,they turned out to 'fit' but definitely on the small side
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Lenses are super dark. I'm probably not really used wearing something so dark. Having worked as an optometric assistant for 4 years, I know quality vs. not. This polarization is not so great for driving but okay for walking around. Frame itself is cheap and flimsy. Cute style though."
3.0,"These are the most comfy pants ever, and even ran larger than I expected based on other reviews.<br /><br />Sadly, they started coming apart at the seams after one wash.  I will sew them, but it's not the way it should be"
3.0,"Pretty, too light and bright to be genuine anything."
3.0,big at the top
3.0,shrinks
3.0,"Beautiful, but you get what you pay for.  Not as large as I thought they would be but pretty."
3.0,"The feel, length and size are great. I love the color and pattern. The white part though is a little see through so I have to wear a longer sweater with it so people can't see more than they bargained for."
3.0,You can't expect to have a great product for a cheap price. You get what you pay.
3.0,Quite hard to setup.  Finally got there and a day or two later the world clock is wrong again.  Nice watch overall tho.
3.0,Not authentic colors.  Just looked like a costume.  But nice material
3.0,"The hat is just okay, runs a bit small.  Not as flexible as I expected.  Think I may plan to gift it.."
3.0,"What a lot of the other reviewers have been saying about these socks is right on. They're super cute but really small. Because of how small they are, the little bears sitting around the campfire and the sheep sitting on the bench stretch out and kind of distort when they're on. I don't have the same issue with the patterned ones (the black sheep/nordic print looking bears and trees are much cuter on, even though I bought the set for the other 2 patterns). It stated that the socks were for size 5-10 in shoes; I wear an 8 1/2 and I can't imagine them fitting on a bigger foot than mine. There were also lots of stray strings hanging off when I received them, and I had to snip a bunch of them to clean the socks up enough to wear them. The price isn't bad but the quality is reflective of how little you are paying."
3.0,A little on the brassy side but not bad
3.0,Ehhh.. wasn't what I expected to look like both material and fit didn't like the way it looked on me so I gave it away
3.0,It did not fit well. There were gaps.
3.0,I LOVE these glasses!!! But they were shipped in a sleeve instead of a hard glasses case and now they are warped since the day I got them. I keep trying to adjust them but I’m afraid that they will snap. But other than how they were shipped and damaged in the shipping these glasses are the best! I hope knockaround will consider shipping them in a box instead of a sleeve in an envelope.
3.0,"Fit great (plus sized), super comfy and great summer material. I own several pairs, but this one wasn't sownn right, and the pants ripped easily."
3.0,"They are really really warm and comfy and perfect for a brisk fall day. However I specifically bought these as winter boots. I also purchased spray to make them water proof so they would stay dry. The issue however is that the water seems to leak in from the sole of the boot. That left my feet wet when stepping out in the snow. The other issues are that they have no arch support so they are not very good for walking, which I suppose is fine because after wearing them for a season they now have a hole in the sole (at the heal), rocks get into the hole and make funny sounds when I walk!<br />So if you are buying these as &#34;house&#34; shoes and don't plan to do a lot of walking these are great boots. Just not very practical as actual shoes."
3.0,"These are very fun and super shiny.  I do wish they were stretchier because they only move with you to a point, and they're not 100% form-fitting.  Not the best leggings I have (I own a  *lot*) and the fabric is very delicate -- I accidentally touched the leggings with the weight bar while deadlifting, and the grippy metal part on the bar left some runs/imperfections in the leggings.  This was my first workout in them, so now they're damaged.  Oh well, I guess I'm keeping them.  They should increase the spandex content and offer full length leggings in this super shiny finish -- I would buy those!"
3.0,"The length is great, but the pockets are at a strange angle and sit farther back than normal. It’s very soft and warm just wish it fit better."
3.0,"I wear a medium, ordered a medium and the sleeves are like 3/4 length.  Size up if you want the fit shown in the picture!!"
3.0,"I have multiple pajamas from Ekouaer.  The material on most of their pajamas is very soft and the garments are well made.  The lace isn't scratchy at all.  I've learned to steer clear of the printed fabric because it just isn't as soft as the solid colors..  This pajama set was also comfortable but the top just did not fit as I would have liked.  It didn't taper in at all and looked way too wide on me.  It will still be a pajama set that is soft enough to sleep in, but not one to look cute in around the house."
3.0,"Normally, I wear a size 16 dress, but I've been losing weight, so I had someone measure me to be sure.  Based on my measurements, the size 18 would fit, but I ordered both the 16 and 18 just in case.  The dresses arrived folded in separate sealed bags in one package.<br /><br />I tried on the 16 and it fit beautifully, so I didn't even open the size 18 dress bag.  The material was severely wrinkled and about four or five of the jewels sewn to the dress were loose.  The jewels were both glued and sewn onto the dress, but the threads were very loose and one jewel was hanging by a thread, so I just cut it off.  The design wasn't affected noticeably.<br /><br />Underneath the chiffon material is a moderately heavy lined satin skirt, which was simple to iron.  The material was of decent quality.  As I ironed the chiffon, though, loose threads were quite apparent.  Many loose threads got caught under other embroidery and that's when I noticed that one of the designs was incomplete.  I hoped the lighting at the event would be dim so that nobody would notice.<br /><br />When it came time to put the dress on, the designer's tag was sewn into the side seam of the dress.  I used scissors to carefully cut the ropes as close to the dress as possible.  I found this odd, but maybe it's customary in the country of origin.  The length was perfect.  I wore 2&#34; heels and the dress was a couple of inches off the floor (I'm 5'7&#34;).  Later I switched to flats and the dressed skimmed the floor without dragging.<br /><br />You will need someone to lace up the back and maybe a second pair of hands to help make it tight.  My dress needed tightening half-way through the event.  I wore a strapless bra underneath for support.<br /><br />At the event, I got a few compliments and I just hoped that nobody looked too closely to see the flaws.  I kept the dress because I liked it, but honestly, I may only wear it this one time unless I remove all the jewels.  The next day, after the event, I found two jewels in my car that had broken off of their own accord.<br /><br />Overall, the dress is of moderate quality.  The design on the front is of less than good quality, but from a distance it looks beautiful."
3.0,"In a picture looked better, more gentle tone..."
3.0,They fit great  but we're miles too long.
3.0,The outfit is cute and good quality but be very careful with the suspenders. The metal pieces come off very easily and are a big choking hazard. Don’t leave your baby in the suspenders without being supervised. They work well for the purpose of pictures through!
3.0,"Cute top, but bad stitching--several places the hem has come apart.  For $12, I'll stitch it up myself, but be warned."
3.0,"Color was beautiful, weight was great! No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get the cute little collar to lay flat. Would wear it as it was. Had to return it. Made me sad."
3.0,"Like the detail work on sides of boot, but not much support"
3.0,"Like:<br />Nice pattern that stands out (due to color contrast) without being too flashy<br />Dislike:<br />I prefer at least a little padding, which also helps the fit around the toes.  It's a personal preference, so if you prefer no padding these should work well for you."
3.0,Love theses earrings but the post fell off after a few weeks.
3.0,The thickness of watch itself was think for me but overall all loved them just not what I was looking for
3.0,"I have the russet brown color and love it. The fit is great, and the material is awesome. The only downside to this particular color is that it runs on whatever shirt you’re wearing under. I had a white tank which is now pink so I decided to wash it for my next wear, however it also turned the white pull strings pink."
3.0,"This shirt is NOT cotton! There is NO cotton in this shirt!  That's probably why they don't have a label indicating the fiber content.  On the upside, it was not scratchy and I liked the satin piping around the sleeve cuffs and the collar, but otherwise, this shirt is not cool or sexy in the least.  It is boxy, long, and kinda dorky looking.  And it weighs a lot, which is another reason it cannot be cotton!  The search continues... sigh..."
3.0,Had to return it because it didn't say I love you. It said carlona. I was looking forward to it because I gave my husband 3 options and he picked it saying I love you but wasn't the case.<br /><br />Update:<br />Thanks so much for contacting me about my issue and making it right!
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:afeeb17df78e690da086212d3fefd700]] (6/4/22)<br />The photo gives the butterfly a beautiful pinkish look. The butterfly is white but maybe with the sun shining on it, it could have a pretty reflection.<br /><br />The butterfly is light in weight , not sure how durable it is yet. I’ll come<br />Back with an update soon."
3.0,I thought the night gown was longer.
3.0,size up by two sizes
3.0,Most of the pairs felt great except for one. Too tight and the elastic waist band came apart
3.0,"Cute outfit, love the material. The bottoms are a lot larger than expected but overall its a very cute and super compfortable outfit"
3.0,"I was warned that the pins may not all be genuine Disney, and that is true. I hope the grandkids still have fun trading them at Disney World."
3.0,"These shoes were so cute. However they are not for narrow or average feet. Even after adjusting straps to the last whole the foot area was still very loose,the ankle straps couldn't be adjusted any more it caused the shoe to ball up which ment they were just to big for someone with small ankles. Wanted these to try and whole ankle in place not for foot to slide all over the place. You can down size if you don't mind your feet hanging of the front when you walk. Order two different pair one for me in one size and another for my daughter. I was able to go down two whole sizes and they feet but they were to short. I really like these shoes however not sure about reordering. To much time to see if they will or won't fit."
3.0,It's a nice enough necklace but it was too thick for the pendant I wanted to wear it with.
3.0,"Thick fabric.  Nice and all but runs about 2-3 sizes small. Im typically a medium but right now postpartum im a large (ref: 38dd, 5'5"", 180lbs). Ordered the large and the bust area, armpit fit great but it doesn't look like picture with length. Id have to order 2 more sizes up to get that long flowy look. Returning item but might try bigger size and order later. Will update."
3.0,"Too small, had to return. Fabric was a bit odd,, not what I expect from something called chambray"
3.0,"I love love these colors not available thru Fitbit, but the two light ones take on any die transfer even if your sleeves aren't hitting the band! There's no way to clean it off... Sad. I love the classy neutral colors but not after the first wear."
3.0,I like the shirt but it is a little bit snug. I ordered the small size ( I am usually x-small American size). Asian size is one size (or more sometimes) than US size.
3.0,I got these to replace some chains that were too short.<br /><br />The box chain works quite well and is sturdy. The other chain is a bit too weak to use.<br /><br />At the current price listed (about $19) that really isn’t a good value for one necklace that isn’t even sterling silver.
3.0,"I have had many Lily Bloom purses.  I have used them until they were just past being used to go out.  I LOVE the color and of course the Dachshunds, but it is not holding up.  I do not carry it exclusively and I have no children that yank at it.  Threads are coming off, which is very disappointing."
3.0,This sweater is supposed to be a 3x. Not in this country
3.0,"The dress has a fun pattern, but unfortunately for a tall girl (5'9&#34;) it works better as a blouse!"
3.0,Like the way they feel wish they were not as bulky.
3.0,Son para mi mamá en cuba Gracias llegaron en tiempo.
3.0,"I was expecting these for a part of a gift but unfortunately got a different pair then what I ordered. They sent the right ones the next time but I did have to give them as a gift much later than I wanted to. In the end, I did get the glasses I expected and they looked good. I did not have time to return the other pair that initially came in time so I did end up having to pay for both."
3.0,It’s ok. Not silky or soft like it appears. Small fits more like a medium. Very baggy and it has no form. Very boxy. Almost like someone cut out a square and stitched it together. It might be ok with a push up bra and tucking it in high waisted jeans. Maybe? If you raise your arms just slightly the entire shirt lifts up oddly. I think I’m going to return it and try another.
3.0,"Seam around collar was torn. I'll be returning for exchange or refund. I'm 6""1 & the sleeves are a little short for me."
3.0,I didn’t like how the lace would show though my t-shirts. It was too small. I returned
3.0,These recovery flip flops were great. They were comfortable and fit great but not worth the money. They lasted me less than a year and the strap broke on them. I sent Hoka a picture of what occured and they never respond. I would like to send them back for repair or maybe they can design a  better strap.
3.0,"The arm holes are enormous!!!! So much so that I had to sew them before I wore it. Also this definitely runs big. However, not a bad cheap summer dress for the price. It's soft and cute."
3.0,very cute tank and worked for what I needed it for. I wasn't thrilled with the cut of the straps though and ended up using double sided tape to hold them in place- that's my only drawback on it.
3.0,I liked the concept and my daughter wears it sometimes but it will ruin her hairstyle once she takes off the hat. She won’t care to fix her hair after the fact so I’m giving it 3 stars. However it is very cute and darling when worn.
3.0,"Nice, but the material is cheap and thin."
3.0,Great quality and keeps you warm. But they sent me the wrong size I had ordered and now I have to return it for a smaller size. This was a gift so that’s a bit frustrating.
3.0,"Ok, would not order again."
3.0,"liked the idea and picture, but thought it poor quality and smaller than I ad hoped"
3.0,I liked the fact the sunglasses were lite and comfortable for work but the right lens began to pop off after a month.
3.0,"It fit a lot larger than I expected,  they weren't kidding that it's a loose fit. I'm 6' 220lb and normally wear xl, but could have gone down to just L. Colors bled during the first couple soaks, some white spots on the sleeves turned pink (bought red shirt).<br />Overall it was a comfy shirt that fit a luau themed party, but I won't be anxious to find another reason to wear it."
3.0,Es para proteger del sol
3.0,Very pretty but no way to shorten. Not meant for petite person
3.0,The fabric is really really nice on this dress .it's just like picture but it's really long the skirt other than that fine.
3.0,buttons arent attached well. one fell just by unpacking it. other buttons are barely on there.
3.0,"These are cute, but they run small. If you need arch support, you will probably want to get some inserts."
3.0,"Initially, I loved this wallet. I attached my keys to the strap--it was perfect because I could have my keys/ID/credit cards/iPhone 5 all in one place--exactly what I needed. But then the flimsy metal attachment for the strap broke off. I figured it was my fault for putting keys on it. I bought another one, and the metal attachment broke almost right away, so it's pretty useless as a wristlet and looks stupid as a wallet with the strap hanging off it. (The strap, leather construction, and RFID protection were why I bought it in the first place.) Other than the strap, it's well made and nice looking. I paid $40+ for my first one; I'm guessing the price has dropped so much because of the poor quality and  increased competition for RFID wallets. (There were very few to choose from 3 years ago.) Such a disappointment. I would buy another one in a heartbeat if they fixed the strap issue.."
3.0,Runs small but is stretchy.  Colors are exactly as shown.<br /><br />Would have been a better fit for a 1xl.
3.0,Fit was more of junior-sized than adult-sized.
3.0,"Quality was fine but wowwww was this dress short. The fit was tight but it is marketed as bodycon so that was expected, ordered a size up (XL) and it worked. Gave it away to a shorter friend with a similar body type and it looked great on her (I’m 5’9” she is roughly 5’6”)"
3.0,"Fun, lightweight clip ons, but they are not three dimensional, but are flat. I bought another pair years ago in Paris and they were the actual 3-D shape which I loved!"
3.0,More a-symmetrical than I would have liked.
3.0,This mask is very large… therefore it doesn’t fit well at all.
3.0,"Have to say I love the way these fit and look, definitely not the sturdiest material, but pretty decent for the price. I workout pretty extensively, about three hours a day and a lot of kickboxing, yoga, and long distance running, and these definitely wouldnt hold up to my workouts unfortunately. So if youre looking for a solid pair of workout leggings these are not for you, however if you just want a cute pair of comfortable leggings then these are great👍🏼"
3.0,The design is beautiful but this is not for a normal sized adult.
3.0,"Great item, just runs small"
3.0,"I like the overall appearance of the boots and the zippers make them super easy to put on my squirmy toddler, but the drawstring broke on the first use."
3.0,"Pretty little dress, but it is much more a peach color not champagne, both buttons were broken & off the dress. Bow appears to be glued not sewn to pin so I doubt it will last long. But it’s what I expect from a dress under $30. Might be good for dress up play but not for the flower girl dress we were hoping for ."
3.0,"Fabric was not the best but was OK.  Completely see thru so you would need some sort of undergarments which would be hot to wear unless cool ambient temp; from a season perspective, probably best worn in fall or winter (in more temperate climates).  Sizing runs slightly small, hitting about  the knee.  Not sure if it's the style or the proportions, but this dress looked matronly worn, not really for me.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,Fit is OK. Brought for vacation.
3.0,Ok watch for the money
3.0,very good bags but it is to small expedited it to be bigger
3.0,Material is very thick and scratchy but the design is awesome.
3.0,I’m 5’9 and this dress is a bit short on me it comes to my ankles which was disappointing. Very stretchy and true to size though.
3.0,SORRY BUT I HAVE A  QUEST5ION------I BOUGHT  ONE ONF  OF THESE OR LOOKED SAME-----AND IT WAS DEAD -----ARE THESE CURRENT WORKING  WATCHS ?  L do not want another  one that is dead .
3.0,It’s a pretty skirt very well made but runs super small I ordered a 2xl it was more like a large
3.0,"They are comfortable however, the shorts are way to short they look longer on the picture."
3.0,"I thought this would be like my other 'mens / women's' glasses Ive gotten but these just seem a touch too small, maybe because these are rimless, maybe they're not aviators, not sure, but I feel silly wearing them. Ill give them to my wife."
3.0,The fabric is very uncomfortable on the skin
3.0,Beautiful jacket but order one size up. Mine arrived medium and it’s too tight. I usually wear small and xsmall coats.
3.0,Bra part too small.
3.0,The lace is a bit scratchy and the waist was too high. I had to tailor it.
3.0,"I bought the grey one first, and loved it so much I bought the red one. Was disappointed with the thin material of the red one. Why different materials? Still love the fit."
3.0,"So this looks just like the picture (I got the lime green one) and it seems like the quality is actually really good but it runs small. I'm 5'4'' and about 110 lbs so I ordered a small but it's definitely too small. I probably could have worn this when I was in middle school! I'm only giving it 3 stars because the size is so off, so be sure to order up if you're normally a size small! Otherwise, it's cute. Very bright and fun."
3.0,Although it was a good idea for me it was uncomfortable.
3.0,"Very, ver, very thin. Used my own chain. Don’t think I would have bought if I had realized just how thin it would be."
3.0,"I have to admit, I had high expectations for these pajamas. When I receive them I was disappointed. I wash them before I wore them and they actually lost color in that first wash. I’d say 20% of their color they lost"
3.0,IT'S OK  BUT COULD BETTER . THE FOCUS PART OF IT IS GOOD. BUT IT'S CHEAPLY MADE AND CAN BREAK IF NOT CAREFUL
3.0,"Nothing on this item has the spanks logo on it, it is not a spanks item. It is a cute suit, a little smaller than expected."
3.0,This shirt is cute but shiny unlike the picture.
3.0,"So I got these because it says they’re hypoallergenic. I am allergic to nickel- so I thought these were cute and not a bad price so I bought them. About 2-3 days after wearing them, my ears started itching. There was some crustiness from my ear, but the earring didn’t tarnish. So I’m returning them. Also, they sit far off the ear— kinda like gauges and they’re heavy so they angle down. I like the concept & the design is cute. But if it were shorter and ACTUALLY hypoallergenic then this would’ve been a good buy."
3.0,"I ordered size 14/16 for my niece who is very tall and skinny. However, the shirt I would say is barely like a size 10. It's a shame because I know she would have liked the design."
3.0,The dimensions for the thigh area are too large for my legs. I'm in debate if I want to send this item back to the seller.
3.0,The photo in the middle is not this bold. Doable. Soft fabric
3.0,"I love the style and color, I just wish it had more UV protection."
3.0,Fit weird. Nice concept but wasn’t right if your small chested
3.0,"I got these for my mom and she loved the design. She also said they are kind of comfortable.<br />Little caution while walking, these shoes are very high! I guess is a good deal."
3.0,The item is as described by seller.
3.0,Nice but nit as blue as picture
3.0,"Good purse...but my problem is, the chemical smell...I don't like the smell..."
3.0,"First of all, I wanted a cotton robe for the winter.  I love the hood and the fit was great.  I washed it according to manufactures recommendation.  The robe had several areas where it frayed.  The pockets were the worst area for fraying, and along the bottom hem there was fraying as well.  I know cotton may fray, however I feel as though the workmanship was not all that great.  I would not recommend if  you want a perfect product. It will work to keep me toasty on cold winter mornings, so I just trimmed the fraying fabric off.  I give it a C letter grade."
3.0,I like the design it just feels a bit cheap and I feel like its a little on the short side
3.0,still too tight for XXL
3.0,"This is a cute shirt but the sizing is not correct. I ordered an XXL, which should have been very loose on me. What I got was more like a Large. Sadly I had to return it."
3.0,These sizes are off. I ordered 3 different sizes for my 3 kids and one fit huge and one fit small. It’s a gamble. Also I have boys and there’s no underwear netting in it. It’s just swim suit spandex. Which is ok but just cheaply made.
3.0,Just ok. Very bulky.
3.0,These socks are ok...the delivery was terrible and the agents I talked to BAD
3.0,The backs don’t stay on very well so I lost a lot fast
3.0,"Good, but size didn't fit the specs!"
3.0,So I thought this was cut w two layers of fabric.  it is not - it is a print.  but it is cut well for curvy people.  So that is a bonus.
3.0,Decent hat. Rose is a decoy not embroidery. Looks like it will crack and chip if washed.
3.0,"Loved the medallion and put it on my dog's collar the day it arrived.  All was good for about a week. Then I was playing around with the dog in my bed and when I got up something medal fell to the ground.  Sure enough it was the medallion. The ring at the top of the medallion had broken off.  At least it happened at home instead of at the dog park.<br />We fixed the problem by drilling a small hole through the medallion then putting it on the dog's collar by sharing a clip ring from her license.  We are very happy we figured out a workable solution.<br />So while we would probably purchase this medallion again, people should be aware that there is a problem with it. The medal it’s made from is soft and the top ring can easily break off. Price wish, it’s worth the risk and we love that our dog is being watched over by these Saints."
3.0,If a woman wears them the skulls are upside down bummer
3.0,I own several wallets and bags of this brand but this wallet seems like any other wallet you can get in a department store. You can barely read the name of the brand in the front part.
3.0,Pants are nice but too small.
3.0,These are really beautiful and seem very well made. They're just super tiny. I can't imagine any nipples fitting in them!!!
3.0,"The charms are nice, but the quality is poor. The prongs that hold some of the rhinestone to the settings are not strong or secured well and as result you’re left with an empty charm. Fortunately, only about two charms can with the rhinestone diamond setting so I didn’t return the order, but I won’t be purchasing these again."
3.0,Does not stay attached
3.0,I returned this product.  The color was very dusty...I was hoping for more pink.
3.0,Hat is a great fit and typical sizing. Logo IS NOT embroidered though.
3.0,iPad tote fashionable pretty cool
3.0,"The product just didn't fit me in a comfortable way. With the insoles in, I couldn't get my feet in. With the insoles out, the interior surface was textured and uncomfortable, plus they were slightly loose. The arch support was very agressive. The shoes were well made and very handsome otherwise. I sent them back."
3.0,The front is a little too small to cover fully a sports bra. Awkward fit in the front but comfy fit.
3.0,The watch is beautiful however if you have skinny wrist. You are gonna need to take some links out.
3.0,"I really like the shirt and its style but I couldn't see myself in it, I didn't like how it fit me.<br />I know people who have this item and are happy with it.<br />Certain clothing's are not for everyone but at least I bought it and tried it on,<br />I had to return the item but if it looked good on me I would have kept it without a doubt!"
3.0,"cute, but chain was broken when arrived. Clock is working, however. Package looked like it had been through alot."
3.0,The dress was cute and the material was nice but it wasn't flattering on my figure. I'm not slim nor do I have curves so it kinda just hung on me.
3.0,I ordered these in a size smaller than I usually would and they sent me my normal size. Really needed a 6<br /><br />Quality is questionable but they are very cute and comfortable
3.0,"Pretty cute, but unfortunately I am a plus size woman and it did not fit my frame comfortably. I think if you're not especially broad in the shoulders like I am, it'll be fine."
3.0,"Not what I expected. Would be better in a softer material. Didn't feel they were ""cooling"" as advertised."
3.0,"I usually wear a large or an XL in shorts. I went ahead and ordered a XXL on these and they barely fit. I was hoping for a tight fit on the inner liner and a loose fitting short, but they are both skin tight. Be careful when ordering."
3.0,I ordered the burgundy scarf but in reality it’s a dark red color. I have a gray one that I love but I needed a pop of color for an evening wedding and red won’t work. I’ll be returning it.
3.0,Not as great as I thought hint go bigger
3.0,"This piece is super sexy. Unfortunately, this XL was smaller than a previously purchase XL (in different color) The straps are 2-3&#34; shorter than my first order, making for some wierd bunching in the back. I am sending this back:/"
3.0,"Did not glow in dark, but pretty."
3.0,I'm not sure if I got a used item but the inside product tag was cut. The seam where the cut tag is located is incredibly itchy and irradiating to my skin. It's a cheap bra and it feels like it to me. Not super supportive.
3.0,Says high support but nope
3.0,"The earrings were shipped by themselves in a huge &#34;plastic&#34; envelope with no padding.  The earring backs are so small you can't hardly get your fingers on them.  Overall, I guess they are ok, but I'd never buy them again."
3.0,Sizes were much smaller than what I expected.
3.0,"I am a small woman who bought these to help with aftereffects of an elbow injury. These are very comfortable-- there isn't a vertical seam or anything that pinches, and help a lot with my elbow pain. My one concern is that these are slightly tight at the upper arm. Given that these are one size fits all, I'm not sure how well they'll fit larger arms, although there seems to be a consensus of a general good fit. Hopefully they'll loosen a bit as I wear them more."
3.0,Only issue was color<br />They are Grey not off black  nor like the picture
3.0,I should have gotten large
3.0,I love the look on her. My arms and chest are bigger then my waist and hips and couldn’t get the right fit. Shipping twice with no success was a bummer
3.0,Not as soft asni was hoping for the sleeves were way too lose didnt keep i returned it
3.0,"I like these. Nice material. I have to pull them up often and my butt looks ok. I prefer the large over the medium, I’m 5’2” and 170#.  I was slightly disappointed with the company. I bought a total of six pieces. Got a “Lucky Card” winner in three of the packages. Contacted them and they would only validate 1.<br />Good luck to whoever follows through and gets a $10 gift card or an extra pair of clothing."
3.0,this piece was exactly what i ordered. nothing too fancy. again with this piece the stone was a bit loose but didnt fall out like the others.
3.0,This is my 2nd pair of Kenneth Cole wedges. Can't go wrong with comfy AND cute!<br /><br />Update: I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars. This shows and comfy and cute. BUT the elastic attached to the buckle wears/stretched out in a matter of about 2 months. For the las couple of weeks I've noticed my left shoe makes more noise when I take each step. Today I looked at my shoe and the wedge is coming apart from the piece of the shoe where my foot goes. Barely 4 months old and they need to be trashed already. Pretty disappointed.
3.0,It is not my favorite....it is a nice simple dress.  Nothing overly great.  It's just ok.
3.0,"There are dents in it where the clasp grips, this is by design but sadly there are not enough so I can't get a good fit on my wrist. I thought it would be able to be set anywhere but this is not the case. It's the same has having a regular band with holes. You can clamp it down in other places but it will slip."
3.0,Nice color and very comfy. But a little too baggy on me.
3.0,"I ordered a size 11 thinking the silicone would eventually stretch. The rings were too small so I sent a message to the seller and let them know the issue and I would need a size 12,  they responded after a few days and assured me I would receive a replacement set in size 12 at no charge. The replacement set was another size 11 so the issue was not resolved and when I replied to let them know I have never gotten a response. So overall I believe the product is quality but not really enthusiastic about the customer service."
3.0,"Not exactlly what I thought, but they work."
3.0,Cute but thin fabric...more of summer pant
3.0,"Beautiful watchband, but the holes do stretch out and fray after a few days leaving it a loose fit."
3.0,"These leggings are overall nice but the fit is just awful, theta re tight in my waist and hips, and super loose on my knees, they look ridiculous.<br />I'll have to cut and stitch them so they look a bit better"
3.0,"i purchased a black cropped version of this and loved it so i  decided to buy a second one in blue  but the longer version. I  opened it  and it smelled so bad, worse than curry or sage put together.  i had to return"
3.0,high waisted and unflattering small opening for legs
3.0,Odd fit and I didn’t love the wine color.
3.0,Not as flowy as shown on model.
3.0,i was a little disappointed in the quality. it looks more like a costume than a classy jumpsuit but maybe its just not for me
3.0,Not great fit
3.0,"I like how this look. it's very pretty with the extra detail.  The only reason why i didn't give 5 star is because it arrived with the hoop for the button broken.  it is something that can be fixed, but just wish it arrived ready to wear."
3.0,"I want to start with this is a great set for the price and does look like the pictures. I bought this set for my bachelorette party and will definitely use it. However, the shorts go all the way up to my under-boob and are about mid-thigh length. I am 5'4"" and I bought the small. I do have a shorter torso but my legs are very long for my height so for them to be so long is strange. I will be wearing them for my bachelorette but will be rolling the waist band to make them fit perfectly."
3.0,there are tight on the ankles
3.0,"VERY long and the material is not great - thin and see-throughish. Perfect for a tall, slim giant which I am not!"
3.0,"the polish seems to be fine.  however, the applicator makes it very difficult to get the top part of the sole."
3.0,They are pretty in appearance but disappointing in function. They do not stay clasped.
3.0,Very nice just smaller than expected
3.0,"Low quality, but I bought out for its novelty so not unexpected. It fit the purpose."
3.0,"These are advertised as easy to put on, but, they are NOT, just as hard to put on as any other compression socks."
3.0,its holding up well to daily use but the ID window on it(at least on mine) is REALLY tight and its hard to get my ID out when i need it. i basically have to force it out of the ID pocket
3.0,"Nice fit, but the design looks like a female private part."
3.0,Unless you like the underboob thing.
3.0,"This little dress fits well, but the fabric feels really cheap & thin. The pockets are ok, not deep enough though. I will keep it because it looks like casual Friday on the Enterprise D in Star Trek TNG. I will have some fun with it for Halloween."
3.0,"Order a size down. I bought it and it was way too large. I didnt feel like returning it so I used safety pins to bring the size in. Worked like a charm. And then i got pregnant sooooooooo I only wore it twice. Its a good product. I recommend it, just order down."
3.0,"love the slim fit narrower size as I am petite female.  The online picture and the actual color of the item received were quite different:  No white/beige in the buff received, only gray and dark grey.  I wasn't thrilled with the darker color as I purchased this item for a trip to the tropics to protect my neck from the sun post surgery.  The darker than expected colors were a little warm.  Edges also curl up.  Dries quickly after washing.  But all in all it does the trick.  I will purchase another."
3.0,This dress was way too short for me (I’m 5’5). I was bummed because the print is so pretty! May be able to wear with leggings and boots for the winter months. I got a medium (~175lbs) and It was still very big. Could’ve been fine with a small!
3.0,"This jacket was so soft; I really wanted it to fit.  It was too small across the back and at the shoulders.  I couldn't put my arms out in front of me, and I did measure carefully.  If you order, order up a size.  I also did not like that it fell just below the hips which made me look a bit like a green snowball.  I decided to return it and got something longer.  I do wish it had fit because the color and texture were really great."
3.0,"It’s cute but way too simple in material, looks good but it’s too soft doesn’t really do anything other then the look (very thin material, no compression at all)"
3.0,"i'm a 36 chest and based on sizing chart i ordered a large. the girls played peekaboo thru the arm openings. had to pin the area in a way that didn't look... pinned. otherwise, the length and the material are just fine. i ordered 2 other colors in a large. i'm exchanging them for medium. hope my review is helpful."
3.0,"Ugh! I love this dress, I do! But like everyone else has mentioned it is WAYYY too short. Any sudden movement and your butt is literally showing from the holes! This dress would have been PERFECT if it the opaque part of the dress was at least 5 inches longer.. I’m so sad :("
3.0,"These gem stones earrings look bigger on the photo, the stones are so small not at all like they are shown & if you have long hair you can't even see them  not worth the money."
3.0,"Like most of the replacement bands this one is very short compared to the bands on new watches.  This one barely fits and, of course, the last 2 holes are unusable because the tail of the strap won't tuck into the retainer.  I'm on hole 2 an have large but boney wrists.  If your wrists are much more than 8&#34; around the band will be uncomfortably snug.  Not that I've found any longer bands..."
3.0,"The ""gold"" is the ugliest gold I have ever seen. Will keep them and clip off the findings and replace them with some findings I have in my stockpile."
3.0,Not quite as I expected but they worked out okay
3.0,"It looks so pretty in the photos, but it’s not that pretty. The material is nice though."
3.0,"I bought these to upgrade from a pair of lined bifocal clear on top as I like wearing them all the time instead of taking glasses on and off but these have a ""computer blue block"" in the center and it makes them blurry Instead of clear for regular wear Above the magnification."
3.0,They are way too long.
3.0,"It has a tag on it that says Not Safe For Children Under 14. Why wasn't this noted on the webpage. I put it on my 5 year old just long enough to take a picture. It hangs as artwork now, not jewelry. Great message; poor execution."
3.0,i over all like the product i just think that because its silver plated instead of it just being silver that i have already had some chipping flaking off. i hope that it doesn't turn
3.0,The masks are slightly small but are great to out in... I didn’t use this visor . I combine the face mask with a face shield..
3.0,"I got the blue tie-dye version and in the listing pictures there isn't a seam up the front, but in reality there is a seam and the tie-dye pattern doesn't line up. I like the fit and feel okay so I kept it, but the photos are misleading."
3.0,Too tight in the busy. The cut was weird and waist didn’t fall in a flattering position for my body. Snug in the arms. Fabric was soft AMS stretchy though.
3.0,good for pictures only. opened it twice and still hasn't broken on me so i guess<br />it's good
3.0,"Good enough for the price. A lot of static that wouldn’t go away, fabric is ok but could be better and the print is a bit fuzzy. Otherwise decent enough. Probably would’ve kept if there wasn’t so much static and the fabric was better."
3.0,cheap but good for work socks!!
3.0,Do not like material.
3.0,Not as volumeous as I was expecting. It was also longer than I was anticipating.
3.0,"Some of the socks fit good, and LOVE the bright colors.  Other socks were too small (on the ankle part), and had to throw them away.  VERY disappointed!"
3.0,I got a size Large; 134lbs 34D 5’6 normally I am between size 4 - 6 and it was way too big. Should have ordered a medium. Nice material though.
3.0,Pretty but the chain rubs and is not as long as it says.
3.0,"The  3 grandaughter loves  them , but I think they look very cheap ,, I hope they hold up .."
3.0,"I was hoping this shirt would have more of the trendy, youthful vibe as it looks in the picture but unfortunately it does not.  The material is thick and reminds me a lot of nursing scrubs/uniforms.  It just looks like something that an older woman would wear.  The fit is OK, it looks a little too boxy on me to wear over jeans or leggings but it does work well tucked into a high wasted pencil skirt or something similar.  The one thing I do really like about it is the color.  I chose the coral which is a beautiful, vibrant peachy color.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion."
3.0,"I love how cute this watch band is, but it keeps coming un buckled. It also is a very stiff band."
3.0,"Beautiful necklace.  Chain was too short, even with the extension."
3.0,I love the twisted strap but it does run small and short
3.0,This dress is much longer than expected. I am 5 ft 2. It goes past my needs. I have to get it hemmed. The material is a nice quality and I have no other complaints besides the length.
3.0,"I liked very much your handbag: leather, design, size. I have only disagreed with color because I ordered a red handbag and you dispatched a fuscia color one. This is a very important matter because I selected a red color handbag. Now I can't do anything since I am unable to buy a red one, in case you really have that color in stock."
3.0,"These are super cute, but I am 5’9 and 175, I typically wear a 12. I ordered a large and I’d have been lucky to get one thigh in them. My daughter, who is 19 and weighs 115 is wearing them and they fit her perfectly. Sizing is juniors for sure."
3.0,It’s worth what I paid for it
3.0,"My dautgher is almost 10 years old, the raincoat is big enough but the covershoes is to small, she has too much difficult to put those. It's sad because the quality seems good."
3.0,The shorts labeled light gray are NOT light gray! They are DARK gray.
3.0,It's kind of hard to get on.  It was a gift and she loved it.
3.0,I usually wear a small but since the reviews said it runs small I got a medium. The pajamas were still to small.
3.0,The silver necklace seemed to be just a gold color that was painted over in silver. The charms were yellowed around the edges
3.0,"3 stars for the material and the endurance. It was cheap and felt like shower curtains I have purchased in the past. I sized up to an XL but I probably could have stood to get a large, the chest was wayyy to baggy and since it is super low cut - if you have a larger chest, your bits will hang out.  So I pinned it. It's also not a dress to bend over in. The overall look was flattering and cute. You'll need to steam it because it will get wrinkly. It also smelled coming out of the package but all these clothes do, so wash it, and AIR DRY. HOWEVER, after the second wash now, on delicate setting with low agitation, the entire thing has threads hanging all over it. I'll add more photos later."
3.0,"Way short but it’s nice material, wear black underneath. I got a large so it could be longer but it’s still short"
3.0,Very big. I had to return it.
3.0,"Hand wash only; do not put in dryer! Not made to last, but incredibly comfortable and not terribly ugly! I love the colors."
3.0,Don't think I would order this again
3.0,"The two stones match (which is not always guaranteed with inexpensive mail-order jewelry), but the size is tiny. They barely qualify as 3mm if you measure widest point, including the setting. Still, a good deal for the price."
3.0,Thinker than the claimed thickness. Going back.
3.0,Love the style but it runs tight in the shoulders and arms and is short in the length even for someone like me with a short torso.
3.0,"Fits tight against face.  Designed for teenager face, not adult.  Uncomfortable and hot to wear for more than about 15 minutes.  Good news is it should be protective with the four layers and snug fit."
3.0,"On trying on, I noted stiching is not tight.  The stitching of the loop for connecting the gloves on one glove missed the fabric loop.  The loop literally came off with no use.  The quality of the glove is about what you would get from a grocery store."
3.0,Love the dress but way too fitted.
3.0,"This is a very large bracelet, was even too large for my boyfriends wrist. Then after no more than a week the elastic broke. I am planning on re-stringing it and making it smaller. Just be aware that the diameter is large and the beads are pretty large as well."
3.0,"So I bought these leggings because I’m 4’10” and wanted a pair that wouldn’t be long on me. The 22 inch inseam reaches juuust above my ankle, so no complaints there. They’re also pretty thick and don’t rip when I have to pull them up.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I ordered my size according to the size chart. Since I have a 30 inch waist, I ordered a large. I’m not sure if I should have sized down but these leggings annoy the heck out of me. They constantly sag, which is NOT optimal for exercise. Even if I don’t exercise, I have to hike them up every time I stand. I’ve never had this issue with leggings before.<br /><br />So my advice is to size down if you’re going to buy these. No one likes leggings that don’t stay put."
3.0,"I NORMALLY WEAR EXTRA LARGE OR SIZE 16. THIS SHIRT APPEARED ON SITE TO BE TYPE I USUALLY WEAR. THE V NECK IS CUT TOO LOW, IT FITS TIGHT INSTEAD OF BLOUSY. NOT WORTH SENDING BACK BUT  I DON'T LIKE THE FIT."
3.0,"Lanyard is attractive and will carry a nametag, door fob and three keys without the magnetic clasp coming loose too often, but after just shy of 6 months of use, the wire came unbound.  I was standing in the copy room at work, when suddenly all the beads on one half of the lanyard were bouncing down onto the floor. Also, after approximately four months of use the magnetic clasp turned a copper color (it was originally silver toned). The magnetic clasp was wonderful in function. I have a very bad habit of locking and unlocking my door at work with a key attached to a lanyard around my neck.  Before I bought this one, I had a plain nylon lanyard and just about had my head removed when a janitor jerked the door open while I was trying to lock it from the inside. After that incident I decided a magnetic closure was a must.  I'm very disappointed that this one lasted such a short time before breaking."
3.0,XL feels like a medium
3.0,But initially has two holes in the seam of the right leg inner and outter
3.0,"I wanted to like it, but it’s very cheaply made and it shows. The fabric does not stretch hardly at all, even with the smocking in the back. If you’re at all busty, skip this one. The design itself is amazing, but the material and execution are disappointing."
3.0,the veil portion required an adjustment as it was like lace bangs instead of falling over the eyes. but it was a great buy for the price and was fairly easy to adjust the veil by removing and reapplying with hot glue
3.0,"Runs large. I’m 5’3” 140 lbs and ordered a medium (my current standard size), and even for an over-sized fit, it feels too big in the shoulders. Would describe as a medium to light weight, slightly scratchy sweater.<br />*update*<br />After washing in cold and air drying, the sweater did shrink down to fit like a medium. However, needs more gentle care, bc the fabric now looks very worn and fuzzy after only one wash. Still scratchy. All in all, meh."
3.0,"It shipped relatively quickly for being out of the country. The chain ended up tarnishing, but the pendant appears to be good quality."
3.0,Smaller than I wanted.
3.0,The ran small!
3.0,I bought this product for protection but there is not filter on it. For pandemic use is not so protective
3.0,"I loved the idea and the shape was true to the picture, however, the earrings were extremely small and the screwback hole was even smaller. I was unable to place the earrings in her the entire Disney Trip! I was slightly disappointed because they were purchased as a gift."
3.0,"Very,very cute but the straps are extremely flimsy and don't fasten properly, I had to use little Velcro stickies to make them work."
3.0,Not crazy about the design in person.  Rather bulky in appearance.  Cats-eye glasses they're not.
3.0,"The style is nice and it fits generally fine, it is just a little tight in the arms (I don't have very lean arms however). I have only worn it twice and I noticed that the stitching is already coming apart significantly in the sleeve ends (the cuff area). That is why I'm disappointed. I am going to keep it and just repair it with some sewing myself. It was not an expensive shirt and I still like it enough to keep it."
3.0,This blouse is nice quality but the pattern is much larger than it looks in the photo. I bought it as a gift for a very petite woman and it would not have looked good on her so I kept it for myself.
3.0,Make sure you have a backing or else they will fall out .
3.0,"good vibrant color, however it was smaller than what I thought... and there was a very strong smell to it... its sitting in my closet while it airs out... : |"
3.0,"The picture makes the bathing suit look really nice. The one I received did not fit the same way exactly. Thought it was the right size, the top just seemed a bit awkward. It doesn't give you the cleavage as it shows and it cuts into your chest. The straps that go up seemed off, like it wasn't as nice as in the picture, not as clean cut if that makes sense, made certain areas slightly baggy. I love the bottoms though and would wear it with my other bathing suit tops. Don't think I would wear the top of this one. Good thing it wasn't expensive. Worth trying."
3.0,"The skirt was not as high waisted as it appeared to be in the pics.  In addition, it was a little too loose in the waist. I will either need to have it taken up or add a belt.  Also, I wish they would have taken a little more care with the stitching. It seems like it was rushed in some areas causing the skirt not to hang properly. I was, however, pleased with the quality of the fabric."
3.0,It’s pretty but doesn’t fit me or fit as stated so order up a size or two. They have another design that fits better and is just as nice.
3.0,the material is good but the front is too short and the back is too long
3.0,I had high hopes for these as house slippers. I’m a size 9 I bought the 9-10. They fit like a tight 9. I wanted to like them so much I wore them in the house and cannot return. Interior of slipper is not roomy for toes. So sad I wasted my money on overpriced clown shoes!<br /><br />Update: after a break in period I was able to wear them. I really wanted them for comfort and walking in the wet grass in the morning when walking my dogs. First let me say that they are not cushy and have zero support but are warm. Second size up.  My size 9-10 was a tight 9 but are wearable after break in and I’m a 9. 3rd : they are still overpriced plastic clown shoes but are serving there purpose. I would not recommend them. Beware they make your feet smell and The lining is not removable. You have to pull it out and wash while attached to slipper. Not exactly easy to do. So I still stand with my generous 3 star review. They are not worth the price. I rarely write reviews but don’t want anyone else to make the same mistake.  This is an honest and accurate review.
3.0,Bought for my daughter.  Should of went a size smaller.  Runs big/long..  Cute though..
3.0,"Very pretty but see thru and I cant wear as it is about a size 16, not a 3x. Wasn't too happy about that."
3.0,They look awesome except they are really big on your face and they dont sit straight.  The Director ones are much smaller
3.0,This  is ok. Its good for my 8 yr old. Sturdy & good looking enough. No big deal. Just ok.
3.0,cant really play with the fidget without using both hands.  I like to play with it on the same hand it is on!  Not sure If I should keep it or not!
3.0,"This would have been the perfect tanks but I wished it fitted a bit tighter. I got a small but it was a bit too big for my liking. I like tanks to fit body tight and I thought these would be it. But other than that, it’s soft stretchy and comfy  just wished they made it tight fitting or had an XS option."
3.0,"Looks great! Good quality! Fits a little smaller than expected, plenty big but a little shallow."
3.0,"Great set, but runs very small, and I am 5”9 and way to long...had to take them off so I would trip on them..."
3.0,Shirt fits just about actual size though neck is a little wide. Shorts are too short and not ideal for boys.
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, but ordered this in an XL based on reviews and the sizing chart. It's comically big--I probably should have ordered a large or even my regular size medium. It hangs past my knees (I'm 5'5&#34;) and the sleeves are too long. The pockets aren't very helpful, because I can barely reach them (maybe I have short arms? But we're not talking t-rex proportions, I should be able to reach my own pockets!) The shoulder seams are almost to my elbows.<br /><br />But it would be too expensive to exchange. I have been wearing it around the house as a robe/ loungewear, and it's comfortable enough. With the length, it's like wearing a blanket! And I like the colors (matches everything) and the stripe across the back adds a little interest. The fabric is a bit itchy, though. It's really warm, but not as cozy as it would be in softer fabric."
3.0,"We bought these for my son's Mickey Mouse Halloween costume and had to send back the first pair, as they were entirely too small! we orderd 1.5 sizes larger and could have gone bigger. They're very small and narrow. They are absolutely adorable and once we got the size bigger in, they were great with the outfit, but I would not recommend them for daily wear, especially when a lot of walking is being done."
3.0,"I usually wear a 4, and I am pear shaped. I am 5' and 125 lbs. I ordered a small. while it is enormous and long on the top of the bodice, it is also much more open than what is pictured. The top is really indecent without an undershirt of some sort.  The length would have been fine with a 3-4 inch heel, which is what I expected."
3.0,Mangas iguales a las fotos
3.0,cute but metal detail on arms catches hair and OUCH!
3.0,My 17month currently wears 2T however this is quite big for her... it's cute but i'm giving her a few more months for it to be a better fit..
3.0,Great purse besides the zippers break off super easy.
3.0,I wear a 42c in every bra I have and this one was small.
3.0,"I ordered the Eco Black, the item arrived really quickly and it's okay  but it is not even close to being black, it's a charcoal grey with almost white flecks throughout. It's soft (think thin soft flannel PJ's), and I don't think of it as oversized at all; it's a decent size and I'm a scarf lover, quality is okay so I'll keep it but definitely not what I thought I was getting. I don't think I'll order anymore of their  products and I had planned to purchase a couple more scarves had I really liked this one. In fairness to the company, the color in the pic is pretty accurate, they should just say it's charcoal grey and not black."
3.0,"This dress is quite boxier than pictured. I have a small chest and waist measurement to hip, so I knew choosing this style would be tricky. I have a 14 inch difference between waist and hips, so in order to have room to move I had to go up a size. I ordered an XXL, but my bust and waist measurement could have used a L. I’ll have to have it taken in.<br />It would be VERY helpful to include hip measurements for customers. I could have ordered a size down at least. I need the dress for an event Saturday so I’ll just have to belt the waist and use a pin on the bust."
3.0,"Boyshorts - no / tummy control - no / Gathers your breast together - no / modify your figure - no / High waist bikini bottom - yes / Flowy hem can conceal the tummy fat - no... there is no breast support... the ""flowing hem"" starts are 2/3rds of the way down the suit... the first 2/3rds is skin tight and then it flairs out.  Color is bright - pattern is fun... if you have the  slightest tummy bulge - this suit will accent it."
3.0,"I am 5'8&#34; tall and 135lbs. I wear a size 4 or 6 in your typical Calvin Klein jacket.  After reading other reviews I ordered an XXXL in this jacket.  The fit is perfect. I really like the length--very long. The fabric quality is okay but not great.<br /><br />The problem is the shoulders. They are a puffy, padded, pointy disaster. I can't stand it. I may order other jackets from this seller but I'll be very careful to take a close look at the shoulders first."
3.0,These masks are cute and decorative but simply to thin. They have only the front lining noting more.
3.0,"Like the style, however tight in the hip area. Should have sized up"
3.0,"Was pleased when it arrived- thick and sturdy, fit really well, etc. A month or two later, it still feels sturdy but the color is wearing off the belt. The belt can't be used for anything but a dirty work site, looking as poorly as it does. Bummer.<br /><br />*UPDATE* The seller reached out in response to my review and offered a new belt, felt the first one was an oddity. We've received it and are trying it out, will update if the color is more steadfast (upgraded two star to three star based on proactive Customer Service)."
3.0,Muy linda pero la estrella se desprendió el primer día que la usé
3.0,"Smaller than expected, and very cheaply made, you definitely get what you pay for here. However, it does its job as an apron, the pattern is still really cute and the pocket is very handy."
3.0,This is a Christmas gift so I do not know if it will fit yet.
3.0,Fit small.  Good look though.
3.0,"Although I ordered up a size,  this was way too small. They are well made with good fabric"
3.0,I’m 145lbs and 5’5” and it was too short for my liking. I love the fabric though!!
3.0,"This looked to be a very fun necklace, however, the chain was broken when it arrived.  I had to send it back."
3.0,It was beautiful but the chain is very small and would not fit around my neck.
3.0,Much duller color then the photo
3.0,The fit didn't lay on the body like the picture.  The sleeves were too big.
3.0,"I love the idea of these, but sometimes they are super uncomfortable to wear!  They are very difficult for me to use by myself and I almost always have to have my husband put them on for me."
3.0,"While these will surely provide some fun for grandchildren visits, as others have noted many lights do not work.  All come jumbled together loosely in a plastic bag and at some point probably turn themselves on and lose battery power.  Out of the 40 in the order, only 28 worked."
3.0,This “red” is more like pumpkin orange. The material is low quality and the sizing is smaller than normal. Order with caution.
3.0,"It is a pretty top, but the fabric is cheap. A seem in the sleeve tore the first time I wore it. It was easy to mend but I still prefer shirts that don't rip the first time I put them on."
3.0,"This dress fit nice, but it was not opaque enough for me in the white color.  I will try wearing it with leggins as maybe a longer tunic top - I've seen other people do that.  It's comfortable so either with leggins or just for at home.  I really like it other than that and another color would probably do really well."
3.0,Came squished like many others but that's not my problem. my problem is that it came with a terrible scent on it. I can't get close to the hat without feeling wheezy.
3.0,The pendent quality is great. It seems very sturdy and like it is an actual seal stamp. It is really cute but the chain is very thin. I do with the chain was a little thicker. I ordered mine and it said It would come in 01/10/20 and it was several days late. It didn’t even seem like it was shipped until until 01/12/20. I finally got it 01/14/20 around 6 ish at night through UPS.
3.0,Don’t like the Pom<br />Pom on them
3.0,"Feels really cheap. Joysticks are playstic so i had to buy grips for it. It doesnt have a headphone jack which is essential for when i play. Also, there is only 1 touch pad button and there are supposed to be 2 so it actually hinders gameplay on most games and there are a couple games that I can't play at all BC I cant perform the action BC of the touch paf"
3.0,It’s a great fabric and design but you need to order a size 3 times larger than what you normally wear.
3.0,Nice pieces but they were all too small for mg fingers
3.0,"I liked the dress and it fit ok but the buttons have elastic fasteners and with my arthritis, I wasn't able to fasten the dress."
3.0,"This is a nice looking shoe and I would love to have kept it.  Unfortunately the first pair I ordered (which was already a size up from my true size) was so small I could barely get my feet in.  I then ordered two sizes up and found the shoes too large, even with inserts.  What's more, once I could walk around in them, I realized they were too hard as I'm looking for something with a soft cushioned heel + arch support.<br /><br />I have found the Megnya sandals I ordered work quite well but they don't have any closed, dressier shoes so I had been hoping these would fit the bill."
3.0,The hammer is my... well the shirt is a shirt. Fair quality however the logo was huge. A lot bigger then shown in the picture. I certainly had the biggest Hammer at Comic Con.
3.0,I love this sweater. I bought and black and grey.<br />The second one came defective.
3.0,Dress Looks a lot cheaper in person
3.0,"The shoe looks great and fit great, but only issue was one shoe's LED's had one or two lights out and did not have a replacement in that same size and color. Other then that we had it taken care of with fast service and a helpful company."
3.0,I love this band! The only thing I have a problem with is that it does not keep the size you make it. It slips out of its original size easy.
3.0,"This is a nice cap.  It's decent looking, runner style and fits well.  It does sit a little high on the head, so if your head is more round, it may tend to ride up.  It's from Headsweats, but for someone that prespires heavily, this won't keep the sweat out of your eyes.  It's great for sun, light and if it's in the 60's and sunny - it's perfect.  If it's 80 and humid and you prespire a lot, you may need a halo band with this cap. I'm not disappointed, I just hoped for more absorbtion and help with keeping sweat out of the eyes."
3.0,They fell apart easy and cheap
3.0,Loved the material (T-shirt like) and design...bought my usual size and sleeves were way too long and bodice was very large in size! I recommend ordering a size down.
3.0,"Nice material, but runs very small."
3.0,It was very cute but way to small for me.
3.0,"Lower quality than I hoped for, but they were cheap and fun."
3.0,material was nice but very long.
3.0,It's pretty but Plus size wasn't too plus.  Can't send it back so will give it away
3.0,I soooo wanted to love this top because it is beautiful!...I wear a size 18 to 20 and I got the 4xl and the shoulder bust part was too small and the bottom too big and I'm not even that big chested...also very thin material
3.0,It came as cotton white & not cream. It's still pretty tho. Some loose threading but is fixable.
3.0,"The top barely covers my breasts. It’s very soft material, but I fear it will shrink and the top will not fit the bosom area. The bow is kind of annoying because it doesn’t stay put, it slips out. Very comfortable though. Just never going to wear in public."
3.0,I have 6 or 7 Jor thongs. All of them are size M. This one needs to be a L. I have a 30&#34; waist and I'm about 6' 3&#34;.
3.0,"These glasses came and were great, but after a couple weeks, these little circles started to appear in the mirror finish. I have already had to buy new glasses... I’m sad because I loved these"
3.0,"Design is cute.  I had expected a darker tone red and found the skirt part to be too short, not covering the buttocks."
3.0,Fit fine but needs more padding because it leaks in the corners
3.0,This is a quality jacket with a liner. Only problem is that it runs 1 to 2 sizes smaller than similar coats. I had to sent mine back since 3x was the largest size it came in. I really liked it but it was too small.
3.0,"Nice. Kind of wrinkles easily. Still cute, but a little short."
3.0,I like the shirt but when they said it was white I expected white. My shirt is more cream.
3.0,The back not as expected. I expected a cross back like in pictures. It's just a rope. Still fits but I expected the cross back. Soft comfy materials
3.0,The shirt was advertised as a sweatshirt. It does not have the fleece inside the shirt like most sweatshirts do. The size was accurate and the pattern was spot on. Just not what I expected as a sweatshirt.
3.0,It is very well made but a bit stiff.  End keeps flipping from the straps that hold it.
3.0,"I bought this for a friend for her b-day and ordered an XL for her.  When it arrived I held it up and thought ""no way will this fit her"", so I tried it on, and it fit ME!  (All who know me would say I did it on purpose so I could keep it, but it really wouldn't have fit her! LOL) I wear a size medium and it fits me the way I was wanting it to fit her - a little baggy to wear with leggings or whatnot.<br /><br />Also, it gets 3 stars because the writing on it is a little fuzzy/blurry. It's also see-through so you have to wear a tank top underneath. Other than that it's a cute shirt. Not perfect, but cute.<br /><br />(I had to get my friend something else)"
3.0,"They fit my 3 year old, but are too tight for my 7 year old."
3.0,"They’re comfortable. They’re soft and provide warmth. They come up to your ankles, which is great. They are too large for me, though. They would tend to fall off if I wore them to bed and felt a little loose when I was walking. That aside, the main thing is that they tended to shed little pieces. I would see little blue tufts through the floors in the house. I would say that the feeling of wearing them is nice. I haven’t had the pair very long and would’ve worn them more if they didn’t shed."
3.0,"don't like the silver, never wore it"
3.0,"For toddlers, I recommend getting mittens as my 4 year old son was not able to properly put on gloves and have any dexterity to play in snow.  I do not think it is the gloves but because I guess he was not ready for gloves and should wear mittens instead."
3.0,The bra cups are a terrible fit. The halter tie just doesn’t work and it make the top ill fitting.  The swim suit is not wearable I haven’t been able to wear it and I’m a medium busted woman.  It’s not well made at all.
3.0,The logo SLAYER was not clear. Some of the letters had the paper or adhesive still on it. Doesn't want to come off the logo. Priced was real good. Didn't want to send back overseas.
3.0,Too thick. Rolled up when putting on my shoes
3.0,Very pretty but not as warm as I hoped they would be.  Touchscreen actually works unlike other gloves I have purchased.
3.0,The color and length of the belt is as advertised.<br />The width is 1 & 3/16 inches (3.016 centimeters).<br />There's a kink (sharp bend) in the belt because it was mailed in a plastic bag.
3.0,Get the stripes.  The ripples are far less quality than the stripes.
3.0,This product was just okay for me the material quality was good. However the fit was not I was expecting even a different size would not have made a difference so I had to have it tailored for my body its great now.
3.0,It doesn’t fit well
3.0,"Its only actually silver plated, but still a cute necklace for the price."
3.0,"Good quality fabric and the sizing was perfect, however, the zipper broke immediately after i got it."
3.0,Makes clicking noise when I walk from inside the shoe. They didn’t run as small as everyone said
3.0,"I bought this for a gender reveal photo so I just needed it for decoration, not function. Its pretty thin and collapses easily on itself, if I was actually using this for function Im not sure how well it would hold up to a child wearing them and walking around."
3.0,"It is so cute.  I want to like it so much, but I can't get it on without hurting my ear."
3.0,"This worked for spirit week for elementary school, but not best quality. If you just need something simple it works though."
3.0,"It was cute enough but inexpensive material & the piping was shiny gold, which I didn't care for. The fit was good &ikes the v neck, just wasn't the look I was after."
3.0,Very small in size and looks cheaply made.
3.0,needed more slots for cards
3.0,Makes me look scary but its a good sun blocker
3.0,"Longer than I expected, but otherwise OK."
3.0,I guess it fits like the picture shows. I'm 5'5 and about 130lb. It was really big on me. I kinda expected it to be a tighter fit. But hey. It's a cute cover up. The material is a little thick for the summer
3.0,"Sizes run a little small. Other than that, a good gift."
3.0,I like it but it is wayyyy to large. I wear a large and ordered a large. Could have went with a medium
3.0,"This dress is pretty cute, but the flowers are placed a little different on the actual dress than on the model. The v neckline is only visable if I fold in one of the sides cause the slit is straight down, and I guess the model is showing it as thought one side is laying outward, but it doesnt lay that way on me. It is a little longer than I like, and undergarments show with how high the slit is. I like this dress, but I've fallen out of love after wearing it a couple times."
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter. The socks are cute, but very light weight, and ran on the small side."
3.0,Maybe my body type but its not a dress :(
3.0,"The item is exactly what it look like in the picture. However, mine didn't come with a zipper pull for the front pouch. Also, the zippers in general would get stuck more often than not. Hope this helps"
3.0,"It doesn’t look bad, I was going to return it but a dog made it dirty. As I said, it doesn’t look bad. The biggest thing is the waist is RIGHT under my boobs, I mean I’m 5’9 but RIGHT UNDER MY BOOBS??? As I said, it doesn’t look bad."
3.0,"Color doesn't quite match the deep green I wanted, closer to sky blue. But I'll keep it"
3.0,"These look fine, just plan on refastening when you bend over because it doesn't stay buckled."
3.0,Liked it until one of the letters came off. Don't know how. Just noticed one day. Now it says I INICAT.
3.0,I was happy with all of them except for the whale that was supposed to say dreamer. Mine just says Drea!<br />I bought these as secret santa gifts so I'm sure we'll be able to laugh about it but I'm little sad
3.0,Really cute but runs large.
3.0,Comfortable but noisy
3.0,"Didn’t receive the item I ordered. I ordered the silver/gold version; received the blk/gold version. I like it so am electing to not return however, please be more attentive to your order descriptions of your customers."
3.0,its nice but if your a female with a smaller wrist it may be to big.
3.0,"Wings are fantastic, but the ones I received have a manufacturing flaw - there's not a finger slot on the left wing (the right side has a loop, but the left does not).  I contacted the company to ask for new wings, but they offered a partial refund instead and suggested I fix them, which isn't ideal.  Yes, I could have returned them and ordered new wings, but I need the wings for an event and couldn't wait for that process to play out."
3.0,This dress was ok I bought it for a wedding that I was in but it was bigger than expected. I normally wear a size xl but I got a l and it was still big. it was ok but not what I thought it would look and feel like.
3.0,"I should have ordered a size up.<br />Dress is beautiful, the medium is just really tight."
3.0,Received cotton glove order today; but disappointed; expected Large size as described but looks & feels like Medium  (one size fits all).<br />Will be using to handle photo prints.
3.0,"The quality of this dress was very impressive. It has a slip attached so you cannot see through. The print was very pretty. The fit of the dress was a little large. However, I did not like the dress on my body. I did not feel like it flattered my figure."
3.0,These shirts were too small and the sleeves were too short for me. Had to return them. Colors and quality looked fine but just didn’t fit as I’d hoped.
3.0,Sheds.  A lot.  Quality is not there. It is warm though.
3.0,"Larger stone than expected, but rings look good"
3.0,"The package is a black small box just like a ring box but all square.  The rings are metallic looking but soft like the silicone wrist bands that were popular and still are today.  The colors are just as in the pictures... Black, silver, and dark grey which look like metal at first glance.  They are very pliable and can be stretched some but not without going back to their original size.  They do not get bigger after stretching and will break cleanly if stretched too much.  They are about 3/8 inch wide (0.9 cm) and this is a much wider ring than I have worn in the past.  The ring is flat on the inside and has a curved outer surface as most rings do.  The inside is slightly curved also but convex which makes it slightly tighter at the edges.  This slight tightness is somewhat irritating but this may be because these rings are 3 times the width of other rings I am familiar with.  My wife says, &#34;It feels better when worn inside out.&#34;<br />  I have not worn a wedding band for 20 years because of my job which requires frequent hand washing with removal of jewelry when needed.  I have had normal wedding bands but have lost or misplaced them over the years.  I was hoping that these silicone bands would be non-irritating and comfortable to wear but I have come to the conclusion that a ring on my finger is just irritating to me.  I was hoping these silicone bands would be so comfortable and inert that I would barely know they were there.  I can still tell that I have a ring on my finger which irritates me and I cannot get used to any ring at this time.<br />  I was given a discount for the purchase of this product in exchange for this review.  I do not think the bands are a bad product but I do know I cannot wear a ring while I am still working.  Maybe in the future I will be able to wear a wedding band but for now I will not be able to have one even if it is made of silicone."
3.0,"I like the color, style and fit of this top, but, as you might expect for the price, the fabric feels cheap. It has that unnatural, polyestery feel."
3.0,"Too small and slippery to stay on the head, have to tie it super tight just to keep it in place."
3.0,Are really odd
3.0,"I use this one, I'm not sure that polarization is operating or not.<br /><br />During the night driving, I used this one, but I'm not sure effect.<br />I confirmed that right color is changed to yellow from white....but still bright.<br /><br />I'm waiting for using this one at night during the rain.<br /><br />Thanks."
3.0,Too small. I ordered the 3x. Not American sizes. Gave to a friend who loved it. She is going to wear it as a coverup on the beach. Very thin & see thru. Surprised me. I was going to wear it to a dressy banquet.  Glad I had a backup!
3.0,Earings are good but it's too little to wear so I returned it back but the amazon is refusing to return my payment stating that you have sent a wrong item but I sent it correctly
3.0,"Jacket color was good, fit was good, wish they designed it so that the hat can be rolled up"
3.0,Some what large but I can use it as a beautiful swimsuit cover
3.0,From what I read I thought they were 8m (months) but were 8c (child) my 6 month old baby won't fit them until she's about 2 which is ok I guess. Better than being too small.
3.0,"The stone is fake and really cheap, im waiting an oportunity to change the stone to use it. Bad inversion."
3.0,Weird pockets
3.0,"Great quality shirt. Unfortunately I am a breast size C 38. The shamrocks were below my breast and pulling the shirt back looked stupid to me. Other than that , great product. I suggest buying this is you have HUGE breast that way it'll look as it does on you like in the picture."
3.0,Not as easy to put on as apple band.
3.0,It stretches after washing
3.0,Slips out of the hair easily
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress so much! It is pretty, but the flare part just hit my body in a weird spot and didn’t look right. I am curvy, but I think having any hips or tummy makes the flare look awkward. Really wish this worked for me."
3.0,"Much smaller than I thought but really cute, you will not be able to put any cell phone as really is not room for hardly anything, just keys and lipstick, if it was big enough for an small cell phone I will give it a 5."
3.0,"I really do love these, they are good quality and very comfortable and look nice. However, I could not zip them up myself. It takes two hands to hold together then you need another hand to zip it closed. I have to zip it before I put it on over my head."
3.0,"Generally cute, but had a kinda weird fit overall. One of the straps was sewed in a manner that makes it permanently twisted. Very lightweight, could be nice in summer. Not really a fan but I didn't remember to return it in time."
3.0,"The front button placket was pulled too far to one side. I had to alter to  wear it. I like the material and color, just wasn't happy with the sideways placket."
3.0,Too small for my big cranium.
3.0,Top of dress and bottom of dress seem to be different materials. strange.
3.0,"Looks nice. Size did not work. There was no exchange, as alternate sizes were not available. Partial refund was offered as the shipping was prohibitive in cost. The sleeves seemed slightly longer than they should have been (proportionally), but it was too large for me. I believe this was an XL. It was too large for me (42-44&#34; chest), too small for cousin who takes a 46&#34;. I'd surmise an XL is 45&#34; chest..."
3.0,"Absolutely love this necklace but it’s not meant to be worn every day. After about two weeks, the silver coating on both chain and pendant tarnished."
3.0,a bit too big (only one size) and it slips off / becomes loose easily.
3.0,hair ties fall off of the bracelet easily
3.0,Size fit great but very short
3.0,Very easy to break. Right when taken out of the package it was broken. The light will not turn off or switch to the flashing mode. Very disappointed.
3.0,The pockets are nice but fold up.
3.0,Fabric seems ok but the fit isn’t for someone tall. I returned them because The sleeves are ridiculously short.
3.0,Super cute shoe!! Too big for me. Need to go size smaller
3.0,"Beautiful but not a Wallet. TINY.<br /><br />This is a beautiful piece of leather goods, but virtually useless as a wallet.  It is a tiny change purse smaller even then must given away with fine handbags.  Because of its attractiveness and handmade leather quality I have given it 3 stars.  But, I don't see a use for this beyond storing a few coins."
3.0,The little white things on the flowers we're already coming out in the pack when I got them but it's a very pretty bracelet
3.0,Good looking shirt runs a little bit small ended up giving it to a friend.
3.0,"My son got these from Santa and we ordered a little big so that he could grow into them.  He was excited to receive the slippers with his favorite sport on them, and he wanted to wear his cool gift.  The problem is that his feet hang over the back... even though we ordered them big."
3.0,"I ordered the red 2 piece with white polka dots, however I received a solid red.  It fits, however I still want the original  RED 2 piece with WHITE POLKA DOTS size XL."
3.0,Waist fit good bust small like the dress
3.0,Fit but it was a little tight.  I gave it to my sister.
3.0,these gloves are good for the price but they have a very bad terrible chemical smell and the smell is not washing off. But they do come with quite a bit of them.
3.0,The durags were pretty good however the wave cap is pretty low quality. I had to fold the bottom up which was no problem at first until the cap started to become loose. The durags were fine i haven’t ran into any problem with those yet.
3.0,falling apart after 1 year
3.0,"Received this item as a gift and it's okay. This bodystocking does NOT look like the stock photo (the same image is used on the box it arrives in), hence the low rating. Instead, it looks like the photos another reviewer posted. Misleading photo aside it's breathable, you have the ability to wear it on or off your shoulders and the material has some stretch. I'd suggest it if you don't mind receiving something a little different than advertised.<br /><br />My measurements (in inches): 40-31-42.<br />A PIC OF ME WEARING THE ITEM CAN BE FOUND ON MY BLOG (for a link, see my profile description)."
3.0,"It is pretty small, after all it is for a child.  As an adult it will stretch enough for me."
3.0,My daughter thought this would be darker like the picture but it is more drab
3.0,Clings to every curve...
3.0,"Overall I do like this set, just the ones that look black but not sparkly came purple which I do like I just wasn't expecting it, I ordered a pair by itself that was purple so now I have two. The pair that appears to be clear came white. I ordered a pair in the past when I had a smaller gauge and it was as clear as it looked from the given photos."
3.0,"Purchased the black in both LP and XLP about a year ago. Really liked them, especially under blazers. Both fit, but the XLP was a bit more comfortable, so this year I ordered 3 more in red, aqua and white. They are all three MUCH larger than the black XLP. Label says these are  petite, but I have my doubts.  See photo. I am hoping they will shrink when  laundered. The fabric is thin. I would never wear the white shirt in public without a cami underneath."
3.0,Looks more like mother of pearl
3.0,For the money this is an ok product but not satisfied as all those sparkling things were falling off after you take it on hand and some places its completely off showing the inside cloth. The top elastic is too loose and need to fix it properly to wear and be careful about the length as its only for tall women. Need to bring it to a tailoring shop for all these fixes.
3.0,Good fit overall but very short
3.0,I'm returning the 2 pair I purchased.<br />They're not what I was looking for in compression - super stretchy.<br />Odd fit - the front is high rise and the back is much lower. They fit like maternity leggings and it feels like your butt crack is going to make a surprise appearance when you bend down or squat.<br />The pocket is pretty shallow.<br />The packaging is nice.<br />They are soft.
3.0,Misleading. The polka dots are much larger than pictured. Still one of my fave dresses though.
3.0,La tela no es como la esperaba. Muy simple y sencillo.
3.0,"I like this necklace, although I wish it were a little longer. I'm top heavy and the length hits a little strange. Overall, it's a good quality for the price. Would definitely purchase from this shop again!"
3.0,The only thing I saw wrong was it was too long...
3.0,"Cheap quality, disappointing. Should have seen in store 1st and I would not have bought them. But my kid likes them....not worth $18"
3.0,Very baggy and unflattering so order soze down. Not bad quality and not see through so if you purchase keep sizing in mind
3.0,So the top works but the bottoms are a tad big . The material is definitely on the thinner side: somewhat flimsy but super cute! Perfect for baby/toddler girls. Can’t wait for my daughter to be able to wear both pieces.
3.0,5’10” / 150lbs / 36c / ordered a large<br /><br />Beautifulllll soft fabric! But run really really big. It’s super soft but has no support at all and was huge on me. The color is more orange than it appears in the listing. Ordering in a smaller size and hopefully that will work better.
3.0,"I returned the watch immediately after opening the package and seeing that it is large enough to fit a man, both in band size and face diameter. My wrist is small, so it probably could not have been made to fit in any way. I'm sure I would like the watch if it were sized for a woman. Another issue is that the watch was listed in the category of expansion bands (which it is not)."
3.0,I think the dress is very pretty and photographs well however the size small which is their smallest size is more like a medium so for someone my size it was drowning me
3.0,"I love this tunic but the top was so tight I could not pull it off (literally, I'm a 38DD).  If you are generous up top you may find this to be tight.  Order up a size.  Unfortunately ordering up for me did not work out."
3.0,nice but length is not like shown in picture ..its smaller!!
3.0,The description said it was for adults and children but unless your child has a head the size of an adult this is too big. Wish it came in a smaller size 😞
3.0,I really can't say much they are a Christmas gift for my son but I can say they seem to be well built.
3.0,"Fits fine.  I put a candle in front of my face at 6"" and if I blow hard the flame would move a very small amount, the mask is quite effective.  However there is no nose pinch and I rectify this by glueing a ""twistem"" from the grocery store across the bridge of the mask.  This works GREAT in a couple of my masks and I'm a happy camper.  I would buy another .... wish they came with a nose pinch, but it's an easy fix.  Enjoy<br /><br />12/18 have had the mask a few days now. Love the saying, but frankly a cold breeze goes through it and I can move a candle flame a foot in front of my face, the synthetic liner inside is I don't think is helping and I'm now looking for a 3 layer cotton.  I have one three layer cotton and it seems to be working better for me.  Dropped stars from 4 to 3.  good luck"
3.0,I assumed by the picture that this was hard plastic with the moving jaw. It is not its soft and flimsy.
3.0,"I bought two pairs of these, one came perfectly and the other pair ripped after the first wash and the seems were seen terribly. 3 stars bc the good pair are perfect the bad pair deserve a zero"
3.0,"Looks like good quality, but too small. I even have small hands."
3.0,"It runs pretty small. Otherwise, it's pretty.  I had to give it to my young adult daughter who commented that it seemed small as well."
3.0,"cute but as typical with this type of earring, they need to bent to fit the shape of your earlobe. The backs seem to have disappeared, don't know that I received them."
3.0,"I bought both the red and the blue. The red is not the red pictured, its actually darker. More like a burgundy or maroon. I was disappointed, had I known I would not have bought it. Both jackets fit bulky, I thought they would be slimmer based on the information provided. They aren't as thick as a winter jacket, but they aren't as thin as they look. I did give them 3 stars because they are a good quality and at a good price."
3.0,Very stiff looking if your little one won't be walking around in them
3.0,"This dress fit nicely, but the fabric was see-through. I ordered it in white, and you could see my underwear & bellybutton through the fabric. Maybe if you ordered a darker color it would be fine."
3.0,"They do not stay tied together no matter what you do. I will have to use either super glue or clear coat nail polish if I don't want them to untie. Not the best, but still good."
3.0,It pops off during strenuous exercise.
3.0,"I've worn these a few times and still have mixed emotions about them.<br /><br />First, I've got to say, the packaging was subpar.  For a product that ships from China, you'd think a cardboard box would be the minimum protection for shipping; this came in a plastic bag and were as bent as one would expect.  It took several adjustments to get them to fit properly.<br /><br />Second, having worn them a few times they do offer some glare protection, but the yellow tinting isn't uniform when looking at things within a 3' range, like one's dashboard.<br /><br />For the price, I guess they're sufficient, but next time I may just splurge and go to a professional eyewear shop."
3.0,"The shirt is bought was a nice vibrant yellow, however, you need someone to help you tie the sleeves and it tends to untie by itself. Moreover, the off the shoulder part fits closer to the neck. I kept having to pull the shirt down."
3.0,"I liked the band, but as many will notice the buckle is the weakest part of the band.<br />I replaced the buckle from old Garmin bands of my Fenix 3HR"
3.0,"The coat fits as expected,  however I was disappointed with the color as I was expecting a deeper purple and received a lavender colored coat."
3.0,I like it. It's not bad.
3.0,"I really liked this dress, I wore it for travel on our honeymoon. However, I think it gave me a reaction. I was wearing it and suddenly felt almost painfully itchy. My whole chest was splotchy and red. It was not a lasting reaction, but did not end until I took of the dress and showered. I can't return it since I wore it, but I am hesitant to recommend to others."
3.0,"Looks nice, material looks as illustrated, arrived in time as promised, too large. I got to return."
3.0,Too many small ones
3.0,Well made and very cute-- the reason  I'm only giving 3 stars is I usually wear a small and after reading the reviews I ordered a medium and still snugget than I care for- my suggestion is to order 2 sizes up from your usual size
3.0,"I like the shape and color options in this dress. However, I'm 5'6, 135lbs and ordered a medium. If I bend over, you can see up the dress. I'm a teacher and looking for dresses to wear to school. This won't work. Might be good just to wear around the house or to run errands though."
3.0,Super cute but they feel a little cheaply made. Definitely have to be delicate and careful w them.
3.0,"Love these bras, they are like little camisoles. The lace showing is a nice touch. However, the pads inside get all twisted and puckered after they are washed. Some of the lace came loose too. There is some gapping under the arms too. Overall, they get the job done, just would like to have had sturdier construction."
3.0,"Beautiful footless tights, but are very small.  I had to order the 6-8 for my 4 year old daughter."
3.0,So cute but makes me look too large. I am a small woman at 5’4 130lbs and the leg width is very large. Maybe I’m just too short to pull this off
3.0,It looks so much different than picture. It looks like cheap t shirt  On pic looks like nice material
3.0,"When rating the features of this product for comfort, light weight, and stretch I gave 5 stars.  The problem with this product, at least for us, is it didn't stay on the nose of my 4 and 2 year old for more than a minute.  I got these for easier mask wearing for the kids, however they have been more challenging.  I will most likely attach something to hook over the ears, or cut slits.  Even after reading reviews knowing others had issues with it staying up I still purchased in hopes we'd have a different experience."
3.0,"This feels good to wear, the material is comfortable, and the sizing is right. I thought I'd try a new style, but I don't think it works for me. Of course, that's not the maker's fault, that's mine. If you like the style, the price is right!"
3.0,Love the colors but they won't stay on my head 😁
3.0,I mostly wanted it for a chocker because my daughter loves them but it’s not long enough for a choker.But the letters are a good size
3.0,"Gold plated earrings, cute.<br />White/black part of earrings see-through."
3.0,Started losing color after a couple of months. ...
3.0,Its ok for daily use.. but they look very cheap! well they are cheap...
3.0,"I am 5'9&#34;, 170 lb and size 12 fits as expected, however the length fits like a capri for me. Pants looks like fun (I felt like Aladdin in them), very light, with lots of movement, good for hot vacation time, but I decided to return them since it would be hard for me to pair them with any tops. I don't tuck my tops in, and those pants look better with the tops tucked in. Otherwise it creates a shapeless silhouette - too much on the top and too much and wide on the bottom. Another reason for return, it opens and shows the legs too high when I sit down. I felt like it's not age appropriate for me to show my aging skin. Like my husband commented, they will fit better someone with the thick bottom."
3.0,It's an $11 pair of shower shoes.  I haven't got a fungus in the shower yet. They work fine.
3.0,So not what I thought it would be
3.0,This color is see thru.
3.0,can be better
3.0,"Thicker than what I expected, but a cute shirt"
3.0,"I personally love this type of hat and think it's adorable.  BUT - lol if you are a gal without bangs...  I think it looks a bit odd.  It looked awful on me and I sadly had to give it away.  On the flip side, the gal I gave it to (who has bangs) looked great in it and she loves it.<br />PS - it also had an odd chemical smell to it - I suggest washing it before wearing"
3.0,Not pleased ..not like shown .. disappointed
3.0,The socks are comfortable. I bought them because the price was great. They are a little higher than I like. I’m sure that will come in handy in the winter.
3.0,Under bra straps did not stay put
3.0,"It's definitely sheer, need to wear a nude strapless bra because even nipple covers will show through.  Fits well, not the best quality fabric, but smokin' hot dress for a night on the town."
3.0,Suppose to be true to size.  It's not.I normally were a large in mens but couldn't even button a large.  Very disappointed with the sizing of the shirt. But love the the actual shirt. I ordered an xxlarge. Really hope this fits cause I really love this shirt.
3.0,Tight in the tummy. I was so excited to get his dress for a trip I was going on. It made me look like a cow.
3.0,Looks like they will be a great present for my family.
3.0,"Ehh.I will say the hat itself is nice. It’s not a cheap looking hat. However the narwhal decal is disappointing. Faded, not vibrant. I would go with another hat but since this is for my 10 year old, I’m not going to waste my time sending it back."
3.0,Ok for cheap earrings.  Tassels not always same length.
3.0,The sun glasses were too large and won't stay on my face..Fast delivery and the looked nice
3.0,Dislike the not real zipper pocket. And the front zipper zip up on the left side.<br />Like I can still use it.
3.0,I have been buying Bombas socks since they started and they were always my favorites. I still like the way they fit and feel...but I USED to like that they were also long lasting.  Now they get holes in the heel within a year.  Why did they change the way they made them???
3.0,"The colour is a fair shade more orange than it appears in the picture (I bought the Rust colour). So I'm a bit unhappy about that.<br /><br />A few loose strings hanging off under the collar, pocket, and sleeves, one big string hanging loose across one side of the right sleeve. Plus they've got these pins stuck in that leave little holes crowned by a sort of &#34;plume&#34;/fuzzball of frayed material once they've been taken out. Also I have a little rip/possibly a hole in the left armpit. Looks like the material slipped out of the way of the sewing machine and got torn, and never closed up that spot.<br /><br />The collar seems decent, nice and sharp looking, seems pretty thick and sturdy. Also seems to fit quite well, as well as I'd expect for a shirt of this price. In fact everything about the materials and &#34;assembly&#34; seems in order, except those loose strings.<br /><br />I'll get out the scissors and trim those strings, I'm sure it'll be a decent shirt once I take the iron to it. I'll gripe silently about the colour but it's not the end of the world. Just beware if you're looking for a very specific shade."
3.0,"I like these pants overall (fun print, soft fabric, nice waistband), but the ankle cuffs are about twice the size they need to be. I can tighten them with a pin and it's fine, but then again I'm short enough that the baggy pant legs cover the cuffs, so the pin won't show."
3.0,"Quality and construction are good for the price. Definitely a little small in the bust. The color was not at all as pictured. The purple in the picture is a rich royal purple, instead, I got pastel purple."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter. It is very cute and the fit is flattering.  However, it does fade after being in the pool."
3.0,The crown is smaller than it looks in the photo. I wish it was a little more generous so it slouches in the back like the photo.
3.0,"The shorts didn't seem to have a full underwear. Luckily they are dark and you can't see through them. In my case, the shirt seemed the right size, but the shorts seemed a little too big/long."
3.0,Color bad. Cream white didn’t go with a thing it was such an odd coloration. Should have returned it.
3.0,"Short torso, don't buy if you're over a D-cup."
3.0,"Color is good however, the material is cheap and does not hold its shape"
3.0,For reference I am a dress size 16/18 with a 42D bust.<br /><br />I can wear a size XL to an XXL.<br /><br />This sweater is made while it’s not bad. It’s not short or anything like that but it does not hang as loose as it shows in the photo. If you want it to hang loose like it shows in the photo I suggest ordering up one or two sizes. The XXL it’s not going to be suited for anyone probably ever a size 18 it just looks like a regular sweater if you’re a size 14 it might hang loose on you. I’m just disappointed with the way that it does not look like the photos at all.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it does feel like a nice material and it’s a decent sweater but that’s about it.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,Decent<br />A bit wide for me
3.0,Wrist and neck openings were really tight but the rest of the sweatshirt fit well
3.0,"I got the largest size that I could get which was the XL, if you are a size 16 or higher this might not fit you as expected. I  am sure once I loose some weight this shirt will fit me much better."
3.0,"This hoodie is just as described and my daughter loves it. The lower rating is because the seller failed to disclose it was being shipped from China and took several weeks to get here, not the five days promised when I ordered it."
3.0,"Looks very good, made well. It was not long enough. Had to return it. It was size 2X."
3.0,"Problem is that these things are so short.  I'd like 'em better if they at least covered my ankles.  Other than that, they're comfortable and fit fine.  But what's up with the short fit?  I don't get it."
3.0,The garnet stones were completley different colors.  They could have tried to match them more closely
3.0,"This is a child's watch or perhaps suitable for a petite woman. Even so, the display is tiny. If that is what you want, the watch functions well. If you want and easy to read display in a watch that has a band adequate for a man's wrist, try another Casio"
3.0,It’s cute I love it for my niece but it’s running small. You need to get 1 size bigger
3.0,"UPDATE: This wallet is still holding up to all my cards and has actually been easier to button and somehow the material settled enough that it doesn't take up as much space in my purse! Love it!<br /><br />It does hold the amount of cards that it says, but when you put all your cards in, it's hard to button. I'm hoping that it will<br />stretch a bit with time and not fall apart."
3.0,"Came quickly, and works as described, but I am a little concerned about the teeth, scratching my bracelet."
3.0,Material is very thin. Love the sleeve design.
3.0,"Very wrinkled and much shorter than expected.  Fabric is ok, hope it washes well.  Not as nice as another clothing line at same price."
3.0,Too large around my neck
3.0,"I love this top, but it runs small.  It’s very pretty but not true to size."
3.0,I usually wear XS or small. These pants run very large. The color is a greenish gray. Did not work for me.
3.0,Softest leggings I’ve ever had! I am 8 months pregnant and everything is uncomfortable I. Am 5’10 & 170lbs I got the L/XL For length I probably should have went with the S/M...
3.0,Would have liked it a whole lot more if it fit and didn't have to give it to a friend instead not large chested friendly
3.0,"These are very cute and are exactly as pictured except for one thing. The bottom clip is not as round as in the picture. It is pointy and a little sharp. Another reviewer stated this, but I thought the picture might have been an updated hair clip. I will definitely use these, but beware that they aren't round."
3.0,My daughter liked it. The size was just right and she's a small.
3.0,"So I got this garbage bag... errr... poncho to try out. I'm a fairly large guy who doesn't fit well into the typical cheaper ponchos. We have a bunch of them that we take on our trips to WDW because the weather is so fickle in Florida. You never know when drenching rain will occur. When I saw this poncho, I thought it might be a good fit for my frame; I was wrong.<br /><br />The poncho was nicely folded into the reversible pocket. The material is high quality. At first the poncho appeared large enough... until I put it on. First off, the buttons which hold the sides together kept coming apart every time I moved around. If you had a backpack, you would naturally need to unbutton them to fit it over the pack. However, I was intending to use the poncho while not wearing a backpack, so the constant struggle to keep the sides closed wasn't ideal. The second issue is the hand straps. While they should keep the wind from pulling the poncho away from your arms, the material barely came past my elbow. My forearms were mostly exposed to the outside and thus would get very wet. Lastly, the hood was a struggle to get on. At first I thought it was an elastic type opening but quickly realized it wasn't when trying to fit it over my noggin. I quickly found the Velcro release to make the hole wider but still couldn't fit it on... my wife noticed there was also a zipper near the Velcro which allowed the head to open up further. Now that I know how it works, it doesn't seem all that complicated, but had I waited until I was in the middle of a thunderstorm, I would have been soaked before I figured it all out. Minor annoyance though... but still didn't make a good first impression.<br /><br />Overall this isn't a bad poncho. The material alone is much better than anything you will find cheaper in a local store (or the high priced ones you will find in a Disney store while seeking shelter from the rain). However it really does look like you are wearing a large garbage bag... which is not the image I want to portray to other people while I walk through a Disney park with my family. If you are a hiker, this might be a good poncho for you."
3.0,I was looking for something to help me not lose my keys so this looked perfect cause it was a bracelet little did I know these beads are hugeeee and the wrist size for these were for two and a half extra wrists(I do have a small wrist) I really thought it be tight and stretchy but no. I wanted to return it but for 6 dollars I just ripped it apart and made a new one.
3.0,My son loves them because they are black panther but they are cheap foam and won't last past this summer.
3.0,Did not fit on my head as expected but will keep as I will have grown my hair out by winter and it may fit better at that time.
3.0,"The quality is good, but I ordered a large and it was not as large as I expected. Fortunately my wife was able to use it."
3.0,"Not boy short at all in the legs. Would be perfect if was. Awkward fit. I'm 115 pounds and 5'7&#34;, a small was correct in length but it was very tight and cut into my butt."
3.0,I bought this fleece shawl to keep me warm after hand surgery. It is smaller and not as thick as one that I bought from a different manufacturer. Perhaps it will work better when the weather is warmer.
3.0,"Not what I thought I was getting. I thought the hats were a Little sturdier than what they were. They’re very flimsy and easy to break when using with children, not built to last long."
3.0,It didn't fit well at all.  I gave it to goodwill.
3.0,"Didn’t even come with four head jewels, only two and then the two bracelets. They are very beautiful and not as flimsy as I thought they would be."
3.0,i loved this...so beautiful but in the ocean tgw finish wore off quickly and it became silver which was super dissappointing.
3.0,one bracelet was broken.  The other one is perfect.
3.0,soft and looks just like the photo however is a bit flimsy. i pulled the strap in order to tighten the knots and the stitches broke. no biggy since its just the strap and cant complain w this price point. need somw major heels to wear this
3.0,"Nice bag but disappointed that the leather is rough. Depending on what you are wearing, its a lil snaggy. The corners of the leather looked a bit roughed up like it may have been used. But it is a perfect size bag. I did contact the seller and was told the leather is meant to be rough. I didnt see that important feature in the description."
3.0,I got a medium I'm 5'4 120lb and I just got it on. Won't if I wash it. It was very soft inside and nice smooth material outside. I wish I could exchange for the same price I got on sale.
3.0,"Compared to my under armour cold gear, the tesla shirts seem a little small."
3.0,The dress is a nice in style but I think they are smaller than the size advertised. I returned my order. Order a size up (or two) if you order. Good thing is it isn't see through.
3.0,I don’t believe this is a authentic Mojang Product. Mojang (the creators of Minecraft) package their shirts in high end protective plastic ziplock like packages. My shirt came without the official Mojang merchandise tag which is always included. The print on the inside back neck is also questionable.  Authentic Mojang products are of much higher quality. Just being honest as I compare authentic merchandise.
3.0,"The ring is really pretty, but unfortunately, the finger I planned to wear it on is normally a size 5, and this was too loose, with no way of really tightening it (that I could figure out -- you could press it closer together, but it wouldn't stay closed).  If your ring finger is a size 5 or smaller, then I would avoid purchasing this.  Bigger fingers should be fine."
3.0,"Bought these for new suitcases for my kids. By the time we got home, most had been lost through the process of checking luggage for our flight. Disappointed."
3.0,"Beautiful band but to short on length, and I have small wrist."
3.0,This bathing suit is really cute but I ordered a medium and the top felt like an extra extra small and I am not top heavy and the bottom was almost a little big. I don't know how anyone could make this work unless you can order different sizes for top and bottom. Quick delivery though.
3.0,"I had high hopes for these leggings, but they just didn't cut it for me. I ended up returning them. They are not as stretchy as my other leggings (Fabletics for example). They seemed really stiff. The opening at the ankle was too big, so I thought it looked funny. I am 5'8"", 180 lbs. and I ordered a large. It was fine size wise, but the way the waist band fits was not flattering to my tummy. They also do not stay up during HIIT or running. They are thick, but I didn't check to see if they were squat-proof."
3.0,Large for me but I will keep them. I'm 5 ft 145 lbs I have muscular legs. Waist 28 in. Hips 42
3.0,"Fits well, the tie in the back does a good job of tightening the hat to prevent it from blowing away in the wind. Expected higher quality for the price. I will keep it, but it should be priced no higher than $15."
3.0,"The stretchy fabric fits snugly. I didn’t expect it to run small, and I definitely wish I would have sized up. The image is as pictured but it is kind of pixelated in person. I still like the image but now I feel like I need to lose a few pounds before I’ll be comfortable wearing this shirt. Bummer."
3.0,"The material is nice and the quality seems good, but it is huge.  It is way bigger than it looks in the picture and there is no way to put a belt around it to gather it in.  I am 5' 1&#34; and small boned and it swims on me.  I would not recommend ordering it, or any of the tops this seller has like it, unless you are at least 5' 5&#34; and an 8 or 10 in size."
3.0,They do not breathe at all! Terrible for working out! Get cotton!
3.0,"Out fit see through,cheap looking and feel,has plenty stretch,wouldn't waste my money on it thou, im going to regift it for Christmas. I ordered xxl. Has no structure or tag to resemble front to back.took about a 2 weeks to recieve."
3.0,not of the best quality.
3.0,"For a much smaller woman, this could be a fabulous idea. No shoulder straps or back strap digging into you! For me, gravity won the fight, hands down, every time, and I gave these things several different tries before I gave up. The “rabbit ears” kept slipping, little by little, ultimately leading to farcical moments. Also, the shape was clearly discernible through my blouse. I caught several people staring at my chest as if they were trying to figure out what weird thing was going on there. (The pads do not fully cover you, so the outline is odd.) Removal was absolutely excruciating. Tears sprang to my eyes. But again, someone much more petite than me might be able to make these things work. If you are a slender small woman, the dream of freedom is worth a try. The idea is so wonderful, I truly hope they work for someone else!"
3.0,Not made for taller girls. It fits but I would never wear it in public.
3.0,The picture does not show the &#34;real&#34; color. It is much more colorful and too irisdecent. It should be mentioned in the description. It only says &#34;silver&#34;.
3.0,"Way smaller than a Large.  Luckily, I ordered for my daughter-in-law, but I can wear it.  So I will keep"
3.0,Reduce the glare but little weak.
3.0,"It is too long, I had to cut about 4in from the length of these shirts to make them fit my perfectly normal 6yo. Because they are underwear it wasnt a big deal but it would have been good to know"
3.0,It was a gift to my granddaughter. I never saw it. My daughter in law said it was cute.
3.0,Fits great but have only washed it three times and the design is already wrinkled like it will start coming off.
3.0,I liked these. I bought them for protection from COVID as my work is in ICU. They are comfortable. They did not fog up. I wore a pair for one 12.5 hr shift. I bought two other types of goggles. I chose to go with the Solid work brand goggles. See my review. These are great for the value and just as safe and comfortable. I liked the other pair because there is no split line between both eyes. I have vision problems so any obstruction to my eyesight is a problem. That was the deciding factor for me between the two pairs. I haven’t tried the third pair of goggles that I ordered yet. So I will try to update my review after I do.
3.0,"Our toddler loves these! One of the shoes has already lost its brightness, though and the light up is a bit duller than the other shoe. She isn't happy about that, but because it still lights up, she's not complaining much. Would have liked for that to last a bit longer, she's only worn them for a little over a week! Maybe it's just the nature of shoes that light up?"
3.0,I cant really speak much for these because I purchased these to where with a costume and never got to use them however I can saw that they are not as full and fluffy as the pictures shows.
3.0,"I was disappointed in the fit of these gloves.  First, they do not come in different sizes as many gloves do so I assumed that they would be somewhat of a midsize or average size glove.  Unfortunately, these are so tight that they will no longer work as a Christmas gift for my daughter as I intended. She has slim fingers but she's 5' 8&#34; and her fingers are longer than mine.  On me, my fingers came right to the end of the finger tips so I know the finger part of the glove will be too short.  The glove itself overall is quite tight on me and they are uncomfortable to wear. If the size were correct, these would actually be very nice gloves.  They have a very nice feel on the inside and I particularly like the cuff.  The gloves are reasonably soft and flexible.  If you have small hands and fingers, these would be very nice gloves for you."
3.0,"I do know that under the rim near the back where I grab it, there is a metal barb that I caught my finger on.  I know where it is now, but anyone else may not.  I have the liners but haven't used them yet wither.  It's not easy putting a 170 lb man on any bedpan and have him like it!"
3.0,The toe box is too long. The thong strap is too tight and it feels as though the toe piece needs to be moved forward.
3.0,"Little thin, not so warm"
3.0,Run small - cheap material too expensive
3.0,"These wine glass tags are a super cute idea. I'm part of a wine club so I purchased the set for Christmas gifts for the other girls. I thought that I would be able to put everyones picture on one side and initals on the other. I think that it would have worked in theory but the software that is provided to scale and size your picture is impossible to figure out. It didn't work on my home computer and was incredibly picky on my work computer, I never did manage to get it to scale a single photo and had to settle for hand cutting out my initials. I would not reccomend this product unless you had another way of scaling the photos."
3.0,Nice blouse. Not crazy about the fringe around neck.Very worth the money
3.0,Overall much better quality than the traditional stirrup style stays you can buy most places. However the clamps aren't tight enough to grab onto a dress shirt or BDU shirt. Have had to bunch up the material to get the clamps to stay on.
3.0,Cheaply made. I used the shirt for a production and had to replace the pants with something more substantial.
3.0,The straps are not as wide as they look in the picture. That's kinda what I was going for when I bought the belt. They are just the normal width though
3.0,Material is not bad. Your nose has to be as flat and wide as Texas to fit your nose's ridge.
3.0,Needs more material on forehead for perspiration.
3.0,"The only issue is, the band doesn’t stay in place. So you’re constantly having to fix it over and over."
3.0,Super soft but material wants to pill.
3.0,"I did not like it, too stiff and the strap was uncomfortable, but I gave it to my daughter and she likes it a lot and got tons of compliments. Very pretty blue though"
3.0,Both of the earrings were broken when I received them.  But the price was so good and they really are pretty.  Thank goodness for super glue! Hopefully they will stay together so I can wear them.
3.0,I can't wait to wear them
3.0,"Lavender is more grayish lavendar and as others have said, it smells.  Otherwise the band is good."
3.0,really cute top! made small way to tight! wish they had It in bigger size. I usually wear a large ordered large and its way too small fit like a medium or small!!!
3.0,I didn't see the leopard patches on the pants or I wouldn't have ordered.  They fit ok. I decided to keep them since I can hide the leopard under a long top.  These were made in China if that makes a difference to anyone.
3.0,Metal color fades to copper/brass
3.0,"The color and style of this top is very attractive. The blouse was sent and received quickly and very well packaged.<br />My only problem is the buttons are around 2"" apart and there is a 4"" gap between the bottom button and the tie. This might not seem to be a problem for some but to me it was a lot of skin showing unless a camisole is worn underneath. I did not notice this in the picture before ordering it and had already disposed of the packaging so will end up keeping the top anyway."
3.0,"Really like this piece, fits good, the clasps are kind of awkward though. They turn sideways, and the cloth attached to the wings on one side was kind of loose (is starting to come out of the tube) so I haven't worn it in a while. But other than that I loved the design, look, and feel of the bracelet."
3.0,No to small
3.0,"Reordered this twice to try and get size right; even their XXL was too small. Otherwise, a sturdy, stylish suit that could have been just what I needed.<br />Third star is due to the Company being very helpful about exchanging and accepting returns within their stated time period (I think 30 days)."
3.0,jeans were great. i bought a size too small.
3.0,"The material was not at all what I was expecting, it's like thin windbreaker material."
3.0,The logos are hard to see through the fuzziness of the hat
3.0,"Large enough, but the fabric is extremely clingy, and unflattering."
3.0,They look better in a picture and a little scratchy.<br />Locking mechanism is good and sturdy.<br />Somewhat stylish.
3.0,The sizes aren't consistant with the manufacturers overseas so it is hard to determine the correct size to shoot for when ordering but the quality was good. It did take quite a while to get it in the mail and there wasn't a tracking number so it was a guessing game. Although by US standards I'd be considered a small or medium apparently that is not the case in China where I must be the size of a family since I ordered a LARGE and the bottoms would fit a child..  I still give them 3 stars for the quality and the fact that I did in fact eventually receive the suit.
3.0,"I loved these glasses when I got them, but within a week, the lens was scratched, and the color came off. Must scratch easy, because they were in the case alot and taken care of. It's too bad, they were a cute pair of glasses."
3.0,"Am surprised to read that the product runs large. It was too tight for me and it was thicker than I expected.<br />Buyers, be aware that if you decide to return it, you'll have to pay for the return postage."
3.0,"This is the cutest duster.. I love the color combination.  I wear a size 10-12 and ordered a size Large, but it was too small. Also, the pockets were not stitched properly, a portion of it was not tucked in, so it looked lopsided instead of a perfectly sewn pocket. I am bummed that I had to send it back."
3.0,"I will start by saying the fit on the is perfect. They are comfortable, the straps stay put and do not dig into my shoulders, and they are very supportive. I've been very careful with them as far as washing goes. I had each and hang to dry. Everything about these bras is great.<br />My one issue is that I bought these in September and it's now November and one of them already has an underwire that is poking through on the right side. I expect more than 2 months wear especially when I follow washing instructions and am very careful with them. I was disappointed to find no way to contact the company. I really do love the bras and am waiting to see how the second one holds up. So far it seems fine,  but now I'm left a bra short and no way to return it or get a replacement."
3.0,"Love this suit still trying to convince myself to keep it.. absolutely need to take the weird circle cups out, but I am 5'4 and have a shorter torso and it's a bit long"
3.0,It's pretty but also pretty fragile.
3.0,"I'm generally fairly careful about my sizing when I buy from Amazon.  I buy a lot of Asian sizing and am very familiar with how I need to size up.  I sized up 2 sizes for this dress, and while it fits, it doesn't fit well.  I am losing weight so I kept the dress, but if you are even slightly curvy, size up 3 instead of 2."
3.0,It's pretty but not durable its just plastic with a reflecting rainbow coating
3.0,"I like the look of this Sidefeel Halter Fringed Floral Printed Padded Set Tassel Bikini Swimwear however the sizing runs a little small.  This will be fine for my backyard pool but not something I would wear out to the beach.  As I said, I like it and will be wearing it but it's not exactly what I had hoped it would have been.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for an honest review. I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.  If my review helped you in any way can you please click the yes button that it helped?  I honestly try to help others with my honest reviews of products, because that is what I rely upon for my purchases too!"
3.0,I like the product it's just a bit tight.
3.0,"They dont match the rose gold of the galaxy active 2 very well, but I was aware going in that rose gold is hard to match anyway. They feel nice and install great. Would be better with a black or silver face watch."
3.0,Ok just super thin
3.0,For me it just doesn't work for tummy control but it don't ride up so that is a plus it is comfortable you can ware it all day
3.0,"I bought these heel protectors to use with shoes I was wearing as a bridesmaid in a friend's wedding on the grass. They did serve the purpose of preventing my shoes from sinking into the grass, so in that sense, it's a good product. HOWEVER, they are really a one-time use product. By the end of the 8-hour period I was wearing the heel protectors, the heels had busted through the bottom of the protectors, breaking them, so I'll never be able to use them again. I had let a friend borrow the second pair of protectors that came in the package, and hers broke within an even shorter period (3 - 4 hours). The price is a bit expensive for a one-time use product."
3.0,I like the embroidery but the cap is a little small
3.0,"The bathing suit looked just as it had appeared online, my only complaint involved the material the straps and see through mid section was made of. It felt very scratchy and rough and reminded me of the ribbon you'd use when your wrapping a fancy Christmas gift."
3.0,"I like it, but it smelled strange when I opened the package. I've worn it a few times now and it still smells. The top of the necklace doesn't hold well to the shape, but I like it still because it's such a statement piece."
3.0,"I bought these pajamas specifically because it said that they were 100% cotton. The tag says that they are 60% cotton/40% acrylic.<br /><br />They are kind of cute and nicely made, but that acrylic would be scratchy and not breathable."
3.0,I like it but the size 12 is a little small for me. I'm planning to return it and got a bigger size but the problem is that if I get bigger than 12 which is my regular size it might too big for me.
3.0,Fits very loose and large. Soft.
3.0,Nice material and color. Was a few inches longer than I thought
3.0,"They are bigger than I expected, but like them."
3.0,the plugs are a little long and dont sit quite right in your ears.
3.0,Color was a bluish white. Size runs large
3.0,Like the band but it was missing the curved ends.  Would love to have them sent to me if possible.<br />Will update review if they do.
3.0,"I was disappointed because the photo shows a pink band going around hoodie with the word, (shrimp) on it, but the one I received has a red band with the word shrimp on it. I only got it because it showed like a hot PINK."
3.0,"These are wide and true to size. They have a substantial sole with good tread on the bottom that you will not find in other huaraches.<br /><br />They are the only pair of shoes I own that keep my heel in without blisters. No uncomfortable rubbing or chaffing or pinching. This is pretty huge. I have wide feet with wider toes. I usually size up for width, but the 8.5 was too big so I exchanged for my size in wide and they are perfect. They are tight over the (high) top of my foot and for my toes, but after wearing them for a few hours, I already felt them stretching out.<br /><br />Cons: The foot bed is hard and totally flat. If possible, you'll want something: either a padded or supportive partial insole. The leather is what you find on all huaraches. It's thin.<br /><br />Good or bad, the arch area is pretty narrow. At first I couldn't fit any arch support or a padded insole, not even a little wedge for the arch. But I wore them around the house with socks and they stretched out enough to put arch support in there. I used ""foot petals"" instead of a real insole, they provide enough padding.<br /><br />Good, but needs some padding."
3.0,The rose glasses are quite different than the picture.  It is very dark and the flowers on the glasses are not real visible.  A little disappointing.
3.0,Greta for holding multiple cards but its just a little too big to use all the time.
3.0,It's ok for our short Florida winters.
3.0,The wristlet was really cute but the coach logo made it look fake and cheap.
3.0,Looks much cleaner online. Blue enamel seemed blurry covering the outlines of the stars
3.0,The size was larger than usual SMALL size.
3.0,"I was really excited by the fit, then it shrank and it’s a weird length"
3.0,"Bag is attractive but the 2 front pockets are sub optimal for storage.  The design of the Baggallini Hanover is great, this one is awkward."
3.0,"Even tho I got a large, it’s just way too short and too small. I’m bummed because this is such a cute dress"
3.0,"EDIT: This company is amazing and so is this bag. They immediately emailed about the zipper problem mentioned below, apologized and replaced the bag completely for free! You can’t go wrong with this bag and I’ve now flown three times with it and I can’t get over how nice it looks and functional it is!<br />This bag is so cute and has so much room inside. I love that it has handles as well as the adjustable strap. My only complaint is that the zipper on the outside pocket was broken the first time I used it and now it won’t zip shut."
3.0,"Item is smaller than it appears in the pictures, and the dual straps didn't fit over my shoulder comfortably (even though the illustration of the bag being held shows it goes over the shoulder with room to spare).  I'm not fond of purses that don't know whether they are a shoulder bag, or an arm bag, so I returned it.  Nothing wrong with the product, just wasn't what I was searching for."
3.0,Not as big as I hoped. Barely makes a bow. I like when I have more material for a big bow.
3.0,"This outfit is actually very well made, I however ended up with a bum zipper.  It arrived broken so I have been unable to wear it."
3.0,"Cute. VERY cute.  Fit is good.  Socks are comfortable, but........each PAIR of socks is unique.  Therefore, lose a sock? The mate is a “one sock only”.  So....order TWO sets? I don’t know........"
3.0,"Not as pretty as the product photo. And they are comically large. If you are going for a country bumpkin Halloween costume, these are perfect!"
3.0,"They’re ok. Before wearing i put them in the wash to see how they will hold out. They handled the washer well, but I did notice a tear where the tag is after a few days. I don’t know if it was there when I got it (if memory serves I did inspect before putting in wash) , if it’s cause these are a tight fit especially the pants (I swear if I eat anything else they won’t fit). Or if it’s from rolling during sleep. But I know that I have only had them for a few days and I noticed that tear. I’m going to assume it’s a factory defect cause nothing else tore and it is a very neat, perfect cut. Otherwise, if buying get a size up especially if your thoughts are on the thicker side."
3.0,Looks cool but not sturdy.
3.0,I am a bit frustrated that the sizing chart only goes up to 24 months. I ordered a 2T-3T size for my daughter who is currently 2 and the dress looks very small. It would be helpful if the sizing chart was accurate and went all the way up to size 6 since this dress goes up to size 6!!
3.0,I guess I just thought the 20 grams would be a little more. It came in a tiny little baggy about the size of my thumbnail.
3.0,Attractive design and two tone color but clearly a design flaw—would not stay buckled and kept falling off. Returned.
3.0,My daughter liked them but I examined them and the white material is really offset and bulky.  It was hanging off the side and we had to sand it down to make it look even.  Not a good selection on my part.
3.0,It’s just too wide
3.0,"Nice and soft material , not oversized or as long as depicted . Regular length sweater at best"
3.0,"Was given as a gift to a Chevelle owner.  Fabric was of good quality and fit was satisfactory, but 1 more larger size would have been better for a larger person. Other vendors offer sizes up to 3x.  Was not satisfied for the printed graphics, seemed to be washed out, not as vivid and sharp as the illustration used  for advertisement"
3.0,It's okay. The sides go out a little and it's very cheaply made.
3.0,Really cute paired with leggings. I wore with cropped legging. Was very cute but it's a little short in length and tight in bust on me. I am a 38DD chest.
3.0,Sadly the band falls off very easily. I ordered the large band as I wear the large that came with the Fitbit Versa. The screen protector is pretty good. It is a little difficult to press the buttons on the side tho. It also allows a good amount of water under it but it is easy to remove to dry it off.<br /><br />Update 10/23/19: I received an email asking if I wanted a replacement sent in case it was just a malfunction. I have yet to receive the replacement.
3.0,Looked rusted
3.0,Product was loose around the calf and hardly stayed up on the leg
3.0,"Back side sharp no safety easy to loose , no twist in"
3.0,It was k
3.0,I went two sizes up as suggested as I am a 38 DD and it is too big around the waist and bust too. I would suggest getting only 1 size larger if you have a larger bust. However it is a cute and comfortable dress as it is made out of a cotton material.
3.0,"The material is thick and shiny, but a little heavy and the dress is not as flowy as I hoped. I didn’t like the style around the neck either. I got the green and it wasn’t dark green in my opinion, more like a kelly green. The color was the main reason I returned."
3.0,The dress was very cute and nice material but very very snug! Unfortunately I had to return.
3.0,"The lightning bolt is too thick to fit in my earring hole in my ear. Cute idea but, disappointed in the quality.  I showed how big it is compared to the other one I bought at the same time."
3.0,The skirt is cute but darker than the picture and doesn't hang the same on. I looked at the reviews and got a larger size than I normally wear but ai can still barely zip it up. I will keep the one I have but I was planning on ordering a second and will instead look for something else.
3.0,"I mean, it's what it looks like. The fit is a bit odd, and honestly I don't know a single person who has ""pretty"" knees so with those two things in mind it's really not all that flattering. However it isn't terrible at all and it came very quickly so I blame myself more than the company."
3.0,"The shirt was larger and more flowy than expected. I got an XL and definitely could've gotten a L. The crisscross front doesn't lie flat (strings too long) like in the picture - I ended up cutting it off because it looked silly. Shirt was really soft though and perfect for a summer luau party. Won't buy another, but it got the job done."
3.0,I ordered a 6.. way too smalll.  Then an 8…even smaller.  Then a 10…way too big.  Went to try and reorder.  Price had doubled and no sizes left to to try.  Darn.
3.0,Clasp a bit scratchy
3.0,"love the style but the are too big for my head, fell off every time I looked down.  I think I have an average size head for a woman."
3.0,"First off, it came a month early which I loved, but a couple days after I got it, the chain on my part (the angel wing) snapped! And today a few hours after my chain snapped, I have my boyfriend his part. First off when he put it on, it was to small. It looked like a chocker necklace on him, and when he was taking it off for a longer chain, the chain the necklace came with snapped. The chains are very weak and crappy. But the wing parts are beautiful and a good size."
3.0,I love these shoes and they're comfortable to wear. The only problem is that one shoe looks as if the leather was stretched incorrectly. The shoe looks rather wrinkly but the other shoe is perfect. It isn't horribly noticeable when wearing it.
3.0,fits ok but for someone who has chuncky arms like myself its tight on the arm
3.0,"I had to return. I like this brand a lot (it is typically well made), but the green color was a little darker than I expected, and the sleeves me feel a little witchy."
3.0,the material isnt very thick
3.0,"These are very skinny. They are too snug on my daughter who normally wears the size I order. They also have a low rise that my daughter wasn’t comfortable with. Unless your kid is a twig, these will probably be too small."
3.0,The chains are very cheap. They all broke very quickly. The leather pieces however are nice and hold up.
3.0,"This is a nice flannel shirt, if a bit thinner than I expected. The main problem is I ordered the medium and got the large. Therefore, I really can’t give this shirt a fair review."
3.0,No cumplió todas las expectativas de la imagen.
3.0,Material is see thru.
3.0,"and if thats the way you roll, go for it, you badass babe. I wanted to wear this to work though so it won't fly. Also, Im a pretty standard medium, size 6 and this fits like a small small.."
3.0,"I disliked the fact that it did not come inflated as I did not expect that and was unaware. Picture of the athlete is also a little digital-y, if that makes sense."
3.0,I really love this bag but after only a couple of months the seams are coming undone.
3.0,I ordered this as a shirt to wear casually but I am not sure how I will as the white is very see through.  It will have to be a workout shirt with sports bra underneath. It’s too bad because the material is soft and the cut of the shirt is flattering.
3.0,"These socks are so cute and warm, but pilled up the first time I wore them. The also felt slightly smaller than other socks."
3.0,Doesn't quite hang like the picture. The longer one is way long.
3.0,The tops fit but a little on the small side.  The material was soft & they were well made. My granddaughter loved them.
3.0,"was allergic to the plastic, couldn't wear to my Halloween party. ;("
3.0,It’s to small for my son. Great material.
3.0,Only works for one side of ear
3.0,seemed like good quality but could not begin to get on my size 13 feet
3.0,Even though I sent all my measurements; this dress was too small. I needed another four inches to zip it up. I would add at least 3 inches to all your measurements to make sure it fits. If you have to return it you will have to mail it back to China. The seller will credit your shipping costs as well as the cost of the dress to your method of payment if you have to return it.
3.0,Cute dress. Fit is ok. the Buttons aren't sewed on very well and fell off within a few washes.
3.0,its fine....
3.0,Disappointed they run small by a size if anyone orders XL get 2xl
3.0,"I bought this for a friend at Christmas. Came in a secure cover, nice fabric, and fit her well. Also shipped fast and arrived before Christmas Day. Would but again from this place."
3.0,Great band but comes loose because of design flaws. A little sideways wiggle and it pops right off. Doesn't quite 'click' in. Had to use a Drexel to create a proper Grove that the fit bit latch can click into. Now it stays on perfectly.
3.0,"Even the XL is too small.  This was one attempt; anticipating size would not be good, I also ordered XXL.  It was too small as well.  Normal size foot.  Barely fit my wife's small foot.  Wish they would make a real large and XL or XXL size.  They were nice.  The wife and daughter likes them."
3.0,"Really like the comfort and they work well.  It is aweful that the color rubs off almost immediately from friction.  It looks bad, very dirty looking.  If that could be fixed these are a 5 for me."
3.0,"Gorgeous color!  But the  fabric pilled quite a bit after first wash. I hanged the dress to dry per instructions, but still a lot of “fabric balls” sitting on the dress."
3.0,I have weird side boob in this top. Bottoms are a bit thin.
3.0,"I loved these earrings. They were stylish and light enough to not feel like your earlobes were being pulled down. However, they do not come with a simple earring back or keeper and I lost one the very first time I wore them. If you order them, DO NOT wear them without a slide on back."
3.0,Petite women like me I’m sorry to say this will NOT fit us. Not even the small. I’m 5”2 and 100 lbs. it’s HUGE on me. It’s so pretty though! Guess I can at least use the robe!
3.0,"These shoes are really cute.  The plastic is very soft and seems comfortable.  There is a little padding in the shoe as well.  I gave the shoes three stars because only one shoe lit up.  The other shoe never lit up, and the button that is on the shoe never worked.  I wish there was some sort if quality control before the shoes were shipped to make sure they were working since other reviews had the same issue."
3.0,"see the photo...it has ""DTANCING"" and bottom has ""CHANPION"" the mask is show straight down the middle...."
3.0,"Super cute, but the material is hard, and the zipper did not work"
3.0,I ordered this for my 4 year old niece and it was basically the size of a 2 year old.
3.0,It was cute but I ordered the wrong size. It was big for me even if I wore it loose.
3.0,Washed before I wore it and the black faded immediately. I washed it on cold and inside out.
3.0,Love the fit. I have had  for a few months and one pair are already falling apart so will not buy again. Maybe washing in gentle cycle and hang dry?
3.0,It is beautiful but the band is to short for women with wrist that are a little larger than the average.
3.0,I am a 2XL. The 2XL usually fits me a bit big but I rather it fit than not. This shirt runs small. It barely fit. Size up
3.0,Beautiful dress but I did not like the way it fit therefore I sent it back
3.0,"This dress is super cute and I wanted to love it! I wished that the pink in the floral pattern was more bright and less pastel. The top ran slightly tight in the bust and stomach, but it ran loose in the hips and thighs. I'm happy I bought the dress, but equally happy I didn't buy other colors because I have to wear shape-wear that flattens my boobs and stomach too much to rock this dress. I normally wear a size medium and felt the dress wasn't true to size. It was odd that the top was tighter than it should've been, but the skirt portion was too loose."
3.0,"I ordered my size based on the size chart. I like it, but good lord it's SNUG! I keep taking it off after wearing it for a couple of hours because I notice I'm breathing shallowly. I'm pretty skinny, barely a B cup. I usually have a problem with things being too big. The elastic is just so intense!"
3.0,"It’s very pretty, but clasp opens very easily"
3.0,"Bought these earrings for my granddaughter since she loves owl.  As soon as she put them on, one broke.  So disappointing.  I'm returning the broken pair and reordering them.  I hope we have more luck with the second pair."
3.0,"They definitely worked for their intended purpose, but I found that long wear on the grass damaged them. I will be unable to reuse them."
3.0,"If you plan on running or sweating in this, prepare for the metal button to irritate your wrist. I have a dry skin/itchy rash after about 6 months of use."
3.0,Flattering and good price for this quality. The shorts have a lining shorts and the top layer kinda inflates in water. Very annoying.
3.0,"The shorts are decent quality, BUT, the sizing isn’t so great. Super loose at the waist and if you have any sort of booty or thigh it will be super tight around those areas. I was looking for more of the opposite, right at the waist and loose at the thighs. Not bad shorts though."
3.0,"I write this not wanting to give this product such a low review score but I have to. The one thing I will say is the actual colors on the camp look great! Where things go wrong is with the size of the mask and placement of the ear straps. The mask is really big, so there’s a lot of floating space in front of my nose which lets in a lot of potential pollutants. Then because of where the straps are placed combined with the overall size of the mask it just floats down under my nose when I don’t want it there. I won’t throw these out because I like the way they look but I’ve had to purchase another product to give these masks the proper fit I’m looking for."
3.0,"Pants were very big, while top was small. More maroon than crimson, but still cute."
3.0,Comfortable but to small. These masks are like most the others that I tried. Just to small.
3.0,None of these are really useable aside from the one to use for buttons. The door opener is much too small to open doors. The wristlet is huge and falls off of my wrist. I wouldn’t recommend.
3.0,The fit was perfect but this shirt did shrink a bit when I washed it so the sleeves are in between full and 3/4 sleeve now. Which is ok if I just push them up a bit.
3.0,They run small- size up 2 sizes.
3.0,Ok product. The silver around the stone not as smooth as on the picture. Still pretty for a great price.
3.0,It’s a cute accessory. It’s cool they make it for multiple car brands. But the overspray of color on the metal scratches so easy- not a good feature on something like keys where metal is constantly banging up next to it. Also my Toyota logo button came crooked and when you’re OCD like me- it drives me crazy everytime I look at it. And the glue strings from the hot glue gun were stuck to it when it arrived so you really gotta question the quality.
3.0,I ordered a small and its still too big. I don't wear a small usually either.
3.0,The white version of this was just too thin and see through. I don't like when you can see so much through it. It wasn't completely sheer but it was pretty thin. The fit was okay. It was comfortable. It is too bad because I liked it otherwise and it seemed well made. Perhaps the black would have been okay. It is light.
3.0,Price little bit extra
3.0,Was a bit tight and short. Keeping due to able to wear with leggings.  Beautiful dress
3.0,"Very big for a small. Will need altered. Love the color, though, and the fabric is very soft."
3.0,It's smaller then 2mm  the 9&#34; was too big I bought this for a gift. But well made.
3.0,Fabric chinsey/- poor quality. Liked color and fit
3.0,"Ordered this based on reviews about how nice it was. And while I do agree that the fabric is very soft and comfortable, it is way longer than expected. I am 5'6"", 145 lbs, with long legs, so I wouldn't expect something that is advertised as above ut the knee to be down to my calves, but it definitely is. Longer than I would have liked, as I was looking for a sleep shirt not an old lady nightgown. I'll probably keep as a backup, but Im not sure how the review pics show it as way shorter than it is."
3.0,"The khaki color is actually a real fleshy peach color. You know, pastel orange-pink. It is not as pretty as in the pictures which is unfortunate and if it was a khaki tan I would have more opportunity to wear it. So far I haven't worn the cardigan out anywhere and I have had it for 5 months! It just isn't what I had expected it to be and I think the color I received is actually ugly. There, I said it. I just should have returned it.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769MJ87V/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5"
3.0,"It came and it's red, not pink. I'm wondering if I received the correct flavor? I guess she's 4 so she probably won't care, but when I order pink, I expect pink."
3.0,The chain is practically a choker. I didn't pay much attention to the sizes so I don't really fault the seller but the picture could have really been more indicative of the actual size. Its really short and the pic is a little sensationalized. The emblem is extra small but its tough(in terms of durability). I think its definitely more for a die hard female fan but nevertheless I still wear it on game day lol. I put the emblem on my own chain.  Overall it should be a bit cheaper given what you actually get. I think 7-9 bucks more reasonable.
3.0,"Looks just like the pictures. Love it. True to size.<br /><br />Edit 8/5/2020<br />I loved and wore this dress several times, and throughout those uses, I did find some things that bothered me enough to eventually get rid of it. 1. It was slightly see through. Even while wearing a nude bra, you could see the lines (I think maybe it stretches a bit over time?) 2. The material was so thin that, for me, you could see my rear end jiggle while walking, and if wearing a thong, it would definitely get between the cheeks (lol). These were problems for me because I liked this dress for work. I solved the second problem by wearing shape wear underneath, but I HATE shape wear. It totally ruined the comfort factor of wearing this dress."
3.0,"It fit more like a pencil skirt. I didn’t want the skirt to fit tight around my legs. My legs swell and look horrible, so I don’t need anything emphasizing them."
3.0,"SUPER CUTE!!! I'm 5'1 and 155lbs and 38d, the outfit was so pretty but was too big. I wear large or medium shirts and size 9/10 pants. The material could be better for it being 30$. Would buy it if they had a smaller size."
3.0,"This is a pretty pendant,  but it is a lot bigger than it looks in the picture. As such, it really can't be worn with just anything.  It is about 1.5&#34; tall by 2&#34; wide."
3.0,"5""6"" height, 140lbs.  Ordered large based on reviews.  Huge on me.  Even a medium would have been too big.  A small would have been much better.  Returned."
3.0,I like this product alot and would've kept it if it fit me but i'm a big booty girl and I felt that it looked a little too risque on me because at the time I purchased it I was a minor. I would recommend to others though.
3.0,"I bought these for a family member and he liked what they did but wasn't a fan of the style of frames, I returned them for exchange to a different frame but they were out of stock. Overall he said they worked and was impressed with what they do."
3.0,Poor quality- too small-  cheap cheap ccccheap
3.0,Has a cheap look to it and shiny. Just not what I was expecting.
3.0,One side started peeling and it looks horrible!<br />I have only used them 6 times since I bought them and I’m not happy with the way they look already. If I knew this could happened I would have bought a pair at the 99c store. I know it’s not possible to return them anymore but I sure hope they give me a discount so I can try a different style.
3.0,I ordered two in different colors. The dark blue one came out as the picture described and fits perfectly! The white one on the other hand definitely had some problems. The shoulder and chest area were stitched together 😑 silly manufacturing mistake. Something I can carefully cut apart but I mean come on really? Overall cute but would have gotten more stars if both came properly seen together.
3.0,The bottoms are TINY but the top is so cute it’s worth it
3.0,"Edited:  These masks shrink a lot.  I don't have the time or desire to air-dry my masks: they have to be wash and dry.  Even on low heat in the dryer, they shrunk enough so that they pull down when I talk.<br /><br />I am a teacher so I not only have to wear a mask all day, but I have to talk a LOT while wearing a mask.  I have spent over $220 trying different masks.  I wish I had found these first!  These pass the test:  the comfort test, the talking test, and candle test."
3.0,One of the lenses was loose right out of the package
3.0,I normally wear 42dd. Went ahead n ordered 44dd for room to grow since I'm only 7 weeks but it's a lil small. The design is very comfy. I thought my larger chest would not be supported but it keeps everything in place surprisingly. The wide straps are pretty awesome! My only complaint is that the material doesn't breathe. I wake up feeling hot n sweaty only where the bra is. Very strange feeling.
3.0,"I was looking for a dress to wear to an interview and the fabric is good for that.  the sleeve fit however, is off.  I don't ususally have issues with this, so that is what makes me think the dress isn't quite right."
3.0,Pretty. Just too big
3.0,This mask started to loses all the stitching after about the 3rd use.
3.0,Color too dark to be navy blue.
3.0,Material was less comfortable then I expected
3.0,They are nice but they did not fit. I am not sure how to order these to fit my earrings
3.0,"For the price, it's ok, but had to return it because it fit too small. The material is a bit on the thin side too. I'm 5'2&#34; 112lbs and the small was too small."
3.0,This fit my son weird. It was very wide and I didn’t end up having him wear it.
3.0,The case is as advertised.
3.0,"They are cute, but darn it don't use the silver backings that come with them I have lost  One of the diamond earrings and one of the blue crystals. Now I am using the rubber stoppers with the opals in hopes I don't lose anymore."
3.0,Black coating chips off easily
3.0,"I thought this looked like a cute pj set.  If you are not thin, not sure how much you'll like it.  The top is not too bad.  It is a little on the snug side, but the material gives and stretches and so it's kind of cute.  The shorts though, if your thighs are not thin, they will be snug.  And it leaves the shorts looking a bit awkward and unflattering, and they are not very comfortable that way either."
3.0,"I live in Central California and these are hot when it's 105, In winter, perfect."
3.0,"I am not very happy with the way this fits , The shoulder area is just not cut right so it is super tight in that area , the rest of the dress is bigger so unless you have really small shoulders and arms Im not sure if this will work for . The material is nice but  faded looking not bright , It is very long also. Was going to return but gave to my daughter who is a lot smaller and it fit better but still had a problem with the top looking right also."
3.0,"The right earring is very pretty and the left earring is very pretty.  However, the body of the dragonfly is not curved in the same manner on both earrings.  I am very disappointed in this, but will try to adjust and wear them anyway.  Quality control needs to be improved with this seller."
3.0,"Tight in the arms so it’s hard to bend but other than that, cute"
3.0,These  are not 20 inches  they are only 18
3.0,Very cute but is very small. Looks more like a jr size fit then woman's.
3.0,It was a little big and very wrinkled. I don't want to spend time ironing a blouse either so I returned it. It didn't look good and it looked nothing like the photo at all to me.
3.0,very large for a wallet. I was surprised by its size but it was well made and very pretty. had to return due to size.
3.0,Definitely not for sensitive ears. I wore them for around 6-7 hours and I could feel my ears stinging. Otherwise they are cute and lightweight but only buy if you don’t have sensitive ears.
3.0,"These earrings are super heavy. They looked lightweight, but I tried to wear them and didn't last but a few hours. Trying to return them is like pulling teeth. I'm still waiting on approval from the seller."
3.0,Nice low neckline that I was looking for.
3.0,This blazer is quite thin and comes with extreme wrinkles. It is shorter than a regular too.
3.0,The watch is beautiful and elegant.But the watch band is to small for me and there is no adjustments to make it bigger
3.0,Stone fell out when we used for the first time.
3.0,So the top of this shirt is very cute. The bottom part of the shirt look like it could for someone LX. Don’t understand how the top is super skinny and the bottom is super large. Can’t wear it with a skirt since the bottom look weird.
3.0,"I like the fit and nice, soft feel of the item however I received it in yellow instead of the aquamarine color that I ordered.  I needed to use it right away so I didn't bother returning it but I have hesitated ordering more because I am afraid of what I might receive."
3.0,At night it reduces the light flux more than I thought it would. Other than that its comfortable and pleasant
3.0,"Super cute and fairly priced, but keeps popping. I adjust it and wear it anyway!"
3.0,The light isn’t very strong and the marker quality is alright. Not the best but it works
3.0,"I love these pants, however they began to pill the very first time they encountered a rough material (i.e. brick bench).  I've owned these before and they've survived major falls with little wear to the material, so I was a little disappointed, since these seemed a little bit flimsier than my first pair.  Still a great purchase though."
3.0,"while the product was what I expected, the color is not 'black'. They are very grey comparatively."
3.0,They were too thin. I've lost 2 of them within a day
3.0,the sequins top is very small
3.0,Beautiful but it breaks easily.
3.0,When I first got this sweatshirt I loved it. It fit right in all the right places and was flattering. It’s on the thinner size so definitely wear a jacket over. Sadly I put it in the dryer and it shrunk in the arms. I ordered a medium. For reference I’m a solid medium in most clothes jeans size 8.
3.0,"This is an ultra cute swimsuit, but I wish I had ordered a Large instead of a Medium.  While this suit does fit, it is just barely.  I could wear it for a bit like at a pool for an hour or two (providing I wasn’t bloated for any reason even with the tummy control feature).  But certainly could not wear this under jeans and t-shirt while heading to the beach for a day, it would be too tight and confining for that.  With my being 5’6”, having a 36B top, 27” waist, and 36” hips I really thought a medium would fit me comfortably.  Not so.<br /><br />As far as the design, it is wonderful and I do like this suit especially in red. It does offer some tummy control and fits well in the bust and back.  The ruched sides really add some style for a 1 piece suit, and it is wonderful that the strap lengths are adjustable.  As for the quality, well for the most part it appears quite good with all the seams being double stitched.  BUT…. In the area where the pads would be removed I did find in one corner a little hole where the lining fabric appears to have not quite reached the corner seam when it was sewn in.  (See last photo). I hadn’t tried to remove the padding, was just looking to find the area where it could be removed if I ever decided to.  This little hole should not affect any of the functionality of this suit in water, and in looking at the fabrication of the lining, I’m not even sure that the hole would get any bigger.  But it’s still there.  And it is this type of little defect that is often not seen right away upon first inspection.  Had I not been curious about where the cup padding could be removed, I might not have seen it.<br /><br />So although I like this suit, just wish it would have fit better and not had that little defect."
3.0,"Very small, should have sized up 2x"
3.0,"It's definitely sheer, but I expected that much when wearing outfits like this.<br />Just find some skin tone body shapers or bra and underwear and you should be good.<br />Order a size up. I ordered an XL because im a little more curvier and its still a little too tight.<br />Its cute tho!"
3.0,"These feel great, but out of the 5, 2 ripped at the seam after one wash. The other 3 are still good and I love them, I only wish all 5 held together I would have given a score of 5 star"
3.0,"I own quite a few of these sweater vests and have to say that this particular one is the best quality of all of them.  It is thicker and appears more durable (haven't worn it yet, it just arrived).  However, the size is not what matches up with any of my others.  It is larger than the other dozen or so that I've ordered from here on Amazon.  I ordered a Medium, but am pretty sure this one is a Large.  I say &#34;pretty sure&#34; because unlike allllll of my other sweater vests THIS one does not have a size listed on it...anywhere.  So, I am torn during this review, which is why I am giving it a 3 star."
3.0,The designs are cute but the Namaste shirt itself had two holes in the back of the shirt that weren't noticeable with the burnout design until I put the shirt on.
3.0,Top shrank the first time I washed it :(
3.0,"These are as comfortable as any plastic flipflop would be - with the added benefit of the massage sole. They are very long, though. My heel is no where near the end and it is a bit awkward navigating stairs and the gas pedal for driving. But certainly good enough for the price."
3.0,"I so want to love this dress - the fabric print is cute, is has pockets, a side zipper and a liner, but it is like 2 different size dresses in 1!  I got it in XL, the top portion is like a size 8-10, and the bottom (from the waistline down) is sized like a 12-14. The pockets are set very high.  Overall, a disappointment."
3.0,Didn’t fit right. I am big busted
3.0,"I like it okay. The only thing I wish was different is that the rope wasn't so long. It is adjustable but even as tight as it will go it is still longer than I generally like. But that's just a personal preference. Overall it's a cute necklace, and comparably priced."
3.0,"Suit was great. But it has a racer back. I could not get into the suit.<br />Returned through UPS. Refund credit immediate. Great response from the seller. I did purchase another Delmira suit, with a scoop back. Fits great, very comfortable."
3.0,"I would give these a solid three stars.  They look exactly like the pictures, which is great.  I don't normally go for mirrored sunglasses, so that was something to get used to for me.  I took off one star because the lenses rattle when it's windy or you turn your head too fast.  I took off another star because they are already ruined after having them for about a month and a half.  Admittedly, partly my fault: I went to a mineral spring and wore them around during the day.  In the afternoon, I wiped them down, and the film on the outside to make them mirrored smeared off partially, so when I'm looking around and wearing them at the same time, I see different colors.  This is disorienting and I'm concerned that the polarization might be ruined some as well, so I decided to purchase new ones.<br /><br />Overall though, if you don't mind them rattling and are careful with them, these are a solid pair of sunglasses for cheap."
3.0,These seem to be much more cheaply made than a pair that I tried of my friends. The tint is not very dark either.
3.0,One of the pearls fell off before I could wear them.🙁
3.0,"My daughter, who’s about 5’8” and 175 liked the fit and feel of the outfit. It fit well length wise and wasn’t a butt crack shower.  The pants material is too thin for a fuddy-duddy like me, but she had no negative views on it at all."
3.0,Seems to fit on my feet although my size is 9 but have to buy size 9.5 instead due to inavailability but it doesn't look too big on me. I haven't tried it to walk far but it seems it has good enough tracking on the sole.
3.0,Got a hole in the heel after about two months of wear.
3.0,"The design on this bra is beautiful. The quality is excellent. I bought size 34D, and I must say even for my breasts which are more between cup sizes C and D, this cup is a bit short, meaning, my breasts feel like they're falling out of the top of the cups.<br />The clasp has 3 levels, and the straps are comfortable. I like the delicate designs on the cups and the cute bow on the front between the cups, but I won't find much use for it due to the cup being so low. I've purchased MANY Heidi Klum bras and this is the first one with which I've had this issue."
3.0,How I can remove several links.
3.0,"The pros of this shapewear is that it really does feel fairly comfortable. It also provides a smooth line and smooths down some lumps and bumps. The cons: It didn't do much for my poochy belly and it flattened my bottom a tad. Still, I would wear this for a special night out."
3.0,"I have worn socks from this company since I was in elementary school, some 60 years ago. At that time they were all wool and had a tendency to fall down. Over the years they added more and more elastic to keep them from falling down but the quality was still so good that I have 10 year old socks I have just recently started darning.  The last pairs I purchased were about 3 years ago, they were a Medium, well made, and fit perfectly. The amount of elastic was just enough to keep the socks up without cutting off my circulation. This time there were no medium size socks available so I bought the large size. I was very surprised to find that they were smaller, tighter, and thinner than all of my older socks that were a size Medium. I wear a 9 1/2 shoe, large should have been bigger than a medium, not smaller."
3.0,I’m going to exchange this in the hopes of getting one that looks like the model that was used to show this bracelet
3.0,"Not bad, fog up pretty quickly though."
3.0,Theyre ok kinda  flimsy
3.0,The earrings are nice but from the picture I thought they would be larger.  I should have checked the measurements.  I think they're like inch and a half.  I was hoping for at least 2 1/2 inches or more.  I love wooden earrings and the bolder the better! These are very light weight as to not weigh your ears down.
3.0,The waist in the medium pants is extremely small. The elastic was twisted before I even put it on. The top is perfect. The material of the set is soft. I wanted to return it because of the pants. I was given the option to be refunded $5.00 and keep it or return it . The return process is complicated. I chose to just take the $5 credit and where the shirt. They never replied!
3.0,"These masks look good and the material feels nice, but it is hard to breathe with them on. I've had other cotton masks that were much more breathable. I like the nose wire and the adjustable ear loops. It's an ok deal for the price and the amount of masks you get, and they would be perfect except they're not as breathable as I'd like."
3.0,Was way too large for my ear. I have smaller ears than most people.
3.0,It's pretty and well made but runs small in the cup.  I ordered a 38G and it's at least 2 cup sizes too small. I do like that it came with an extender for the band but the band wasn't the problem for me.
3.0,Pretty pattern and colors.  Fits well.
3.0,way too smalls
3.0,This was tighter than I had hoped buy still cute. I just need to lose my holiday weight!
3.0,"They are just OK because they do fog up. I used a liquid anti fog (spit) - they would fog up in about between 30 to 45 minutes. I have tried toothpaste, same results. I am using them for ATV riding. They fit great. The size is great, no blind spot and wide view."
3.0,Sizes run quite small. 9.5 for like an 8.5
3.0,the shrit's cute but the fabric is kinda thin and the color is a much blighter green then i excepted.
3.0,The plastic straps aren’t very sturdy
3.0,It's just what you expect it to be like but it feels comfortable
3.0,Not USSF. Should work fine in most cases. Customer service was accommodating when contacted.
3.0,I usually wear an XL but ordered a med. It's cute but not made of 95% cotton/5% spandex. It's rayon. I am returning it since I don't deal well with rayon.
3.0,"At least my loved one liked it.<br />It's not engraved, just printed.<br />I hope the printed stuff will last long enough."
3.0,"Good quality dress. I'm a 4 normally and ordered the small, which fit perfectly. I didn't, however, like the style. The neckline was closer to my neck than anticipated, and the hemline longer. Overall a very pretty dress, just not for me."
3.0,"Too big, and small pockets"
3.0,"Very pretty, good quality and I love the studs. However, where the strap attaches to the bag itself is a place in the middle so the bag wanted to spin around instead of staying upright. Within 5 minutes I dumped the contents of the bag on the floor by accident, so return I did. Sad me"
3.0,Interesting style.  Quick ship.
3.0,"This vest looks good on line.  It was running small, made of very thin material, and the fringe was twisty.  I quickly passed it ti my niece."
3.0,Looks nice but not as I was expecting. Only two pockets and they do not provide alot of room. Bag looks roomier than it really is. Strap has come undone a few times.
3.0,the band should be made a quarter inch longer for men because they have bigger wrists and this one barely fits
3.0,They are ok. They fit a bit small in the upper legs. And they seem a bit short too. I’m very average in leg length and things usually fit normal or long on me. So it was strange to get pants that are above the ankle.
3.0,Nice But They are expensive
3.0,"Cute, fit well, don't feel or look cheap. Until you wear them once...I wore them out on the lake on a jet ski and a slight amount of water sprayed on them and by the end of the day the shiny part of the lense was coming off :/ I like them a lot and the shipping was great and well packaged but check out the picture I really can't wear them more than once :/"
3.0,"I like the shirt, just wish the V was lower as pictured....more like a crew neck"
3.0,This is a cute top but it just didn't look right on my body. I am around 5'6 and 125 lbs. I typically wear a size medium in tops so that is what I selected. Unfortunately it's quite big and just hangs off me. I'm not sure a small would have been any better because the medium is quite snug in my armpit area. The shirt is made of 100% polyester so I don't believe it will shrink any in the dryer. I might give it a try though.
3.0,Not much flexibility in different sizes.  They are really large.
3.0,No compression to speak of and too short. I am 210 lbs and 5'10&#34;  I bought medium size. I  wanted tight for compression to help my back pains. Time to go back to Nike and UA.
3.0,"Cute rings and my daughter loved them, but they turned all of her fingers green.  They took a week longer then expected to get here."
3.0,It's cut all stupid
3.0,Cute. Very small. Donut did fall off after only a month.
3.0,The size was not true but it Makes a great tank top
3.0,"The polyester fabric is beautiful, color is spot on to the picture but this dress runs VERY small and is not the flowy fit the picture indicates. This dress is form fitting - so much so that I wondered if it’s even the same dress but the cut is the same. I guess you just have to be a stick shape to wear it."
3.0,This item was great at first.  After one wash on gentle cycle they had holes in the area where the front and crotch is sewn together. I checked. All pairs and they were the same.  Had to throw them away. Not a good buy.
3.0,"The socks look great, however I probably wouldn't recommend buying them. I'm a women's size 7-7.5 and the fit itself is fine, but the actual socks are SOO thin. I'm wearing the colored squares pair for the first time today and I can already see some threads coming loose, and can see my skin through the sock. They aren't pulled tight or anything. The toe and heel seem to be reinforced with an extra panel of fabric, but I expect the rest of the sock to fall apart shortly. It's a shame since they are super cute and colorful, but I would recommend spending a few more bucks on a better brand."
3.0,Nice but cheap quality
3.0,It got here quick and super beautiful but the earrings broke the 2nd day. The loop that holds the earring cracked.
3.0,"A solid 3.  It's what you pay for.  The metallic silicone rings are no where near decent looking.  The camo is good, so are the solid color grays and blacks and striped.<br /><br />I'd say from a feel perspective they size okay, the texture of the rings feels a bit rigid in the sense it's not smooth and soft like my other silicone rings.<br /><br />The image provided is misleading please see my attachments for accurate colors."
3.0,"I like the scrubs, for was snug, sent back for larger size"
3.0,It so cute but 0 to 6 is super big for a two month old more so for like a five month old.
3.0,"I like it, but the weird glasses pocket hits me in the face when I look down. lol. definitely annoying enough to not want to use..."
3.0,"I thought I'd love this. I don't have many yellow shirts so was excited to find a nice bright yellow. However, this shirt is overwhelming to the eyes. It's huge and has no shape at all. As a standalone blouse it is not good because it's just too much. I wore it under a black cardigan and it looked nice. It toned the shirt way down, which is necessary. My 10 year old said, ""Mom I can't can't even look at you in that shirt. My eyes."" I asked why and he said there's just too much happening on the shirt. I absolutely agree with that. So wear it under something. I also had to do a little stitching on it to make it look more fitted and give it some shape. Big fluffy yellow sack is not a good look."
3.0,Fits right in withmy field work.
3.0,"I loved this key ring, but unfortunately several crystals fell off just in one month. I would never buy it again."
3.0,"I like these metal magmatic Watch bands.  They are very easy to put on.  The color is way off on this red, however.  It’s much, much darker than portrayed in the photo and looks terrible with my new Red Apple Watch!"
3.0,"I usually wear a Medium in these Type of dresses. I ordered a large and a medium to try and see the difference. The large was way too big and the medium was a little too snug for me. I have a postpartum belly and thought this would cover it, but even with the tie in front it didn’t seem to hide it. The army green color is nice though and might work better for someone not trying to hide a little belly."
3.0,"Pros:<br />It's easy to put on and take off.<br />Looks great on the ear (nice and bright).<br /><br />Cons:<br />It might be because the earrings are 14k gold, but they are extremely malleable and fragile. First time taking them off, I accidentally bent part of the earring and had to bend it back into shape, so the earrings would close properly.<br /><br />The clasp/locking mechanism that keeps the earrings closed seems pretty weak. I'm scared that if someone was to brush my ear or if it was really windy, the earring might fly off my ear without me knowing..<br /><br />Overall:<br />I've only received this earrings for a day, and will be planning on wearing them tomorrow for the whole day. So I will see then if the locking mechanism is stable enough to endure the tumbles of daily life.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After wearing the earrings for one day, one of them broke in half...<br />Thought this would happen given how thin the earrings were. Kind of sad that this happened."
3.0,"Great piece - got tons of complements on it, but after 3 years the stones started falling out."
3.0,The gold was kind of peeling off it but it u soak it In cleaner it should fix it wouldn't wear if u just got your bellyring peireced though.
3.0,It is a beautiful dress and looks just like the picture but the chest has no support what so ever. So unless you have a small chest I would not get this dress.
3.0,The shirt splits apart. It is not connected. Cheap material.
3.0,"Nice print, but is not durable, in less that two months it came apart."
3.0,Rough material
3.0,I ordered this for a 4th of July getaway with my boyfriend. I ordered an CO which is my normal size due to being busty and wide hips. Unfortunately the dress wasn't the breathable cotton I was hoping for but more like a thin polyester type material. The dress was also snug at my bust but too big everywhere else including length. Looked like a summer moo moo my grandma would've worn.😕
3.0,came undone third wearing
3.0,"These do not stay up up very well.  They ae not good to use as a face mask for Covid protection, but they are not advertised as so either.  They do fall down a lot - I wish they had elastic or something to hold them up."
3.0,The color was very pretty but the suite didn’t fit. Also somewhat cheaply made. Would only last one season. It will be going bqck
3.0,"3 stars because while quality it’s great, the item I received is not the way it appears in the photos. The front is very short, cropped right under the breast line, so you must wear something underneath or else your entire abdomen is bare. That’s disappointing"
3.0,"I ordered the jean overall shorts with black and white striped t shirt. I received jean overall PANTS and a GRAY t shirt. The set is cute and my daughter will wear it come fall (if I decide to keep it), but I am extremely disappointed that I did not receive the item in the pic of my order."
3.0,They are on the small side
3.0,"I purchased the XL. The biggest problem I had with this cardigan was the quality. There were multiple long threads where the fabric had ended but the machine stitching kept going and were not trimmed/finished correctly. Many of the seams were wrinkled when sewn so they didn't lay smooth and flat. On the positive side, the fabric was nice quality, similar to the rayon spandex maxi skirt material. It was stretchy and flowed around the body nicely. I wear a M-L in womens tops and the cardigan fit well across the shoulders and larger through the body due to it's style. I tried it on over a long sleeve waffle knit top and the sleeves were a little tight, it was a bit of a tug to get the sleeves in the right position. The pockets were positioned along the side seams so when you put your hands in them, the fabric stretched really tight across the butt. Overall I wasn't particularly impressed so I returned it."
3.0,I got a pair of these to wear under summer tops - I am so tired of fighting bra straps.  I am a 38D so I ordered the size that corresponds to that.  These did stay in place for many hours (4?) and did provide some support - but they were way too small.  If I had been wearing any sort of a form fitting shirt - I cannot imagine how odd I would have looked.  The line of my clothes would have been completely bizarre.  I since ordered another pair that was 2 times bigger and hope they will work better.
3.0,Nice but a little too dark!
3.0,"This was really cute, but the sizing was a bit weird. Definitely size up at least two sizes from what you are. Also the bottoms were a bit short. I'm 5'3, and they still fit me above the ankles. Only keeping it cause it's cute."
3.0,"I don't like the extra material on the right side of the zipper area.  I guess it is supposed to be a ruffle, not!!!<br />It does fit nicely and adds a pop to my jeans or work slacks."
3.0,I really liked this dress but it was a couple of inches too long for me
3.0,It's cute...but somewhat too small.......a smart buy...just get one size up
3.0,Fits ok but not very good for compression shorts
3.0,"This pearl chain necklace is very pretty, however, the quality that I was expecting just isn't there. Several of the pearls were dull and didn't match the luster of the others and, the chain's durability is questionable. Its lobster claw style clasp should have made putting it on yourself easier but this was not the case; it was stiff and hard to get open.<br /><br />The necklace is choker style but has a 2"" extender, making it a bit more versatile. Although I ordered it to match the same style of earrings (which I already have), it does go nicely with a simple pair of single pearls.<br /><br />Despite my opinion on its overall quality, this necklace is still lovely, packaged nicely, and could make for a nice gift."
3.0,Picture looks bright yellow but was pale yellow. Also was narrow!
3.0,This is a beautiful bracelet however it is very small.  No bigger than a dime.  The bracelet is very small and appears fragile.  Not sure how it's going to wear.
3.0,"The style is perfect. I have been searching for a chunky black sweater. But the material is fairly itchy and after wearing it for 8 hours at work, I could not wait to take it off. Not sure if washing it helped"
3.0,I ordered the black/grey sunglasses. When they arrived they’re listed as black/grey on the box. But they’re very much so brown when you look through them. The world is sepia tone. I love the sunglasses. But was not happy given that sepia tone glasses tend to make me a bit nauseous
3.0,Sizes run kind of small
3.0,The black one fits too small. The red and grey fits perfectly
3.0,"It looks very nice and pretty as a prop, but functionally it isn't the best. It is too easy to press the button on the side accidentally and cause it to start making noises. I think maybe they should have designed it so that it will only make a noise if you press the button when it's open. Also, I thought I would be able to use this as a real watch as well, but it doesn't keep time accurately at all. The second hand was sticking, and when I looked at it the next day it was off by hours."
3.0,"Stone appears white in photos but is actually light pink. Very delicate, hoping it lasts and doesn't break. Still very pretty"
3.0,Looks orange instead golden
3.0,"They are classic black. Very dark, and sticker says polarized. Hoping it’s true. Cheap feeling. Feels like I could snap them opening and closing. Price for sunglasses I tend to lose easily is why I got them. Recommend for those who aren’t looking for strong durable glasses. These will be my go to for traveling and not worried about losing. Priced just right!"
3.0,"Love the design, don't like that they all have little metal shards where it looks like they were punched out and not filed down. Every piece I made an earring out of I was clipping of pieces of metal. Probably wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Can't wear as a necklace or a bracelet. It's too coiled up.
3.0,This playsilk is great for peek a boo and other imaginary play and dress up. My only complaint is the silk is rather thin and I don't think it will last too long.
3.0,"These are a little on the heavy side. They are certainly beautiful, but they pull down on the lobes a little. Don't buy them for your child, like I did. Even on my ears they pull forward and down slightly. On hers, they practically fall out in front, even with the back attached tightly."
3.0,"I was steaming the dress for the next day funeral that we were traveling 6 hours to and realized the left seem was actually not running up the left side but had been ran from the side up into the middle of the back. luckily I was able to get it to a Seamstress and she had to rip out the whole left side and resew it correctly. I was not happy with this product although when it was fixed it was a beautiful dress on, but I had to spend extra money on it to be fixed!!!"
3.0,"These LitLaces Polyester Shoe Laces are very basic. They aren’t extremely strong feeling, they are rather thin, and just don’t feel like the quality is there. I had gotten them to replace an older pair of laces on a pair of my Nikes, but they are so flimsy in that sense, that I decided against them, that I’d go buy another pair from a different store to use. The laces in shoe stores are typically cheaper than these, and tend to be much better quality overall. So not really satisfied with these for me and my needs, but for others these might be a good simple option for you. Just not something I’d personally use or recommend for more expensive sneakers."
3.0,"I mean it’s ok. Didn’t change the color of the leather at all, so that was nice. But honestly I don’t notice a difference in water resistants though"
3.0,Runs big. Nice. Warm. Runs big.
3.0,This fabric is incredibly soft unfortunately it's to see through so I'm buying another one to layer it. It would have been perfect if it was a little thicker so that it wasn't so see through. I also have to go up one size.
3.0,Not the standard size... an extra large in most tops would be small in  this one
3.0,"This bangle set is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.  She was invited to a traditional Indian festival.  A friend gifted her with an outfit for the event, but she needed some fun bangles and jewelry.  We found these.  They are super fun.  The quality is for stage or for fun dress up.  These will not pass for true gold jewelry, as they have a rose hue.  They are light weight and make that bangle sound. The various designs make them versitile for any festival event."
3.0,I order two white and two black. The order is complete and conform to the description. They sent all in one small package that does not close. Does the company could not packed in two separate boxes for orders of two other things!
3.0,It’s not good change black and sore my ears didn’t worth it waste of money
3.0,"I am only giving this 3 stars because I feel like this item is overpriced. I understand you as a costumer need to pay for shipping, time to make the product, etc. I just think this should be around $20-$30.<br />However, I am excited to try this in October on my wedding day. I feel like I will be happy with it and it will make using the restroom easier."
3.0,"I had high hopes for these socks. I only wear merino wool socks to help keep my feet from staying damp. I struggle to believe these are actually made from merino wool because they feel nothing like any of my other socks, nor do they perform like my other socks. Still, they are fine enough to wear when I need this type of sock so they'll do. Won't likely buy again."
3.0,Great product but our chain broke the 2nd day we had it.
3.0,"Bought 2 pairs, grey plaid and black. Grey were great:fit well, nice fabric. Black were a completely differnt fabric thats more polyester than not and bad fit. Got both in medium (im about a size m/ 5-8 depending) grey were almost loose and black where so tight i cant pull them past my hips. Bottom line, okay pants not going to return but not buying from here again until theres a guaranteed quality across styles"
3.0,The dresses material is not good. The lining of the waist is off and it is much longer than expected.
3.0,The leggings were loose and my little has some chunky legs. The turquoise was a a royal blue and that was super disappointing!
3.0,I’d say about half the bag was awesome / cute charms for kids. The other half were unknown and/or not child appropriate.
3.0,The scales for the sizes are not accurate.
3.0,"This hat is not white nor is it off white, it is a funky yellowish color. Very disappointed. The quality is good and it fits alright. But if you are looking for a white one, keep looking."
3.0,Great! Worked well for what I wanted.
3.0,It was a little tight since I'm a big chested girl. Fits well otherwise.
3.0,"kind of bulky shape, but overall is ok, a cute blue-ish stone."
3.0,No son muy elásticas pero se filtra bien el aire
3.0,Very shiny sparkly plastic
3.0,i ordered my size but it is still to small
3.0,Broke right away but looks okay :/ good for the price.
3.0,"I'm 6'0"" and thought I'd try this costume for obvious reasons 🦒. I bought an XXL, usually a size 10 or M/L (US). It technically fit over my body, but it bubbled out from my low back so it was just a straight line from my shoulder blades to my butt. Any tall woman who's taken a risk on a bodysuit knows what I'm talking about. I thought I might be able to take it in at the waist if this happened, but it's so stretchy I don't think that'd help. The torso is just not long enough if you're actually a giraffe 😌"
3.0,Rather stiff fabric even after washings.
3.0,They are really cute but two of the earrings were broke. Not worth sending back. My earrings never match anyway!
3.0,"Very flimsy rubber, the top flops over because it can't even support itself. You'll need something stiff to glue it to. It's beautiful otherwise, but I was under the impression it was usable right out of the bag."
3.0,"No son muy cómodos, pero son lindos"
3.0,"The material is soft, but the size is too big. I am 5'1 and 118 lbs. I normally wear size S. So, I've ordered size S for this shirt. And that's the smallest size I can get. However, it's way too big for me still. So I have to return it."
3.0,Loved them but somewhat small
3.0,Shirt fit funky and it was a bit brighter in person. Warm though and the bottoms fit well.
3.0,Size is relative but it is smaller than my thumbnail.<br /> i had figured it would be small.....but it is very small.<br /><br />It does come with a nice box. But it is so small it is put in a tiny bag inside the box.
3.0,its good for price but very small and not sturdy
3.0,"The shirt I received was the same flower print, but the sleeves were scalloped and barely there."
3.0,Fabric is thicker than a t shirt but order a size up Large is more like medium
3.0,There are two pieces of plastic on the ear loops. Once those come off you cannot adjust them to stay on your ears.
3.0,The quality was fine but it was larger than I expected (my fault...the dimensions were properly stated).  The color was closer to a bright red than wine.  I'm returning it because of the color.
3.0,This is not bad just a little too sheer for me
3.0,They are great but one of them had a hole in it already.
3.0,"Product is as described.  The band is a little thin - so it flips, and also some of the sewing on the bands is off centered, also making it flip."
3.0,"It is the best I’ve found so far, but that doesn’t mean I  like it.  The best thing is that it doesn’t have those ear ties that knock my hearing aids off.<br />Breathing is surprisingly restrictive for being so thin but, no worse than any other I’ve tried.  Actually, on cool, windy days it feels good around my neck"
3.0,"Well made, I feel that it doesn't hold what I needed it to. Larger would have been better."
3.0,Dress is very comfortable but the chest area runs small.
3.0,Doesn’t fit like pictures. Looks light and flowy. It’s not
3.0,"Love the polorization but the size was much bigger than advertised. I measured my old ones in comparison with dimensions given, and they came much bigger."
3.0,The earrings are very pretty. However it is difficult to put the backing on the earring when it is in my earlobe.
3.0,"I was so excited about these glasses, I wanted to love them, but when they arrived I immediately noticed that they are so awkwardly angled that I was to sit them far above my ears to even get them to sit right on my face. Total bummer for what otherwise would have been a really cute pair of sunglasses."
3.0,It’s very cheap and flimsy. The fabric isn’t even centered. But I wasn’t expecting a lot with this price!
3.0,"Beautiful , too small... I thought it was bigger and was disappointed when I saw it. I gave it as a gift and didn't see it until they opened the box, beware of size!"
3.0,"I wear a men's 10.5 / 11, depending on the brand shoe, but my feet are also pretty narrow.  I generally have to pull the laces pretty tight on most shoes.  That being said, I tried on size 11 and 12.  For size 11, my toes were pressed against the front of this boot while the sides felt a bit loose.  The stiff housing made it impossible to tighten around the legs and compensate for the loose sides adequately.  Size 12 was just too big."
3.0,Not what I expected. This looked weird on me. I was hoping to wear this out but it looks like night gown. Each pattern is individually attached so it looks a bit tacky. You can see the seam and its odd. Did not notice this on the model.
3.0,"Shirt is great but instead of a men’s xxl it’s a 3x and looks like it would fit a kid, not an adult."
3.0,Item was everything vendor said it was.<br />It took 7 or 8 days to receive item.
3.0,"The necklace that came with this is so cheap - and no matter what color top you buy, you get the same &#34;necklace&#34; which looks like a child made it - will never wear necklace. Ordered peach and pink and the necklace on the display is NOTHING like pictured -"
3.0,The color of this this shirt is very pretty but the fabric is very thin. It fits tight so every bulge or bra strap will show through.
3.0,small buzzing in speaker is bad.
3.0,It is nicely made but was too small! I ordered the 6-12 months and my 10 month old baby could not fit into it!
3.0,"Such a great print but made with flimsy rayon. Does not feel like it will last long and always wrinkled. Jake says, “Aw, man! That is not the bees knees.”"
3.0,Smaller then I thought ! My fault should have paid attention to demensions. But made well
3.0,"These are decent, although there were some flaws in the design - random splotches that looked like bleach spots."
3.0,Looks really nice but the second hand is INCREDIBLY loud. You could hear it easily across the room.
3.0,It looks very nice .... a little more masculine than I expected.... very hard to adjust.... I'm wearing on my thumb
3.0,"The feathers were broken upon arrival.  The box the came in is beautiful, as is the design, but the product itself is damaged."
3.0,I have strawberry blond hair and this product looks great with my hair. While this product says one size fits all I am heavier set and it doesn’t exactly look as good as a smaller person!
3.0,"Not enough instructions on how to put it all together. Good thing youtube exists. The material is cheap, but I expected that."
3.0,Nice color and addition of lace but it was too tight.
3.0,Earrings were cute but poorly made. First pair arrived broken. Ordered a replacement and it arrived broken as well. The earring came loose from the post that goes into the ear both times.
3.0,Doesn't look like the picture it is more just a skinny little white ring with the tiniest bit of gold around it
3.0,"Cute, lightweight, so you could comfortably wear it all day IF it DIDN'T slide down constantly! Needs a nose clip. The white cotton is bleeding through the black front, so it looks dirty even though it's only been worn twice."
3.0,It's too big for a small Thinking about sending it bck
3.0,I wear a large in shirts.  Therefore I ordered a large in this shirt.  It fit across the chest but if you are looking for a long shirt then order up a size.  That may help.
3.0,"I don't know why I didn't realize that the clear plastic would not be easy to breathe through. The plastic shield fogs up quickly, which makes it a little difficult to see mouth movements. I am thinking about giving these away to someone who might really need them for a very short-term use, because I am not sure I will use these."
3.0,hopefully the screws wont get loose
3.0,I like these boots but they have zippers and it's just a matter of time before they are broken
3.0,The velcro on this shoe lasted maybe a month and a half before it wouldn't velcro anymore...I though if I spent a little more on shoes rather than buying them at walmart they may last a little longer but I guess not.
3.0,"These boots were not only received in the wrong color, but had a weird &#34;baggy&#34; fit around the ankles.  Maybe it's just me, but I had to return them either way."
3.0,Bought the green color and it fit perfect! So cute...pink was HUGE
3.0,"The hat is lightweight, color is nice and bright, and the material quality feels pretty high end  however, I still got dark after wearing it the whole day... so I have doubt if it really does work in blocking the UV like it claims ..."
3.0,"Thin material, so it nice and cool without being see through. It’s VERY clingy - so I didn’t feel especially pretty in it with any extra rolls 😣 it hangs kind of weird and wrinkles easily, but is a good<br />Length<br />To wear with leggings.  I wouldn’t buy again."
3.0,"It’s a cute apron and hat set, I wish it was a plain cotton material. The material is not the best texture, of my daughter doesn’t like it I’ll donate it to her daycare classroom, it will be great for dress up/play!"
3.0,"I am looking for a floor length maxi dress. After reading reviews and seeing pictures I ordered a medium.<br />Shipping was good, it arrived the next day. The dress fits nicely everywhere else as the size chart and people’s reviews state and is not see through, however, the one I received is not long AT ALL. It’s actually a “high-low” style....the front comes up to almost my knees and the back goes right below them. not lengthy looking like the pics they use or that others have posted about.<br />So I’ll have to return it and purchase elsewhere.<br />Very disappointed. I was really excited to wear this to my photoshoot."
3.0,Nice quality. Looks just like the picture. A little large in the opening for a smaller head. It was too big for my elderly mom and wouldn't stay on.<br />Minus is it sheds a lot.
3.0,"I like the necklace, it's actually titanium which seems to be hard to find online. I wish it was made better for 80 dollars. The rings that hold the clasp on the necklace aren't soldered and it gets caught in my hair. I truly believed it would be properly made, and I have bought other chains for less with all the finishing touches. I wish I didn't have to solder do it myself when I already spent 80 bucks."
3.0,I read several reviews about running small so I bumped up from XL to XXL.<br />Still too tight for my comfort. I rated 3 Star because the quality appeared to be very nice. Just disappointed that they ran so small.  Put it this way... if you are a beer drinker and over age 50 you are probably going to be disappointed.
3.0,Love them but wish they kept my hands warmer. Good for driving and quick outings. Good fit.
3.0,Very nice and looks warm but don’t understand how this can be 0-3 months.  My son finally fits it and is 4.5 months.  He is 50th percentile for height and weight.
3.0,"Not very sturdy and I'm not sure will hold up well, but looks great in person and I have already received a compliment on it the first time I wore it."
3.0,"Ok for the price. Two of them are very similar so might want to gift one set to a friend. Also didn’t particularly like the black set. Looked cheap and I may gift that set too. I did wear the colorful pair to work and got a compliment from a teammate. One of four I’d say were worth the money paid. If the goal is lightweight though, these earrings meet that requirement although I really wasn’t wowed by all four pairs of earrings."
3.0,I’m 5’10” I got an XL fit great except it looked like I was waiting for a flood.
3.0,On the picture it styles that this is a necklace. I was excited but when I received this it turned out to be the earring. Still pretty but not what I originally wanted. Please specify
3.0,"I ordered a large (5'll female 190 lbs), it fits snug. It is a cotton blend so it does stretch. It is also a bit short for me. I will still wear it and it is nice, but per the size chart does run on the tighter side. also the dress-line is closer to the bust than the picture. It is more empire than dropped. A bit disappointed about that, as I like a bit lower in the fit. Will still wear but not as shown in the picture."
3.0,I had planned to use this for my daughters wedding but the jacket just slips right off of the dress so it doesn’t really hang right. The jacket seemed to be a bigger size than the dress too.
3.0,Overall this sweater guard is a little on the chunky side. Because of this it does not hang well. i was hoping for something that was more delicate.
3.0,"These are cute, but way way to big. These should be about half the soze"
3.0,"Nice sweatshirt as I indicated in a previous review - BUT, the inside continually shreds black lint balls all over your inside shirt or tee and even on the back of your head, especially if you shave your head and have stubble.<br />Not sure how Russell can fix this but it's annoying to pick lint balls off yourself because the inside of the sweat has material that's inferior to a wash."
3.0,"The dress is very pretty . I found it about three inches too short in the waist line . I’m 5’5 1/2 , I’m sending it back"
3.0,When I open the packet they seems really small but once I put on was not so bad I would get a bigger size if i ever buy this again thou. But love the pants and the material too.
3.0,"I usually wear a small, but after reading some reviews, I ordered medium.  The medium wouldn't even get close to being able to button.  I had to return it."
3.0,"Looks sooo pretty in, just hurts to sleep on because the metal holding the gems is pointy."
3.0,"For the price, this was a killer deal! However, I am new to trading and some of these are OBVIOUSLY scrappers. If I can pick them out this easy, I'm sure those of you really into trading might not be so pleased... but most of these look legit, and at a fraction of the cost it's (probably) worth the risk. I highly doubt Disney employees wouldn't allow them to be traded in the parks (except for the scrappers maybe) so they are a good investment for that alone. Get some cheap ones, trade them for the good ones!"
3.0,VERY NICE COLOR.
3.0,These are okay earrings. I feel they are cheaply made and not for anyone with sensitive skin but there are a lot of options from 90s wear to holidays to simple.
3.0,"as I have gotten older, night driving has become less fun. these glasses make things a little clearer. the glasses reduce the glare from oncoming headlights. its not perfect but a little better."
3.0,Cheap. Don’t like the plastic clip on. Could break easily. Need a small case for it so the lens won’t scratch.
3.0,I normally don't by jump-suits as they are never long enough in the right places. This one was almost perfect except the cut in bust and rear areas not as good quality as it should have been for my taste. Having said that very cute jumpsuit and I will wear it with a few adjustments.
3.0,"I'm 5'1"" and this dress is longer than I expected. I know it says ruched but when I pull it up to my desired length it looks way too wrinkly. Despite this it still fits fine, but the bottom part is a bit loose. Still wearable, just not what I expected."
3.0,"It is soft, but a little thin, the light blue is pretty."
3.0,So I am a very comfortable size medium.. I have on spanks and binders to get this bad boy on.. if I bend my back I will rip the ripper pure off.<br />Other then that cute I suppose
3.0,"Cute dress, but very small through the bust and also very sheer. I returned mine."
3.0,"The kimono itself is pretty nice. It's a lightweight, shear material. Kinda similar to what a lot of swimsuit covers feel like. The colors are correct to the image and very vibrant. However, this way too small for a ""One Size"". It's more like Small-Medium. Maybe large at most. I'm a size 2x and most ""One Size"" products fit me, but this was so constricting when I put it on. I couldnt get both sides of the kimono to touch in front of my body. If you wear a Size L or smaller, I would recommend this. But otherwise, I wouldn't test your luck."
3.0,This is very well made but runs very large. I am a size 8 but this was way too big so I have returned it.
3.0,"I'm 105 pounds 5'3 and I bought a small. When the dress came in it was Large on my belly area and the sleeves were super loose! It seemed as if The dress was designed for fuller women. The material was definitely not cotton, I ended up returning it because it's a polyester material and was itchy against my skin. I needed this dress to go dancing but it was definitely not breathable. I'm still giving it a three star because it was a beautiful form, unfortunately not for my body type."
3.0,This onesie is Adorable! I loved it on my baby! He is technically 12M old however I bought the 18M size and I'm so glad I did because it fit him well however... the snaps on this onesie are useless.  Any slight movement the snaps popped right off.  I thankfully had him wear it with a pair of pants so it still looked adorable but if you just want them wearing the onesie be aware the snaps are not built for function.  After washing the Onesie it held up great - no issues with the decal coming off or looking damaged.  The onesie is super soft as well.  If it wasn't for the snaps I would have given it 5 stars but for the price - the snaps should have been functional...
3.0,"This outfit is super cute...BUTTT if you want anything to do with the sleeve portion of it, you must skip any type of arm day at the gym."
3.0,Very thin but nice shape
3.0,"I bought this in hopes for wearing for a rehearsal dinner, but it was a little bit too tight/ not exactly the vibe I was going for. The dress was form fitting and I just didn't want to worry that it was too tight (honestly may just be my own crazy in my head)  Will I wear it during the summer? Probably."
3.0,Pretty top...wish it had fit.  Size ordered and sent supposed to be 3x...it was not.  I would need to order 2 sizes larger for it to have fit.  Disappointed...
3.0,"As expected. Don't know how it will hold up vs time, but should suffice."
3.0,"Very efficient service, it arrived on the delivery date stated. What I really like about the suitcases is that it is extremely light weight and that it has two compartments in which to pack my stuff. Which was ideal for my intended travel."
3.0,"The edge was sharp and cut my wrist, so I had to hammer it"
3.0,Color is really not a true pink.
3.0,I had previously ordered the red and white cotton dress and I received so many compliments when I wear it. I am allergic to synthetics so this dress is a great go to for shopping or the beach or easy travel through the airport's. Unfortunately the black-and-white dress that I ordered just doesn't feel as soft or like 100% cotton. I am hoping that the more I wash it the softer it will become. It's also shorter than the red and white dress.
3.0,"The material is thin, not nearly as heavy as what I expected"
3.0,"beautiful ,little hard to figure out ,it stops ticking unless wound.. so ur time is off pretty though, I love the design n box ect. but the clock had a chip on the paint. Also how do you have a watch that doesn't always work???unless hand wound.. u have to find the right time reset it wind it up and after about 20 mins your a hour behind n its dead... watch= telling time, always ,effortlessly"
3.0,"This is not a very thick material.  It feels cheep.  I know it's a ""light weight"" shirt.  But, it's a little too light for me."
3.0,not what i wanted but they are nice socks i where them
3.0,"Very flattering and feels nice, however, it’s very fragile. Runs (like hose) if you pull too hard."
3.0,"Was well made  material wise ,gorgeous color but a 2x is really more like a large. I bought this from men's section now it is saying it's woman's unisex. My teenage son was disappointed."
3.0,"The hat did not look like the picture, it was a  nice hat. But not what I expected.  Packaging needs to be a lot better for this kind of hat, not a bag."
3.0,It was a nice style but sized very large..as a petite statured person the arms were crazy long as was the length of the sweater...i normally wear a med or large but a small would have been sufficient!
3.0,Handy to have around the house but could stand to be a little longer. Smaller than expected.
3.0,Zippers broke right away.
3.0,They only seem to be about 34 in in length. Also after just 2 days of wearing them the fleece pilled up terribly.
3.0,Lo devolvi.
3.0,"Cute, but neck come up a little too high. Good to wear at home."
3.0,They are too tight on my feet.
3.0,I do not like hanging things to dry that are heavy.
3.0,the size of the top is too large
3.0,Pants are cute but they run very big.
3.0,"This is far shorter than I expected it to be, it only comes down to a little below my knees and I am only 5’2”. The sleeves are also shorter than the pictures led me to believe. I bought the white lace “1051” color."
3.0,I love it even though it's bigger. Than it should be. Material seems decent and the customer service was great
3.0,Nice but material is no forgiving
3.0,"I usually wear a medium but ordered a large based on reviews.  I'm 5' 8"" 145 lbs.  The dress length was perfect for work but too tight in the hips & arms.  Had to return it!"
3.0,I love this watch but the clear didn’t last long and now it looks like trash. Wish I could return it.
3.0,I think they run small will return for.larger size.
3.0,"I have a hard time finding shoes, and gave these a chance since my Crocs had holes in them, and a friend said they were comfortable. I ordered a 10, but these shoes are narrow, and even made my toes go numb during the first month I wore them.  They still dig into my heels, so I have to wear bandaids or moleskin.  They also are not good for long walks, on hot days.  Your feet will hurt.  They also squeak.  But they are very cute, and they do not smell.  So if you can handle shoes with rigid backs, have narrow feet, and want a cute shoe, then buy.  If not, then don't."
3.0,"This fit a little too small and fit a whole lot wrong! It did not hide cellulite nor did it make the butt extra 'peachy', but it amplified the cellulite that is otherwise never seen in other leggings and had the other affect and made it look flat. But maybe worse of all is that they were SO ITCHY!! Just not for me, but maybe would work for those with an already curvy bum."
3.0,Great price and looks beautiful on.  I ordered a small because I have tiny hands and they are still pretty tight.  Took a really long time to arrive but all in all I'm satisfied.
3.0,I like these earring but they are on the heavy side for my ears and are a bit bigger than expected
3.0,"bought a red one last year, although not great in a deep freeze or a strong wind, love how it went under neck inside coat and around face.  No sizing, then bought a back one and at least one size maybe two sizes smaller!  Doesn't go down inside coat around neck, what the heck???"
3.0,"Nice style, though be aware that fabric is very thin.  The loops for the belt placed it higher than the natural waistline, which is not what I expected from the picture.  This makes the placement a little awkward on me, so I won't use the loops...and maybe not even the belt, which is huge."
3.0,"The belt is as advertised.  Everything functions more or less as promised.  The main issues I have are that the end of the belt is a straight strip of metal clamped to the elastic belt to prevent fraying etcetera.  For the price a bit of molded rubber sewn around the end would have been a much better alternative to a sharp bit of metal stabbing into you if you bend wrong.  The next issue I have is that the material itself is very abrasive  It feels like sandpaper if it rubs up against your skin.  The plastic buckle works well enough, but feels and looks kinda cheap.  Considering what you get and the comfort level if offers, the price is pretty high.  It will hold your pants up, but it's not extremely comfortable to wear despite the built in stretch."
3.0,just didn't fit the way I thought it would. Maybe it was just my body size
3.0,"Not as great as I expected.  Got a tiny hole in them buy putting them on this FIRST time.  I was extremely careful,  as they are so expensive.  Hanes are tougher than these for a fraction of the price. The top still tried to roll down, even ticked under my bra as directed.  They are pretty hose and do give good Tummy control, but I can't say they are any better than Hanes Alive.  I'm 5'10, 145 lbs, 36 inseam and bought the recommended size for my measurements.  I was really disappointed to see how very easily they got a hole by just very carefully putting them on. Especially after all the hype over the years.  Maybe the quality has gone down after they got famous."
3.0,"I ordered 3 of these dresses. I received one that my daughter loves, one was the wrong size, and the 3rd wasn't the correct dress."
3.0,* soft leather<br />* beautiful color<br />* no unpleasant odor<br /><br />Complaint<br /><br />It seemed larger in the photos on the listing.
3.0,Cute dress fits as expected. Not thrilled with the fabric. It is a polyester knit.  Why it is SUPER COMFORTABLE to wear it is not the aesthetically the most retro / vintage selection in my closet.  Works well as a travel dress.
3.0,I shouldn’t have been surprised.  The fabric was stiff so I washed but not sure about drying so I hung it up to dry versus machine.  The fabric is still rough feeling.  I guess I put too much stock in the relaxed look in pictures.  I was hoping for something softer and flowy.
3.0,These are adult sizes and the picture on them is very small and cheap looking
3.0,"Really cute! It's just a bummer that it is too small. I sized up, but it wasn't enough. I wear a 40D and I ordered an XXL. It is more like a large....maybe even a medium. It doesn't come any larger. I have been losing weight so I hope to get into it someday, but I may be giving it to my daughter as she is not as big chested as I am. Sometimes the &#34;girls&#34; just won't cooperate! Fall coat, lightweight."
3.0,"I'm a Jack Skellington/Nightmare Before Christmas nut and was happy to find this for the price. It is large, which is fine with me, and I like the bulky band, but one of the pins fell out after a few days. Thankfully I found it and was able to put it back in. The thing I am not so thrilled with is that the metal rivets that go through started to rust and left a welt on my wrist. I put nail polish over the metal parts and it helped. It's really good looking and comfortable, but alas, cheap."
3.0,"The pink is more of a neon coral, so the camo print isn’t very noticeable. Size medium fit perfect. It is see through. Overall it’s a good legging just too sheer and not the color I expected"
3.0,The jewelry is beautiful but the earrings are so difficult to take off. I always have trouble or need help.
3.0,The boots look amazing except had to send them back three times for sihe. Not at all try to sissies.
3.0,"these are very cute clogs but have a few flaws. first off they are very heavy....you expect clogs to be light and these were not at all. second off, the stickers...which i didn't realize they were stickers.... (the decorations) were easily removed by my curious 4 year old as she tried to see what was underneath....she just pulled off the decorations like tape. they are still functional and we will use them, but not exactly what i expected."
3.0,"Too tight in shoulders, bust, & arms for an XL."
3.0,The fabric is not of quality and is narrow
3.0,Not bad<br />Very heavy<br />A bit bulky
3.0,I bought this for my wife’s birthday.  Tennis racket pendant is very nice but you need a microscope to see it - a lot smaller than we were expecting.  The chain is equally very thin.  My wife decided to keep it but it didn’t give the wow reaction I was hoping for.
3.0,Nice Jacket light weight yet warm. Bought for my granddaughter who is Autistic. So for her everything has to be perfect and precise. So she noticed the threads hanging from various places. and the jackets padding protrusions from multiple seams. Belt looked a tad bit worn. Size true to fit.
3.0,I did not like the fit on me. Looks better on a thinner person. I ordered XXLarge. I normally wear a 16W.
3.0,The fit wasn’t horrible. The reason I returned it is because the lights didn’t work. I even went and bought new batteries for it. Then I had to pay $10 to ship it back because it has to be in a box due to the batteries.
3.0,The ring is like the picture very cute but I suggest you go down a size my ring didn’t fit..
3.0,"It looks very appealing on the screen, but the material is not so great."
3.0,It’s just the arm band lmfao don’t make the mistake I did thinking it a whole watch
3.0,This lounge outfit is gorgeous but top is too tight so returming.
3.0,Didn't fit my feet well at all. I purchase a lot of vionic shoes and these just didn't fit.
3.0,Slippery feeling. VERY th in...Not worth price super thin.... Less quality even than $7 Taget Walmart  Tshirts
3.0,"Not really excited about this item. Quality is good, however, was expecting it to be bigger. If I would have the opportunity to send it back I would."
3.0,"I bought these because of the value.  The advertisement was for &#34;Women Men&#34; so I ordered my size only to discover they are about a half size to a full size too small.  They stretch so it's not a big deal, but I can't wear them for any length of time.  If you purchase, you may want to size up."
3.0,Smaller than size indicates.
3.0,"It broke after my son played with it for 2 days.  Although, he's pretty rough."
3.0,I liked it a lot but will have to lose 20 pounds to wear it.
3.0,"I don't know why but this shirt is super itchy on the inside, outside soft, inside makes me want to peel my skin off."
3.0,"I really liked the swimsuit on the model and I figured that I would like it on me also, but unfortunately that was not the case. I liked the bottoms. They fit perfectly an were super cute, but the top fit me a little weird. Mind you, I'm a 36DDD so I need a little support in my top. The top was cute, but it offered the same amount of support as a bralette and I had a bit of a uniboob situation going on. It might look nice on someone with a smaller chest, but not so much on me."
3.0,"So wanted this shirt to work. I ordered the color called “pumpkin” which is more like a peach color in person. The fabric is really soft and fairly sheer. I loved the hemline, it has a hemmed, “raw edge”. Ultimately I had to return the product because it is SO BIG. For reference, I am 126lbs and 5’5”, average build. I usually like shirts cut like this but the arm holes were cut oddly, making them kind of baggy. Just an ill fit all around for me unfortunately. I was pumped to have found a shirt for so inexpensive with such great quality, but it went back."
3.0,Good value for the money but small
3.0,"They are very light weight, so I feel like I'm going to break them. But overall they are good. Unfortunately Amazon put stickers on the black case, that have left a residue that won't come off. So they ruined that."
3.0,one of the lens came out
3.0,"with the price being so low: I want inexpensive glasses to keep in each vehicle for when I don't have my good ones on me. Bought 2 different styles, nice looking, fair enough quality - especially for the low price. But if you need polarized lenses, DO NOT waste your money. Arrived very quickly from seller."
3.0,"This bracelet is way too big and you can’t adjust to your wrist size. However, the color or the stones and the quality is really good"
3.0,"I'm so sad. I really loved the old school foam gasket Barracuda goggles, they fit my face, never leaked and didn't leave marks around my eyes (quite useful if you are an aging woman). These ones have a nice seal if I put them on a dry face but leak like crazy if my face is wet. They do leave marks around your eyes. Unfortunately, if a little water gets in, they basically keep leaking the rest of the swim. However, if you have large eyes or wide set eyes, they are SO MUCH better than the expensive Speedo Fastskins one."
3.0,The Bottom two snaps came off after about a month of use. Not satisfied with the product because of this. Obviously should last longer.
3.0,"I purchased the watch for my grandson's 12th birthday and he loves it; however, the face is huge and it came with no instructions.  As near as I can figure the only control is for setting the time.  I haven't figured out what the large stem is for.  But my grandson is happy so I am too."
3.0,"Super beautiful dress. But, if you have a bigger chest, good luck! This dress what pretty, but a smidge small. Talk about side boob galore!!! I have a larger chest (real boobs) and they were hanging out the side like crazy! If you have fake boobs, it would probably look sexy- if that’s what you’re going for.... but for my real ones... not so much. (I wear a 34 DDD)"
3.0,"This is a nice sandal but I gave it a 3 star rating because the straps don't have a loop to go through. With a child continuously playing with them, they don't stay where they should. She then trips and falls."
3.0,Had this jacket for 2 months and the zipper does not zip up.
3.0,"This dress has nice cotton, and it is a pretty color. The top is not see through. It would be fine except it hung on me like a weird nightgown. It wasn’t flattering. I have a smaller waist and full bust, and it didn’t fit as an empire waist or at a natural waist! For that reason I returned it."
3.0,This product is very thin and not very long.
3.0,"Decent for the price, kinda thin, though."
3.0,Cute ring but 2 stones fell out already
3.0,Boot socks are a lot shorter then whats shown in the pictures.
3.0,"Soft and Like the adjustable straps, but this is long on my 5'3 frame! Can only use with tunic tops or better yet, at bedtime!"
3.0,"ehhhh, this dress just gives me a headache. i orderd up like recommended, and it seems to be a little big yet if i sized down i feel like i wouldn’t even be able to get it over my hips. maybe it’s jusy my werid body, but it is very big on the waistline and it is very short, even on me as a 5’0 person. this isn’t the worst dress, however if you are looking for a good overall dress, i would suggest you keep looking."
3.0,"So this is a nice watch and appears to be authentic MK, but the description is misleading. This is not a women's watch. It's definitely men's in my opinion (I have two MK women's watches and on mine where the watch clasps together its different, this watch has the clasp on the men's MK watches). I have tiny wrists so a men's watch is just too big even with links taken out. I had to return but it's a nice watch for the price."
3.0,Love the shirt but I would recommend going up a size. It's a little small in the bust area
3.0,"These are good glasses however needs to be more durable, one pair of glasses broke after one week!"
3.0,"It says coral, but it was actually lighter then the coral shoe. Could not be worn for the occasion..."
3.0,This is much tighter and smaller than what I had before. The license and cards are difficult to get out but could be due to having too many items in it. I'm hoping it loosens up as I use it<br />Overall I like the look and design..
3.0,"The fit is large towards the pinky toe, seems like the other toes are even and not to size. Overall the work okay."
3.0,"Not the best made, the straps broke off one already because of lose threads. The length is perfect, hits right at the top of the thighs.They are soft, stretchy and comfortable"
3.0,Honestly they were heinous but we used them for halloween
3.0,"This is a cute, stylish coat that is warm due to it's interior fuzzy lining.  The sleeves are long which was ok but the shoulders were just too small and tight, I wasn't able to move around.  I'm 5'5"" & 120 lbs. and ordered the medium.  It fit great other than the shoulders - I had to return it."
3.0,"One was too small, the next too big.  Didn't drape nicely."
3.0,"Is decent for the price... I don’t care for the big logo on the back and it fits a lil too loose. Not terrible, pretty much what I expected for a 3 pack at that price point. I’m 5”8 162"
3.0,"The neckline is much higher than in the pictures,  making the dress fairly frumpy on me.  The color was as shown and the length was good (I'm 5'10&#34;)."
3.0,"It's cute and I'll keep it but it's a lot shorter than it looks on the model and I'm usually a size small in everything. If I lift my hands up it shows everything so you definitely need something underneath The sleeves are long enough, which is nice. It also has metallic speckles throughout. I wasn't expecting that but it's subtle enough that it still looks nice. The only thing that's really bothering me is that it has a very chemical smell I'm hoping will come out in the wash.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was contacted by the company who told me they address these issues. They issued me a refund and are sending me a replacement. Once I get it, I will update this review with the new info."
3.0,fir small
3.0,"The chain broke the minute we took it out of the package. We were able to repair it after removing a portion of the chain (which was actually quite long). It is a lot bigger in person than I realized, and quite heavy (which is probably why the chain broke).  The blue paint is much darker than the advertised picture shows, and it started rubbing off in some places almost immediately. Still, it was a gift for my daughter, and she loved it. So, for a cheap gift for the young Whovian in your life, it's not a bad purchase."
3.0,"I like that it was easy to put on and you didn't noticed it. What I didn't like was you can only use it once, because once you remove one part where it sticks... it will never stick back.. you'll just having something uncomfortable dangling."
3.0,"I really like the way this pair looks. The earrings are a bit on the heavy side, so don't plan on wearing these for more than a few hours before your ears need a break. I like the necklace itself, but after just maybe not even a dozen uses and the clasp fractured and broke. I've bought a small pack of replacement clasps from Michael's, but it's just annoying to have your pretty necklace fall off during a party... It does certainly make you more noticeable, though: &#34;Hey aren't you that girl whose giant necklace fell off in the entree just an hour ago?&#34;"
3.0,"The pants were comically over sized but the shirt fit great. I ended up using some black dress slacks. Even ordering a size up, the hat was hopelessly too small. I guess it does the trick from afar"
3.0,Not real happy with this bag. It is nowhere near as nice looking as it is in the photo. It seems very thin and the inside is very crinkly .very disappointed .
3.0,"It took about 2 month to even get this sweater delivered.<br />It is an OKaYish sweater. I think I like the picture of it more than the actual sweater itself.<br /><br />It fits fine, the material is kinda rough feeling, the color's are nice..they are NOT  dingy looking or anything like that."
3.0,I liked the look on line and on my closet hanger but when I tried it on I was disappointed. The softness of the fabric<br />did not fall well over my belly. It did not drape as well as the photos show. The models are super thin and tall.
3.0,"Like this color assortment for the men, would love it if were  in women, nice fall colors.  Price great! Thanks"
3.0,"Thanks very nice,  Like others my shirt is ripping as-well"
3.0,"I love the Magnesium wash, which is a medium/light color denim great for day time. The denim is soft and lightweight, which is good and bad. Good thing is they are very comfy, the bad thing is that the fabric has a lot more give and stretches more easily than the Revolution wash. I would probably purchase 1 size down."
3.0,Bought this for my birthday outfit but it’s cheap sadly ! I will use it for a Halloween costume though so not a total loss .
3.0,"I like but I'm still going to look for the full size swim goggles, they're just more comfortable to me."
3.0,Everything was fine with the disguise. It looks very flexible but it has a sewing at the back that did not hold one bend over.
3.0,"spaces are a little small, zipper compartment is small.  Overall good size nice material"
3.0,I would give it a 3 and 1/2 stars. They're super cute! But you get what you pay for. I wore on this weekend and I had to fix it twice because the clasp would break off.
3.0,My daughter loved these until the knee pad started bunching up. They didn't last a whole season.
3.0,"Loved the product, but the waistband is extremely tight. I felt I could not breathe in it. If a waistband would be wider, the item would fit better as the compression would be more evenly distributed."
3.0,"The item is WAY too small to be considered a one size fits all item.  I typically wear an XL or 14 top.  5'8&#34;.  I am muscular, but the armholes are WAY too tight!  This item would not be comfortable on anyone with bigger than puny arms.  The pockets look like they are placed properly in the picture, which might be the case if you were an XS petite person. on me these are weirdly place right under my chest.  3 stars because it does actually lay nicely if I ignore the squeeze on my arms.  Still debating whether or not to open the seams in the armholes a bit, or not bother and just return it.  The color and material is as expected for the price.  Not high quality. But not flimsy cheap either, if the armholes weren't so tight and the pockets weren't in a weird place this would be a 4."
3.0,"Nice quick wallet, but not effective in RFID blocking. I put my work badge in this wallet as well and the badge reader could still read the badge."
3.0,Colors are NOT as vibrant as the picture makes it seem. Nice ring though.
3.0,Had to get a 3X-large to fit a size 14.
3.0,The colors were beautiful and vibrant. I don't mind if things are a little loose but I was drowning in this dress and had to return it. I am 5'4 and 120 lbs. I wish there were different sizes to choose from. This was a nice galaxy dress if you are a bigger size.
3.0,"I love the way the watch looks, but the cuff part is very loose and it keeps falling off . There is no way to tighten or secure it."
3.0,This is a nice shirt but it says it’s short sleeve but it came long sleeved.
3.0,"my daughter loves these boots and wears them EVERY day!  She wears them to school, to the park, on the weekend, etc...everywhere.  Her feet don't get smelly like they do in sneakers sometimes.  5 stars from her.  3 stars from me because after a month, the glitter is peeling of the foot part and they have holes in them.  She was very rough on them, but I was hoping to get more than a month out of them.  I've been looking for some pretty pink leather boots that will hold up better and of course nothing comes close to the sparkle on these!  The pictures are after 2 months of daily wear."
3.0,Beautiful piece for the price but if you have small wrists this will be difficult to keep on.
3.0,"They gave me 2 of them, the colorful ones. I'm using them for my nose"
3.0,"Cute shorts, but the waist was too small even after sizing up from a medium to a large. Had to send them back."
3.0,Product is  &#34;okay&#34; but not sized to American standards so please order the next size up.
3.0,"Great gift although the chain sucks and charm is really small but, was a great gift after buying a thicker chain"
3.0,Stone doesn’t stay on base
3.0,Its just what my son wanted. Its exactly what the description says it is. Having the option to change color of watch band is a nice touch.
3.0,My grandson wouldn't wear these due to sensory issues and being able to feel the grippers through the sock
3.0,Waaaaaay small....fit my daughter who is a size 6
3.0,"Fit everywhere but the waist, so I'm exchanging for larger size"
3.0,Cute but length runs short
3.0,"I pretty much wear medium in everything. The large was even too small for me.<br />Had to return them, I needed two sizes larger than I normally wear."
3.0,"Easy to install, hard to out on as it's really stiff.  It's not glittery, which is fine cause I didn't really want that anyway.  Sorta discolored."
3.0,Just as describe fits a little loose
3.0,"Smaller then was expected, also I’ve only worn once and the tardis is already starting to peel off"
3.0,muy bonito set pero se ve a través de la tela
3.0,One leg was tighter than the other. All three fit differently. Two out of three pairs aren't bad.I bought a size medium
3.0,Decent gym hoodie. A bit snug. Quality is on the cheaper side of the scale.
3.0,"Quality is amazing! Incredibly soft cotton, and premium stitching. The personalized tag is also a bonus. The fit, though, was just awkward. The sleeves were about 5 inches too short, along with the length of the entire shirt. I guess my tip would be to do the fit image video scan thing with a looser fitting top. And for Amazon to add sleeve length, and fit preference options (like wanting a looser fit)."
3.0,"This top seems confortable but it doesn't cover much of my stomach. Picture is deceiving. Were not all 16 and want to flaunt it, and seems cheaply made. It it were a brand name I'd sweR it was a knock-off."
3.0,"I'm on the fence with this one...  The top fits perfect-true to size.  I am 5'10 and it is long enough to the ankle.  The only problem is the waist/ belly area/ backside is very clingy.  So unless you are lucky enough to have a flat stomach and don't need shape-wear then this dress would be great for you.  For those others of us who aren't so lucky, you would probably need to wear shape-wear if you purchased your normal size.  (Unfortunately, I despise wearing shape-wear!)"
3.0,"These are thin and comfortable...better than nothing, BUT because they are so thin they probably aren’t doing much either to protect the other person or you! Too bad they don’t have a slot to slide in a filter."
3.0,I give it 3 stars because the item looked like it was used. The package came open. You could clearly see it was tired on and top was stretch out. The ruffles on the skirt was all messed up.  On a brighter note I bought the exact item from the same company from Walmart and the sizing was spot on. Its a beautiful item otherwise
3.0,I was not pleased with this dress when it arrived and I tried it on. The neck portion is poorly made. I am returning this dress.
3.0,"Really like the simple packaging ( lunch bag for undies).  These are quite relaxed fit and more of boxer than a brief. Not much support in these unless you hike them up. They are comfortable, just a little too long and loose."
3.0,"Thia dress is cheaply made, as you could guess by the price. The length was perfect for me at 5' 6"". I wore flats and it dragged on the ground a bit. If I wore 1-2"" heels, it would have been perfect. The top was awkward. I have a DDD chest, so I could easily fill it, however, it kept slipping down and people could see my bra on the sides. I ended up sewing the straps smaller and that helped a bit. Still an awkward fit though. I just wore a cardigan to cover it up!"
3.0,These are ok. I only wear the Aztec looking one of them though. The rest are goofishly too big.
3.0,"These run extremely small, not comically so, but the large I ordered should be considered on the small side of medium."
3.0,"The size is smaller than I anticipated, should have ordered one size larger than what I usually order<br />The shirt is ok but not more"
3.0,Price is great. A little hard to put on most of my sunglasses. Would have liked them to be longer. I have stretched to the longest which still isn’t very long. A guy could never wear these.
3.0,very large under arm holes that are not to my liking.  feels a little cheap.
3.0,This worked to some extent - I have a big booty and this kept sliding up on me. You definitely cannot wear this under a sleeveless outfit. The stays in the back have white lettering of their logo - shows through. However it did cinch my waist and lift the girls.
3.0,"I like the dress it’s very soft, it covers your entire bust area so your bra does not show. The length is perfect, my height is 5’7 , I’m very curvy in the hips area. My size in jeans and shirts is a size 14 (L) but if you don’t want the dress to be too tight get the 2xL if you like even looser 3xl it’s elastic around the waist area so it will fit to your size☺️"
3.0,Loved the dress but claustrophobically tight across chest & sleeves. Not sized right.
3.0,Tail is about one third the size of shown in picture...super short.
3.0,you get what you pay for. I will buy again just to save a few dollars on clothes.I guess I'm cheap...
3.0,So the owners manual doesn’t say the part where I had to throw it against the wall in anger for it to start working....
3.0,Fits to tightly around neck.
3.0,For as much as I paid for these they should be a lot better than they are.
3.0,Nice cute hat but the speaker keeps falling out of the cuff. 🙄
3.0,"It’s great looking but it gets hot and foggy, but then, it’s the summer in texas, I guess is logical"
3.0,They are fine and cheap but not comfortable.
3.0,They are not compression tanks they fit like regular tanks.
3.0,This is a really cute shirt however it is to small in the bust!
3.0,This vest was very large and long.  It seemed comfortable though.  I sent it back since it was too big for me.
3.0,It was for a date. Simple and nice. Soft too
3.0,Cheap fabric made of low quality stretchy material that shines when stretched
3.0,The color was more pink than purple.
3.0,its ok....but to small.
3.0,"Its really a very nice wallet-purse....however the length is too short... Years ago I had a wallet-purse and loved loved loved it... and its been hard to replace....it was a wallet and a purse combined... it had very similar features as yours which was why i was so excited about getting it...but its maybe 2 inches shorter in length which makes a big difference for money, and number of items it will hold.... however the features are great..."
3.0,"I love the size and style of these, but the stones in the two earrings aren't a perfect match. One is more clear and the other a bit more opaque. Probably not noticeable when you are wearing them, but it is definitely noticeable when they are side by side."
3.0,"It's okay. You get what you paid for - mediocre quality. The fabric on the skirt part is too stiff/rough for me. Also, good luck on hiding the wrinkles for colors other than black. I would probably wear this couple times a year at the very most."
3.0,This is not a push up and it does not have an underwire.  I will have to wear a strapless bra under this bathing suit however it is a cute bathing suit.
3.0,Keyhole is a little lower cut than expected.
3.0,The fit and style of the shirt is good. It just seems like the iron on image was not carefully done and will likely come off. I will not put in the dryer. I am a new poodle owner and will keep the shirt.
3.0,I choose a small size so it's difficult to apreciate how beautifull is.
3.0,"I wanted to like this because my posture has always been poor. I bought both this one and the men's version and this one is by far the more comfortable of the two. I am 6'2"" and 205 pounds. The two major issues for me were 1. It didn't have enough support in the shoulders to make it uncomfortable for me to slouch. 2. The zipper makes this shirt a bit bulky and you'll need to wear a thicker shirt to conceal it"
3.0,Has already started coming apart
3.0,"Very cute dress. From a distance it's really nice. However up close the dress lacks quality. Several loose threads were coming out of both the embroidery and the seams. The material, including the lining are pretty scratchy.<br />I will be returning this dress because it is too snug in the arms/chest for me. I have a large rib cage and broad shoulders. The material does not have any give so it was too tight for me to wear comfortably. If you are also broad in your top half I would recommend sizing up. It fit me well in hips and waist- very flattering in this area."
3.0,for those who want it to fit well should buy one size less
3.0,Just too small and tight around my chest.
3.0,Small frame
3.0,"Not at all like the color in the picture. Way too fluorescent! Otherwise, a good product."
3.0,I did not like the fabric type. It was sort of shiny and thin. I know other people really enjoy this product so maybe its just a preference I have when it comes to leggings.<br />Otherwise the fit was okay. I ordered a small. I usually wear a size 4. Im 5'2 and it was very long on me.
3.0,"I Loooooooooved this cuff earring, when I wore it (ONCE) I had so many compliments, but the pain I was in just was not worth it. The clasp for the upper part of the ear is just too strong, or tight. I'm thinking of taking it somewhere where they can loosen up the thing. It is incredibly painful, I even had a small cushioned pad because I knew it would start bothering me after a few hours but my ear got so red I ended up having to take it off. Be ware of the clasp, otherwise great piece."
3.0,They are pretty but just wasn't my cup of tea. For the price they are good. There are flimsy. I ended up giving my daughter to play dress up in. So it wasn't a big loss.
3.0,I love the design but it is truly for someone with a smaller wrist. It would be great if it came in different sizes. I have big wrists for a woman but a man’s wrist would be the same size.
3.0,One pair was broken when they arrived but it needed a pair right away so I kept them.
3.0,Shirt was perfect but the shorts were to large
3.0,"Partly, my fault because I was in a bit of a hurry to pack a hospital bag to deliver. Searched for High-waisted undies with a good customer reviews.  Saw the picture and high star rating, threw them in my cart and ordered.  Only got 4 undies and 2 are nude and white which is not idea for after having a baby. Just be aware there are better deals with a full pack at better prices."
3.0,The look is ok. The fabric is ok. The sizing is HORRIBLE!  Amazon you really have to do a better job of providing sizing when sourcing from Asian vendors. Asians are half our size in height and 1/3 our size in weight/stature.  I will never buy again if it's not clear who the seller is (China/Japan... wherever).  The model in the pix must be well under 5'0&#34; and under 110lbs. She could be taller but definitely not above 110lbs.  I'm not sending it back because it was cheap... but if it's coming from China/Japan any of those countries... I won't be ordering.
3.0,"Free colorful headband came with pants, pants flare at bottom and waistband design is super cute. However, the material is extremely thin - you know, the kind of material that will show every wrinkle and dimple. I would not recommend this product unless you are smooth and toned!"
3.0,Size is smaller than what I usually wear
3.0,"it just doesn't sit right. the zippered are hard to to do. if i saw it in a store, i would not have bought it."
3.0,The material was to thin.......  It wasn't what was expected..
3.0,The fabric was heavy. It fits OK but shows body flaws very stretchy.Ad to long for my 5 ft. No
3.0,"The photo looks a lot snazzier than the product. Major pro is that it folds up small enough to stick in your back pocket, if you want a hat that folds up small enough to fit in your back pocket."
3.0,Just what I wanted to make my little black dress look classic
3.0,"Could be cute, but the tie is strange and doesn't &#34;cinch&#34; your waist at all...."
3.0,Not meant for thicker necks
3.0,the film doesn’t roll back in on its own.
3.0,It's pretty. I haven't wore it yet but tried it on and it's super short.  Need some Carrie Underwood legs for this dress.
3.0,"The fit and size was nice, but I wear a pantyliner every day, and they would not stick to these underwear AT ALL. It would just slide around while I walked and get all scrunched up and stuck to itself. I really wanted to like them but they’re just not going to work for me."
3.0,I still use them and it’s been over a year! I don’t like that they are less flexible! But good transition if I have to jump outside for a quick need!
3.0,"The colors are bright and pretty but be advised that these are very large.  If you have a small face or even a regular size face it will NOT fit properly.  I had to return mine.  Had the size worked I would have kept it, unfortunately it was just too large."
3.0,I'll wear it but it looks better on my 4 yr old. I have a small head.
3.0,"I use to wear a 3XL ( weighed in at 280 lbs) but now down to an XL. The description was they run small so I ordered a 4XL , they fit perfectly. They are definitely not sized correctly."
3.0,"The two pieces were featured together, but the watch is BRONZE, & the other set is SILVER. I wanted to make matching earrings out of the other pieces, but they don't match. Why would they feature them together?"
3.0,Guess I have a small head. But will still wear it.
3.0,Too big. I ordered my child's size thinking it would be perfect but it was too large even in the arms
3.0,It’s really cute! But it is not a dress. It’s a shirt. It would need an extra button to be a dress.
3.0,I'm not usually a wide shoe person but I wish I ordered a wide in these. After a few days I noticed the treads on the bottom starting to come off.
3.0,Need to order 2 sizes up.fits very close to the body
3.0,"The black stripes are more of a dark green color, its an okay band but Im a little let down."
3.0,"I know you don’t always get what is expected in an item, & I don’t write reviews a lot, I’m a very easy going person. So here is my thoughts just in case you’re thinking of buying: 1) the thickness is fine, a little thicker than I expected, 2) too large for my face, but I’m ok with it. I usually buy small or kids, so I knew I was taking a risk. 3) what I’m not keen on is that although people will get the idea, it’s supposed to say ew... people, instead it says ew... eople with a very partial loop of a p at the beginning of people. I spent 10, it’s not a lot of money, but I don’t always have extra to spend. Anywho😆😉, merry & safe holidays to all!"
3.0,The XXL size  is more like a large.
3.0,"These are very comfortable but they SHED everywhere. My house and bedroom especially are covered in purple and pink fluff. Got them to wear after surgery & I can't bend down to pick up the blobs of fluff everywhere, so it's been driving me nuts"
3.0,"It was super cute and just as listed but it didn’t make me look the best in the stomach area. Really wish it would have worked out as I was planning to wear to Vegas. I’m 5’1, 145 lbs and ordered a medium."
3.0,These are nice shorts and fit well. Buy up at least 1 size for a more comfortable fit. My only reservation is that I do not think these are full 100% cotton as they do not breathe as well as some other shorts I have that are 100%. I am a 32&#34; waist and ordered both the large (light gray) and the medium (dark gray). I have included pictures to show the difference in fit. Both are the same shorts but one does not have the logo on the outside.
3.0,"I was disappointed, only because I misread the info on these earrings.  I thought they would be smaller, also the color was greener than I expected.  I returned them."
3.0,However there are a few stains on the dress & some of the pocket stitching isn’t good<br /><br />This was sent to my elderly mum until I can see her I can’t assess if the stains will come out<br /><br />Such a shame for a pretty dress
3.0,"I  choose black color, it is nice for summertime , good  Quality  , fit size, but i am disappointed that i paid $30 for my dress come in  a white plastic bag !!  There is no box there is no cover ."
3.0,"This is a decent and affordable belt, but it doesn’t last very long. After about a year of use the leather starts to crack. It’s still usable, but it looks tacky."
3.0,I would say buy one size smaller.
3.0,Very soft material but not compressive enough. Cross between leggings and flannel pj.  Also pocket seams inside were bulky and uncomfortable.
3.0,I love the style and feel of this product but it not transitions. Coming out of the box they were barely tinted as they should be. But even after spending hours in the sun they never change. Due to the lack of shading they are not very functional for outdoor activities.
3.0,Soft beanie.  But the color is more pink/red than plum (which I assumed meant more purplish).
3.0,"Nice stitching. Too much Stay fresh, and smaller than size says."
3.0,I had to return it. it runs at least a size smaller
3.0,"The turtleneck fits well, however, it is not the beautiful blue shown in the picture.  It is dark teal green.  Very disappointed but I decided to keep the teal green turtleneck.<br /><br />AMAZON, please change the picture with the correct color of the top!"
3.0,Beautiful color but style looks different from<br />One model wearing.
3.0,"Kind of cheap, but my mom seemed to like it still."
3.0,"I bought this for someone as a collectible. He's a Sigma and loves watches so it was the perfect gift. It would have been nice if it came with a box, but since he's a collector of watches he had something to store it in. I'd buy it again."
3.0,Didn’t like the collar
3.0,These were cute but I couldn't find a way to remove the pads and they kept getting folded and moving inside the bra so I wouldn't suggest this item
3.0,"Feels ok.  Pretty absorbent, kind of like a towel version of a snuggly."
3.0,ABOUT 2 SIZES OFF. ORDER XL IF YOU WEAR MEDIUM. NICE QUALITY THOUGH
3.0,"works fine and was great, until i tried to swap the band out and then the hole the pin goes in broke, so now it's just a working face and no strap.  so that's annoying."
3.0,Beautiful dress but it didn't fit. Wish they had a bigger size. :( so sad it didn't fit.
3.0,"The fabric is nice, but the fit is off. The top of this dress was really tight, but the rest fit fine.  I saw this mentioned in other reviews, so I did size up. I wasn't sure if another size up would have made much of a difference, so I returned it."
3.0,"I purchased this on Sept 10, 2020 and loved it. Unfortunately on June 29 the pin that holds the key fob to the ring broke and it all fell apart. Other than only getting almost 10 months of use out of this, it was great."
3.0,Well  I was expecting a RED bag based on the photos but it was a HOT PINK. In addition I thought the cooler part was detachable bec of the way it was depicted in the photos.  Its actually not.  The insulation is a bit thin not as thick as my other cooler bag but I guess it'll have to work.  All in all not a bad bag for less than five bux. Join kreative kodes on FB for other great deals.
3.0,"I loved how this dress fit me so much that this is actually my second one. However, the material tears easily. You MUST hang to dry and wash delicate. Even simply wearing it can lend to tearing (at seams and other locations). I definitely won't be buying any more and will continue to mend the ones I have. Would I recommend? Meh. If you don't mind the sewing then yes."
3.0,It was ok for being cheap
3.0,Very bery short!!!!!! Like a crop top really? Ughh
3.0,"I really liked this watch when I got it. I have a very small wrist and to find a band that is small enough for me can be very difficult. I was happy when I got it and found that it fit perfectly. There is a catch tho, after a little were the band (the part i was so wanting) broke. It turns out that the band is glued to its self to make the loop for the pin, NOT stitched. How hard would it have been to put a couple stitches in that spot. Now I cant use it because I again can not find a band that fits ME!"
3.0,Took forever to get the shipment since they come from China.  Just ok quality.  These actually look like you're wearing Pepe Le Pew on your feet.
3.0,"I bought these to cinch up long t-shirts, and while they work ok, they’re small so your t-shirt can’t be very thick. I’d say they’re better to use with a scarf."
3.0,I ordered a 2x. It fits more like a medium. I only ordered this so if we have a rainy day during ren fest I will have something to cover with. Hopefully I won’t have to wear it since I won’t even be able to fix my hair because the neck hole is so small it will mess it up. It is also much shorter the the image makes it out to be. At least I don’t need it to be long. The length hits me about my bum.
3.0,This item is not that great as it cannot be made longer for a man.
3.0,"Loved that it was a Hamilton inspired.<br />Not exactly high quality. A Christmas present for a 12 year old, but not good quality for anyone much older. More like a trinket."
3.0,Strange material. Very heavy weighted and doesn’t breathe at all. Looks great but not comfortable
3.0,"Very classy, but the links would come undone sometimes."
3.0,"****UPDATE****<br />In my initial review(below) I had given these high marks and five stars.  Today, upon trying on my second pair (in black) I downgraded these due to lack of consistency.<br /><br />I initially got the faux snake style.  Different color but same shoe.  However, the black ones are not nearly as great. The sole feels like a regular shoe not anywhere as soft cushy and comfy as the first ones I bought just a week ago.  Disappointed.<br /><br />**********************<br /><br />I am still in awe of how these work.<br /><br />I feel like I just bought magic shoes!<br /><br />I have not been able to walk like a normal human for months now...I reluctantly ordered these sandals.<br /><br />After having spent a small fortune on a sleep boot, plantar fasciitis socks, foot insoles, cold packs, cold socks, warm socks, special running shoes, etc nothing even touched the pain.  Zero relief with all those things I bought before.<br /><br />These shoes.  Magic."
3.0,The eyes are a little off and the purple stones are underwhelming.
3.0,The backs of the gauges are really long. This causes the gauges to slip around and fall out. Also the fronts of the gauges (decorative part) is really loose and feels as if it can easily break off.
3.0,"They're nice not too blingy, and flashy great size tho."
3.0,"A near miss. The picture clearly shows two leaves of a similar size, however I received a pair of mismatched sized leaves. One leaf is significantly smaller than the other (at least a centimeter). They’re beautiful but unless you’re going for the Mona Lisa lopsided look, they’re not right."
3.0,They are very nice but I thought 300 strength would be stronger.
3.0,Maybe a bit too snug.
3.0,It arrived on time and in good condition. The instructions for use were primarily limited to initial setup use. Unfastening the buckle required going to the internet to find videos on its ongoing use. The buckle is the main issue. It's rather bulky. Unlike some other (more expensive) variations of this kind of belt. But the price is low and the material quality appears to be good. I've bought a second of these in a different belt color so you can say I'm sufficiently satisfied with the price/quality/functionality trade-offs.
3.0,The quality of the fabric has gone down over the years of these underwear
3.0,"It's ok.  The fabric is rather thin, so it somewhat clings to the body.  I can't say this would keep me warm.  I do think it's super cute for spring.  The colors look great!  Do order a size up from what you normally wear."
3.0,One set was ok and one set was too small
3.0,"Way too small. I ordered large and got small, although the package said large. I gave them to my neice who has small feet she has made<br />good use of them. You just never know what your going to get from China. The cost to send it back is more than the product is worth. I sometimes<br />think they know that, and don't feel as if they have to be accurate about what they send you for that reason. I would not order again."
3.0,Very cute fur the price...nice material
3.0,Saw these earrings on so many YouTube videos and they really are as cute as they say. Sadly I have to return because they are too big on my small face.
3.0,"Runs a little slim, and light weight."
3.0,"FIts large and is super long, I'd buy a size smaller."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress and if it would have fit I would have bumped it up one star. I ordered a medium and the manufacturers must think it should fit women who are over 6 feet tall. I am 5'4, tried on the dress with 4 inch heels, and this dress was still over 3 inches too long. I returned it :("
3.0,This would have been a nice ring if only it had a thicker band... smh...
3.0,Beautiful jacket yet wrong measurements for a 2XL These jackets aren't made for most Grown Men!!!
3.0,"I had to replace an OGIO locker bag that I had completely worn out.  I looked at this and read some reviews and gave it a shot.  The pros: very convenient to carry, like the three compartments as opposed to the two with OGIO, lots of pockets for stuff.  The cons:  the bag does not stay upright, keeps collapsing on itself, the shoe compartment has a pocket for a piece of plywood to make the shelf study, but the tongue of my shoes catches every time I try to pull them out, several of the pockets are not accessible when the bag is in the locker, so I have to take it out to get to things."
3.0,This bag is NOT authentic Micheal Kors!
3.0,I like it picture but the
3.0,Never got the look as the picture.
3.0,It's a cute dress but the top light pink part is on the thinner side. You could see my beige bra pretty easily. Returned for that reason.
3.0,I got an XL and it was way too tight. So I took it back and got an XXL. It was so baggy I could for 5 of my arms in each sleeve. I wear size large tops. Sometimes medium.
3.0,"So I saw the other people complaining about size and I thought to myself &#34;Well a medium is 32-34 and I'm on the lower end of that and I prefer a tighter fit anyway so I'll just get a medium&#34;<br /><br />Let's just say if you're a guy you gotta look out for your little guy down there and make sure he has some room. Take a size up or else your little guy will be uncomfortable.<br /><br />Heaven forbid your little guy gets excited while wearing these, because then stuff really gets tight."
3.0,"I chose this rating because someone else wears them, and I don't actually know.  He said they make things a lot clearer."
3.0,Was so so. Was not good material invested in these purses. The price should of been half.
3.0,Not Americans sizes. My size is a 2xl so I ordered a 6xl it didn’t fit. I have a athletic build big shoulders.
3.0,Cute material. Child's apron is MUCH smaller than is pictured. These are supposed to be gifts so I am not sure I will keep them I may return them because of this.
3.0,Flimsier than I thought.
3.0,"Ive got another belt just like it so this is probably the same thing. Didn’t realize that I’d be paying for shipping. I was pretty sure they gave me the wrong size, its usable but a little to big."
3.0,"It was fine until it broke off, I also thought it'd be smaller"
3.0,"This is definitely not made for intense sports or any sports. The heavy cotton material does not allow for breathability. Thin nylon material would be best suited. Otherwise, the fit and look is nice"
3.0,the material was kinda rough and after first wash already stared to form little balls
3.0,"Chain fell off the first time I tried to put it on. I fixed it with pliers. It's alright. For $3 I can't complain. Took a few weeks to arrive, which is standard from China."
3.0,"It was fine, but the interfacing was not sewn down and would not lay flat😠"
3.0,They are descent leggings. They are nice material. Not see through but a tad thin and very soft. The only problem is they roll down on top a bit and they gap slightly in the crotch area. I only bought them to wear around the house for those lazy days. To be honest I think they are a bit pricey for how they are. I wouldn’t purchase again because I’ve found better ones for cheaper
3.0,Wish I could have exchanged it without paying shipping twice it was a gift and I was on a budget.  I was forced to pay more than I wanted due to paying shipping twice :(
3.0,"This is a really cute apron. It was a little thiner than expected and for that reason i gave it 3 stars. I don't think its &#34;commercial&#34; grade at all like stated, but great for occasional home use. I love the little dogs and the pockets are nice. Being water proof is a nice bonus too!"
3.0,"In Texas these shoes were a hot item for Christmas this year. The lights are great, offering several settings and color selections, they get the kids excited, and they're  easy to charge. However, the quality and comfort of the shoes are not great. A close look will show glue marks,  they don't offer much support, and the shoelaces untie very easily."
3.0,Good jacket. Said men’s but turned out to be a women’s jacket. Zipper on wrong side for men.
3.0,I loved the picture and that is why I bought. In reality the product is silver. The black in the dress doesn’t show. It’’s just not like the picture. Deceiving should change the picture.
3.0,It’s great but it’s clasped with a Magnet and comes loose here and there but it’s good.
3.0,"I got the gray color and it's super soft and pretty but it's not as thick as the one the model is wearing.  It's missing the fluffiness that is evident in the photos.  It does creep up my head, too.  Other than that, for the price it's okay."
3.0,"This dress is very pretty but the fabric is different. It was slightly large. The zipper broke just trying it on, before I got to wear it anywhere. I am frustrated but I paid for the repair myself because I had no time to send it back. The white belt is not fashionable. I purchased a wide black belt to pare with this dress and it works much better."
3.0,I was so happy birthday to arrive even with adjusting it does not fit an adult
3.0,"I like the colors, but dislike that there was no light. Also, based on the pic, I thought the band was stretchy type.  I may have missed something though . I was looking for simple use for my 83 year old Father"
3.0,"Purchased for my wife, she likes the watch a lot. It is built well and looks nice."
3.0,"Maybe I should have sized down, but they seem a little baggy in the wrong places.  They’re fine to wear around the house, but I won’t wear them out."
3.0,Nice skirt. A bit small..
3.0,chain looks cheap
3.0,"Very shiny, cheap looking gold."
3.0,"It’s not very soft and made me feel big, but it’s a pretty color."
3.0,"They are extremely comfortable and breathable, only issues I have are I bought an extra small (I’m petite and short) thinking it wouldn’t be so long, but they do go way passed my butt, which makes the pockets pretty far down. 😢 so if they have extra small I would suggest getting that"
3.0,"Review per wife. Nice quality skirt, sized as expected, but not a good fit on me, I looked like a frumpy butterball."
3.0,"Although the sweater is pretty, it’s very thin and see through. Works with a tank top under just fine, but didn’t work for me"
3.0,The beads are muted and very pretty. The bracelet is light and fits perfectly on my small wrist. The cording is very thin and does not appear to be ready for extended use. I used button thread and embroidery floss to rework the ends so I no longer have to worry. I will keep the bracelet but it definitely needs a stronger cording.
3.0,Bought a size up hoping for more modest length but still above the knees. Strange for where the waistline is but paired with something underneath will be doable. Overall ok.
3.0,"I had ordered one before in size small (im 5*2 122lbs) and it fit well..Tight enough but not excruciatingly tiny. However, i ordered another one in the same size and this one slips down and doesnt really tighten. I did notice that the size was wasn't labeled."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive these earrings because I have been looking for a pretty green/emerald color for a while. Based on the picture, I thought I had found them, but I have to say I am very disappointed. THEY ARE NOT GREEN AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE! At first, I thought maybe I was just sent the wrong color because they look like a blackish blue. It's only when you put them in a brighter light and rotate them at different angles that you can see green and, even then, it's difficult. I put them on, and they are still pretty when they catch the light, so I'll keep them. I will say that the picture provided by the company is very deceptive and needs to be changed to provide a more accurate representation of the true color of these earrings for potential buyers. Even though the earrings are pretty, I would not recommend these to a friend because they are falsely represented. Also, if you are looking to purchase these earrings, I think it is important to realize that the star rating you see for the product includes two other products, a pair of blue earrings and a necklace. So, the 4 1/2 star rating is NOT just for the &#34;dark green&#34; earrings. Again, very deceptive."
3.0,I gave ita one star previously. But now I give it a three. I absolutely love the product. I hope it lasts a while. I also gave it three stars because it arrived two weeks later that it original arrival time.
3.0,Good product but using it with the original strap difficult to put the pin.
3.0,Looks like good quality but their sizing is too small.
3.0,Looks great but the gold came chipped off already near the screw area... I'm afraid the coat will keep peeling back and will eventually get lodged in my skin if I wear it long enough. Seems hazardous ..
3.0,It’s good but really have material
3.0,Mask is way too big to fit a small child of 7 but the costume fit great
3.0,Not sure why the people who make this feel the need to photo shop their advertisement pictures as it works perfectly well<br /><br />They are merely inviting people who purchase the product to feel aggrieved because they don't look as the picture depicts it
3.0,"I ordered a size up and the fit was perfect.  The problem is the bottom.  It becomes a little see through when it gets wet.  So if you’re only going to sit by the pool, no problem.  Just don’t get the suit wet unless you’re alone in your own backyard pool."
3.0,Good quality and looks great. But for was too small.
3.0,wasn't believable to me ....
3.0,"Had this bag for a year. Worked well for carrying around a good amount of stuff. However, the stitching near the bottom of the shoulder strap tore and there's a hole in the side of the bag. The other side is coming undone as well. I've had regular school backpacks that have lasted longer than this. Aside from that, it's a good overall bag, but that stitching really needs to be reinforced at that particular part of the bag."
3.0,Cute top but it's a little big or the straps may be flimsy. Seems like I'm always pulling it up. Otherwise very cute & material is not bad.
3.0,The watch is large for a 13 year old but he likes it. The lamination (back light) is very dim. You get what you pay for.
3.0,they are not over-sized.
3.0,"Pants are as pictured, comfortable & a good price. However upon washing and drying they’re more of a cropped jogger than full length."
3.0,Love the shirt nice material but its way to tight in the arms area gotta send it back😫😫😫
3.0,"Product arrived on time. Runs small. I bought this for myself on the off chance that I might be able to fit into it. However, if you have hips, this is going to be a really tight squeeze or in my case no squeeze at all. I ended up giving it to my 11 year old as it didn't fit the 13 year old either. However, that said, its a really cute skirt. The construction was what I would expect for 7 dollar skirt. I didn't see any loose threads, but there were a few spots where the sewing was uneven (not the skirt-just the sewing lines). The color is very similar to the screen picture. Mine might be slightly more orangey than peach, but close enough that I wouldn't worry about it. It does have an inner lining panel that is shorter than the outer lining panel (which is chiffon and see through). So I think it would be a good idea to wear shorts under it. The length is also a bit on the shorter side. On my 13 year old who is 5'4&#34; it ended in mini skirt territory. Another reason to wear shorts under it. All in all I would say its a cute mini skirt that runs very small and for those of us graced with smaller hips."
3.0,"Very long, cheep thin straps that curl up."
3.0,"If you want a simple leather belt then this is the one for you, however, I was disappointed with this belt. It looks more black than the brown leather I was expecting and it almost didn't fit in the belt loops because it is too wide. Also there really isn't any discoloration like most leather belts are. It fit a little bit smaller than the size suggested which I understand because that is what happens with belts but it just doesn't look good. I guess this is just one that is used strictly to keep the pants up. It came in a nice little bag and I love the smell of the leather but when the package it comes in is nicer than the product inside that is a problem for me. I hope this review helps in your choice to purchase."
3.0,The color get change I bought red but  now it is fade not that much happy.
3.0,"Cute, but too thin to be effective, and really big--i have to fold it in half."
3.0,"it works how it says, but the neck part is very short and i had to add to it to cover it and the nose on the mask doesnt stay up and its annoying to constantly adjust it."
3.0,"This is decent bc it did what I wanted it to do- I needed an Anna dress to match my daughters Elsa dress. We do family pictures every year and for my daughter's birthday she wanted us to dress like Elsa and Anna. It is very hard to find an Anna dress. The dress took a while to get there, and the fit is very odd. I'm a C cup and the chest was still kinda baggy and odd looking and the waist digs in and is very uncomfortable the way it's sewn together. You almost have to wear something under it so it doesn't rub to much. I hate leaving bad reviews but for the price I paid I just wasn't crazy about it. I knew from reading other reviews what to expect with the material but it was still just not all that flattering at all. I love that it did what it was intended to and that I'll probably get some use out of it at Halloween but I in all honesty I still kind of regret buying this."
3.0,"I am 150lb with 29” waist and 42” hip, I ordered the medium and it was too small so I’d size up."
3.0,"When I tighten mine, it keeps loosening. Decent for the price."
3.0,The glasses were missing from the order. The jacket meets expectations and fits as expected. Just disappointed it was not complete.
3.0,Beautiful color and style but not flattering on me. Also ran much larger than expected so I’m returning.  Quick delivery wish it fit.
3.0,"They were too small for me width wise, but also too long length wise. So I gave them to a tall, skinny friend who is enjoying them."
3.0,"Take my review with a grain of salt as I did purchase these to be a costume piece and not a day to day garment! I’m 5’2” and usually a 14 but when I saw a review saying these were Chinese sizes I unhesitatingly bought the XXXL knowing I could make them smaller if I needed. They actually fit well, although a bit low rise for my taste generally. I like the fabric, it seems like a nice fake suede. They are stretchy and comfortable. The laces are real suede but are kind of terrible lengths, the ones meant for the thighs are much too short for my thick thighs and the ones for the calves seem a bit long. I might Frankenstein them together or just replace them with something contrasting. Also immediately after trying them on I noticed the stitching coming loose in the crotch. I’ll sew it up but it’s kind of annoying. They’re definitely cute for a funky accent but aren’t going to last daily use.<br />Excuse my sunburned feet and dirty mirror."
3.0,"A little smaller than expected, and the lace part is very itchy.  Other than that, very nice nightgown and robe for the price."
3.0,"It’s an attractive price and I suppose it’s fair for what it is—flattering yet cheaply made. Don’t expect this dress to last long; your washer might eat it. I tried it on the minute it arrived and was sort of horrified to find that it didn’t fit me in the bust! I’ve always been Sml—Med (size 6 usually in most brands) but I ordered a Med since I’m pregnant. But I t didn’t even button up around my rib cage! Now I am 3 month pregnant already, so I hardly expect to stay a size 6 HENCE ordering the Medium. My weight hasn’t fluctuated that much, and my ribs certainly haven’t expanded!<br />My advice is size up and don’t expect quality material. It is a cute dress, though, for which I granted 3 stars. Took of a star for quality and deducted a star for inaccurate sizing."
3.0,"It's cute, just like the picture. Unfortunately, if you have chubby fingers it won't fit you. It's meant for skinny finger. The ring fits me on my ring and pinky fingers"
3.0,I love the pattern. Not quite as happy with how fast one of the spokes gave way.
3.0,Decent. Broke first day i wore them.
3.0,The top is huge and no way to adjust.  I am 36c and doesn’t work for me
3.0,It is nice just have to reinforce it to make it last
3.0,Aún no lo hemos probado en nieve y lluvia
3.0,The cup size fits perfectly the straps are thin and bit into shoulders....very uncomfortable.
3.0,Happy with suspenders but only used twice so far
3.0,Thought this was a dark denim but it's actually a velet material.  Cute but not as described.
3.0,"6'0"", 195lb athletic build and the medium fit well.  The material and buttons are nice.<br /><br />Overall, it looks good, but the stand collar meant to keep the collar from drooping lies flat as if it is buttoned.  So it doesn't stand up and out like in the picture.  Whether you have all the buttons undone or the top 1-2 undone, the collar lies flat on your chest.  I will probably have to get an iron or something to reshape the collar a bit and see if I can get the stand collar to sit differently -- it looks terrible lying flat on my chest."
3.0,the under part of the dress was just too short for me
3.0,It was quite loose and the fabric was pretty sheer for me
3.0,Good thing I ordered it bigger then need
3.0,It’s somewhat thin and small. Didn’t fit my baby’s head.
3.0,I love how this watch sparkles. My only issue is that the watch arrived defective.  The piece inside the watch to indicate where the 4 and 9 were not glued in on the face of the watch. They were towards the bottom by the number 6. I still love the watch and will keep it.
3.0,The fit is perfect! The color in the picture (looks greener) differs from the one delivered (more turqouise).
3.0,"Very pretty, but to small."
3.0,Little to short
3.0,"I would say that you need to size up two sizes for these if you are pregnant. They run VERY small. Other than that, they are cute and soft!"
3.0,"I returned this blouse. Didnt like the material. The fit was too big, the sleeves were massive."
3.0,A bit small for adult face. Moderate quality
3.0,Way too small but it looked exactly what it was supposed to look!
3.0,"its a bit smaller than what I like, but still a great buy. I bought 2, and I would buy them again, easy to wash"
3.0,"Liked the design and everything about them BUT I ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE!  My fault.........needed one size larger.  thanks, ginger<br /><br />Would like the NEXT size larger ...... not real big."
3.0,VERY sheer. Much more sheer than I anticipated. We used this for family pictures and I had to buy a body slip for underneath it.
3.0,"I am 5'11 200lbs.  I purchased 2 of these dresses in the same size.  One fit, one didn't.  The blue and yellow was too short but the orange and white draped the floor. Don't understand why that would be so 3 stars."
3.0,Really liked it but it broke within a month of wearing it at the metal part where it attaches to the watch.
3.0,Shrink as soon as washed.
3.0,More for a kid then adult; too short.  For this price you would expect it to be longer!!!!
3.0,MUCH shorter than shown. I am 5’8 and busty. Very tight in the chest and falls somewhere between tunic length and a very short dress.
3.0,Very nice but a little see thru.  Had to return.
3.0,This is fine if you wear something underneath.  The shoulders and neckline just fall away
3.0,"This is a cute little navy blue, long-sleeved shirt with white writing. I will use it more as a nightgown than dress. It is comfortable and has a positive message “When you can’t find the Sunshine, Be the sunshine” on the front. Overall, I don’t like this as a dress, but a nightshirt yes!"
3.0,"I bought the 'pink' midi dress in Large. First of all the darts for your breasts are too high! Second the fabric is scratchy. This dress could be very flattering if it fit me correctly. I love the color and the length. Its not a baby pink, its more of a salmon color. Returning :("
3.0,"I ordered these sunglasses before and loved them till a lens popped out. I just ordered and recieved the same ones, however they did not send the mirror ones, they are more of a smokey finish. Don't know what went wrong. I will keep them as they look good and the price is cheap."
3.0,"It slid in well enough and my husband loves the print but it rocks on each side. Obviously the band included with the watch fits perfectly. It’s not an issue right now, but it does concern me a little about the longevity."
3.0,Okay. Colors not as rich in person.
3.0,"the quality of kuromis face is a lot different than i was expecting. it’s a very rough patch and i was thinking it’d be a lot softer. it stretches out so you can put it over your head but regardless on it being able to stretch, it still feels way too small/tight. i ordered the same size i usually would for any other clothing but this made me regret not getting a size up."
3.0,Pockets stick out and it feels like cheap fabric
3.0,"La tela es diferente a lo especificado.La talla es Grande,queda muy holgada!"
3.0,Stiff even after washing several times. Elastic waist band rolls inside casing.
3.0,It's rose gold not gold
3.0,The legs are really long but overall cute set
3.0,"not what I thought they were, would not but again!"
3.0,My one complaint is that the rear pockets aren’t deep enough.  My wallet barely fits in the back pocket.  The pocket isn’t deep enough for the flap on the rear pocket to close when the wallet is in.  That’s my only complaint.  The material feels durable.
3.0,"(These do look cute with a short skirt and heels—a nice fun look.)<br /><br />I ordered these because I was curious, though they came in a medium and a small would fit my 5’2” 117 pound frame better than the medium.<br /><br />These would be fine for wearing under a skirt with some heels. With higher boots, no, since I don’t see the point of covering your legs and not your feet with regular high boots. But maybe with some shorter booties if you want that look with a skirt may be cute.<br /><br />I wouldn’t wear them with pants as I can’t stand the feel of pantyhose with pants! And you’d still have those bare feet.<br /><br />Actually, I rarely rarely wear pantyhose and especially control top as they feel too constricting, but in the winter I sometimes like to wear opaque hose with a skirt, and thought these would just be a new look for me to try. In theory the idea was great in my head but the look didn’t translate as well as I hoped!<br /><br />I think I wanted them thicker? Like leggings? Perhaps? And not so pantyhose-like. Though there it is in the name: pantyhose.<br /><br />They are what they are. Nothing exciting. Something different for a different look.<br /><br />The price at just under $15 for two isn’t unreasonable. They seem to be well constructed. I washed them in a lingerie bag and hung them to dry and they did fine. So far no snags or runs but I haven’t worn them long enough yet—after wearing for several hours or longer, I’ll be back to report if they snag or run easily.<br /><br />These were an impulse order. I likely will wear them a time or two but more than likely they’ll end up in my sock/tights drawer where I’ll forget I have them.<br /><br />Note that I ordered a medium and they fit pretty tight. A small may have made them even less opaque."
3.0,Cute watch but not good quality. This one you get what you pay for. I wore this for about 2 weeks and it broke. I tried super glue but that still was not working. Sadly I was not able to return this item or else I would have.
3.0,"Comfortable enough. The material doesn't look quite as cheap as some other reviewers intimated. The collar color choice is somewhat odd and it's disappointing that folding the collar down doesn't really hide it (you have that white color constantly poking out). The button stitching is of very poor quality-- several of the buttons were falling off coming out of the package. Wouldn't be surprised if the rest of the stitching started to fall apart after a couple months.<br />Two small notes:<br />1. It didn't come with a pocket square sewn in, despite the picture and description saying it would.<br />2. The entire jacket was damp when I opened it?!? It dried out fine with no smell or anything, but it was odd. I didn't factor this into my rating, but it was weird.<br />All in all I probably wouldn't buy this again."
3.0,Really disappointed in these leggings as I ordered them before and they were a nice cotton knit thick fabric on the outside and the fleece on the inside was much warmer.
3.0,"Nice fitting sweatshirt - I seized up to get the baggy loose fit look. Hem hit me around hip bone level when I pulled it down. Fron the first time I wore it the sleeves had lots of loose threads from the inside which I had to constantly snip off. If these threads got caught, it would cause the cuffs to get pulled so I'm not sure how long this will last. The quality does reflect the cheap price."
3.0,Kind of larger for a Pandora bracelet and the two pieces do not fit close together like it appears in the picture.
3.0,Looked and felt great but my normal xl was too small for me. Returned.
3.0,"The hat was okay quality. And I liked the black on black design. But for an adjustable hat, it is huge. If you have an XL head, or maybe even an XXL head, this is the Steelers hat for you. Unfortunately I have an average, or perhaps smaller than average size head, and I will be returning it."
3.0,I actually like these asymmetrical earrings. They remind me of another designer style by Betsy J. These are really pretty but I took 2 ⭐'s off because they arrived damaged. The posts were bent. The box it comes in is too thin for these earrings.<br />I did order a replacement but 1 post was also slightly bent and the replacement set came in a smaller box. You can see the posts and the box sizes in my photos.<br /><br />The replacement set will not be returned even tho 1 post was bent. It just wasn't as badly bent.<br /><br />I'd suggest the seller get taller boxes but that's my opinion.
3.0,"It seemed very well made, but the pink was not the right pink for my dress and the dark green feathers seemed depressing, not elegant."
3.0,not very comfortable fit. Sits to far from face letting air under glasses when traveling in a boat
3.0,Very pretty but the fit isn't great.
3.0,Way too bulky for me. The 3 glasses holder is better.
3.0,No arch support which is very uncomfortable for me. Hurt my knees. Had to return.
3.0,"It does look kind of cheap, my bridesmaids said no to this one. Kind of scratchy"
3.0,"Nice color, but a little big big!"
3.0,I love these socks for airplane travel ; they really reduce swelling in ankles in feet especially on long flights; but I ordered a medium and got a small Bc that's what their medium really is:/ in the airport I actually got the medium and they were more comfortable!
3.0,"The picture of this handbag is beautiful, and, 'in person' it is a rather handsome purse, HOWEVER, the description said it is a 'structured' purse. I am assuming this meant it is NOT one of those slouchy bags. When manufactured/stored, the FLAT bottom was bent in half, and the entire handbag came as flat as a pancake and this means the purse will most definitely NOT stand up on the little gold feet when placed on a flat surface. I attempted to bend the &#34;cardboard&#34; (or whatever the flat piece in the bottom is), but this did not work. Therefore I have a lovely, inexpensive purse that has nice gold metal 'feet' on the bottom but the bottom is round, not flat,  and I don't think anything is going to change that.  I will not return because it is just too much hassle and etc, etc.  It looks good, though!!!  Remember, you get what you pay for, most definitely."
3.0,Though this is a very beautiful necklace. The pendant will not fit on the chain without altering it. I have tools and was able to but if you don't know how to and don't have the proper tools the pendant and chain are useless together.
3.0,"Color of ameythist was dull in richness n drad in color, nice sized but dull coloring so I give it a Promising 3."
3.0,"Good mittens, but too big. We ordered a small-medium toddler for my son who wears 2T and 3T, but these are way too big. Will save them for next year."
3.0,Very plain and much smaller and stone much plainer than depicted.
3.0,Seems like good quality but it was too big in the chest/long torso for me. I wish there was a way to exchange vs paying more to rebuy it.
3.0,"Fits great for medium, I'm size 32 pants, 160 lbs at 5 foot 7.  Complaint I have is that the quiver isn't included. It's in the pics and under the description says accessories included. Should state everything included except the quiver. Now I'll have to go to sports authority and hope to<br />Find one in time for Halloween. The arm sleeves are a little too big I'll just sew them to fit properly...  Also the suspender looking thing it comes with not sure it doesn't fit right. Should come with instructions how to put that thing on ;) I'll post pics soon"
3.0,"Thought this looked fine, but the mesh portion at the top was very itchy. I ended up returning, but probably would have kept if not for this issue."
3.0,I didn't like these at first but I've gotten a little more used to them. The reading portion at the bottom seems too small and the view is distorted in the middle. I thought I'd be able to wear them around the house but the distortion is too distracting. They work ok for reading when I'm in a chair or playing a game on my tablet while watching tv. Wish I'd have gotten ones with a bifocal line instead.
3.0,Requires a really low ponytail for the ponytail to go through the loop.
3.0,"Cheep, break easy"
3.0,Bought this for a luau-themed party.  Adorable print and love the sleeveless and tie-front.  This top does run a bit big though so go down a size.
3.0,First off this isn’t a cotton tshirt lol it’s a shiny fabric polyester dress w 3/4 sleeves and almost knee length beside that it is actually pretty cute so I am keepin it but like if you want a tshirt and not a dress then yeah lol
3.0,"Meh.  It works as a gym bag but not quite as intended in my case. My gym has split width locker (a half shelf with a longer side so that clothes can hang down).  It doesn't fit across the shelf so it tips into the longer side.  Otherwise, it's fine.  I would not recommend keeping your shoes in the bag over the full day in a hot car.  While there is ventilation, it can still lead to some pretty ripe smells."
3.0,"It came to me broken. I had the tools to fix it but it is uneven and i was so sad about it. I received it just in time for a special event i wanted to wear it to. I wore it crooked and all, because i really loved it. The necklace broke again later in the night. so bummed."
3.0,doesn't stretch and runs small but its very pretty.  The arm holes are too narrow.
3.0,"These shoes are everything my 4 year old dreamed of! The ONLY thing is that the bows constantly fall off and we have to worry over losing them. I've tried hot glueing them and they keep falling off. They are as cute as the pictures. The jelly is super comfortable for her. They don't have the weird plastic smell, which is a super plus! They're her new favorite shoes!"
3.0,"Thought it was black but it's more brown! I'm normally a size M/L but because everyone said it runs small, I decided to buy the XL! It fits like a Large would. A bit too much fabric wraps around the front. Would be cuter with less fabric wrapping around. For the price I may keep it!"
3.0,Mixed feelings about it. Don't like the sheen much. Makes it look like a sponge...and its a bit all over the place. Can be big and look coordinated and organised but it doesnt look coordinated to me.May look better in black. However I think it will look pretty ok..dressed up. Hope to write a follow up review when I &#34;dress it up&#34;.
3.0,Cheap chain. The actual dandelion is encased in resin but it is a huge thumb size charm. Was looking for something a bit more dainty. Better suited to a child vs adult.
3.0,Okay board. Got the job done. No complaints but nothing great to say.
3.0,"Definitely too large to match the expected size. Otherwise very comfortable, light weight, and good-looking. I've ordered a size smaller, and anticipate a much better rating, if they fit as I hope."
3.0,"Says 10 hours play time? HA! Try SIX hours at most! You will need to buy two to get you through a single night unless you sleep less than 6 hours! It's not what I thought I was buying. Too tight around the head, I've never met a hat too small for me, this must be a child size advertised as adult size. Really hard to get the charger into the port through the tiny hole in the fabric. LED doesn't need to be flashing the whole time and that's so annoying, that's a really dumb feature, other bluetooth I use the light is OFF when it's connected. This is meant to keep lights from bothering me but flashes in my right eye the whole time. And I'm not sure why people say it's comfortable, it hurts to even lay down and watch a video with the hard earphone against your ear, sleeping is a pain."
3.0,"When I pull the hat down on my head, it is too long and restricts my eyesight significantly."
3.0,"I received this ring well before the estimated shipping date, and the seller did everything perfectly, but the ring itself is only worth the $3 that I paid for it.  The gemstone is made of glass and chipped and fell out sometime during shipping. But it's really pretty otherwise."
3.0,"Not really a fan of this shirt. It is a bit snugger than what I prefer. The fabric, while seems decent and well put together fells far to scratchy to me.  I also don't think the buttons will hold on well for long either, may need to throw some more thread on them."
3.0,Material is nice but fits snug in the shoulders.  Lg fits like med.
3.0,Pretty - while it lasted.  Broke in a couple of months - but as it was so inexpensive i just shrugged and know better for next time when ordering an anklet.
3.0,"Fits well, stays up on my thighs well, they just weren't as RED as I was hoping they were.. definitely very very sheer. I would recommend a more opaque option."
3.0,"These were smaller & cheaper looking that I expected, although I know they're cheap sunglasses so I got what I paid for."
3.0,Covers well but is thin
3.0,White not beige! - so disappointed I cannot wear this as it is stark paper white! In no way is it beige! It was supposed to be for a wedding- & im not the bride! Returning- wish it was beige as it was supposed to be.
3.0,The top on this fit strangely - it pulled in weird ways.  And the bottom wasn't as high-waisted as I expected - it didn't reach my belly button.  I'm sending it back.
3.0,This dress is cute by it fits snug so a couple of sizes up is needed.
3.0,Was not as thick as I was expecting.  Very pretty colors though.
3.0,I ordered these earrings and the posts are way small.  They fit the earring that I wanted them for but are too small for other earrings that have sterling silver posts that i want to swap out with these. I guess will order other posts from another Seller in the future.  But the earrings post do not infect my ears so I would say the product is real which is positive.  Just teeny tiny posts was the only issue.
3.0,Brought another one for 10 dollars that actually looks better. It's not a bad product but doesn't look like it's worth 25 dollars. It was delivered very fast also which was strange supposed to come 22-28 came on the 20th
3.0,Material is stretchy but it doesn't stay on your head really well just slides off. And there is to much material on the plus side you can cut each on in half to shorten them to fit your head better
3.0,"Very pretty, but I worry it will peel or turn my daughters finger green. Came in a plastic bag instead of a box."
3.0,Not sure I like it. Strap is too wide.
3.0,It’s too short in the waist and I am short waisted. Plenty big around just not long enough.
3.0,"I bought these for my bridesmaids and can't wait to give these to them! The color is beautiful and fit my color scheme. This is by far the best priced robe I've seen. There are some loose strings on the robe that I will have to trim. They are super light but not really see though which is perfect for a summer wedding. I did receive one robe with a tear by the seam, but I sent it back and got a new one within a week! They are a great length going to the knee or just below the knee. Overall a good purchase."
3.0,"Bigger than expected and VERY sheer, I'm not sure if I can get away without spanx with this. Might be better as a swimsuit cover up honestly."
3.0,"What you'd expect for such a low price, the sides and nose holder easily bend."
3.0,It's nice but it became tarnished after washing my hands while wearing it 5 times.
3.0,It wasn't as good as it looked online.
3.0,Good quality but the colorvis nothing like the name or picture.
3.0,"Very good looking shoe, received many compliments, however the durability is in question. It already seems to lose it shape. This is more of a office walk around shoe , it seems to me not to  fair well outside with any vigorous activity"
3.0,"The L shape of the nose stud is not bent very well, and the bar is actually quite straight, which makes the nose stud very easy to fall out of your nose. Also, because it's straight more than L shaped, the end of it tends to stick out of your nostril, making it look like you have a booger hanging out of your nose. I would give it a higher rating if the bar was a lot more curved and L shaped."
3.0,"Hey I got this product free to try. Will this product looks nice and nice bottle. But I didn't feel anything. I mean , didn't feel nothing only one side affect which is lots of gases. I'm not sure maybe that could be the food that I ate before it or the product. I will continue using at until it's done then I'll give a complete feedback of it."
3.0,I am satisfied with the product considering what I paid for it.  Plastic is somewhat flimsy and weak.  However I have yet had a chance to wear them for any sort of sport so I will cross my fingers and hope they survive.
3.0,"The top is pretty decent quality, but the shorts are the thinnest material I have ever seen. Almost like a fake silk or something similar, but incredibly thin, nearly see thru."
3.0,"Great material, substantial, drapes well and cool to the touch. Corset back adjusts nicely to curves and there's enough material in the skirt to make it look/hang right. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a 17th century style!<br /><br />I could justify keeping it (my closet already has too many black dresses!) but you might like it better."
3.0,"On the picture this dress looks much better, and color seems bright on the picture. Not what I expected. I bought it for some special occasion , but when I saw it in reality I understood it’s very simple, for daily wearing. And its not right with size, bigger than must be.  Disappointed."
3.0,"This is pretty enough. I've definitely seen better prices, styles, quality, and fit at stores like T.J. Maxx, marshals, and Ross. The cups are pretty close together and don't land in the right spot on my body. because of this, I rarely wear it."
3.0,where it bottoms together the outlining start to come apart after about 3 months
3.0,The size is decent but not good compared to others. If you are looking for a lanyard just to have then this is perfect.
3.0,These are over the head. They still hook on the ears which keep them up better. But I thought they were just face covering not neck coverings.
3.0,I love the length and the color but to my great disappointment the shirt is too small. The sizing is not correct.
3.0,"These fit nice and fit true to size.<br /><br /> I haven't heard of this brand before... two weeks in and one pair already has holes in them.  Disappointing.  They still look and feel nice, but 14 days and already have holes?!?"
3.0,"Fits good ,but no pockets"
3.0,"Feel like a swimming trunk, really thin. They fit well and are comfortable."
3.0,"Not a soft Handkerchief, but it's exactly what you pay for."
3.0,"I like the simplicity of this dress where you can wear and go. Unfortunately, it was too small especially in the chest area. The material was slick and soft. Its very flattering... It also washed well on cold and dried on medium without falling apart or shrinking."
3.0,Do not use these plugs when stretching! They are very hard to get in the first time. I really like the way they look and they are well made. But the damn things keep suction cupping to my phone screen.
3.0,I wondered how it would fasten but it was a little difficult to get it fastened but its pretty
3.0,It feels and looks cheaply made but it’s a cute concept.
3.0,Everything is great about the shirt until I washed it and now the fabric is basically peeling away/out and looks terrible after a few washes
3.0,Very small and not meant for anyone with hips.  Although it has very cute colors.
3.0,"Very cute but the lace is extremely itchy. I might be a little sensitive, but the whole things is just so soft and then it has that really rough feeling lace. It’s kind of a shame."
3.0,Pretty but the chains are very weak and broke the first time I put them on. I have large bones I have what most would consider big feet. They barely fit around my ankle.  Would be better if they lengthened and strengthened the chains
3.0,"You would have to be 6 feet 6 inches for this dress to fit right. Way, way too long !"
3.0,It was just okay.  Very hard to see thru.  I can actually see better thru a magnifier than I could this item.
3.0,"I am 5'7"" and this dress was way too short that there was no way to walk around without flashing people. It was nice and stretchy and material was nice (though on the thin side)"
3.0,I ordered this bag because I liked the color. But it's totally different from what I saw in Amazon..It's neither a pale pink nor purple but just pinkish bag. The shoulder straps' color is completely different from images! I'm pretty disappointed..
3.0,These are not tank tops  I received sleeveless shirts  They are good for what they are and useable but thought I was ordering as shown in pic
3.0,Too small to fit my ankle but used as a bracelet.
3.0,"Super cute, but Make sure to read the sizing- it fits small so you need to size up. These are costume hoodies, and do not wash well. My daughter adored it, so I had to wash it a lot and it wore out quickly. It was to be expected because I read the reviews, but again- do not be surprised"
3.0,I purchased the large and kinda big so I’m hoping they shrink in the wash
3.0,"quality is good. but colors too bright. difficult to pair with any tops. My Daughter id 9 months old, bit tight fit for her."
3.0,"One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn, but both the black and pink had a seam tear in under two months. Still worth it for $12 if you don't mind mending once in a while"
3.0,Threads in decoration started getting undone byfirst use
3.0,"Pretty but not the greatest of materials.  Plus sizing is just too difficult.  I got a size large, normally I wear a medium and it hugged in all the wrong places.  The fit is not great."
3.0,Cute necklace. Clock doesn't seem to work. Very steam punk.
3.0,It's a pretty hat but it's too small for my head.
3.0,"I wear this belt while working out and it WILL make you sweat A LOT. So if you want to be dripping in sweat around you back and mid-section, this product is definitely for you. The only con is that it starts to roll a little at the top in the back, but that doesn't take away from doing what it's meant to do."
3.0,"Not sure what the hype is all about for underarmor... Legs are kind of tight as is the butt area, trapdoor overlap is a bit excessive. Small compared to all other brands I've tried and I have a moderate athletic build."
3.0,"Good price for these sandals and the fit is OK. Soles are of a man-made plastic, no rubber, are quite stiff, and slip on many surfaces. Soles make an audible click as I lift my heel on every step, which gets to be a bit irritating."
3.0,"Bought this for my 7 yr old...arrived on time and looked the same as in the pictures. Good quality mask. However, WAY TOO BIG for my child. She's not tiny for her age, and other kid sized masks I've ordered have fit her appropriately, with no issues. This one was more adult sized than for an average sized elementary aged kiddo. I am now wearing it, with it being just a shade too snug. Great quality and comfort though, so I would definitely order adult masks from this vendor, just not for my child."
3.0,This hat is nice but too damn big.
3.0,fits in pretty small and also can be see through ehh...
3.0,"The material is good, but the gown is longer than I expected. I am 5'4"", weigh 130 lbs, 34, 32, 40. Although I often get a large in many clothes, I got only a medium after seeing the loose look. I do not like the awkward 1/2  sleeves and would prefer 3/4. The facing on the neckline is not well sewn and too narrow to keep it from twisting in one spot and showing the wrong side. The gray reminds me of prison uniforms, and I would like a subtle color and feminine pattern. It also had a scratchy tag I had to remove. It washes well."
3.0,"Cute headband.  It came folded up in package which caused the chained metal part to bend.  I was able to reshape it, but still left a little kink in the chain."
3.0,"This is a nice dress but it hits above the knee. I'm 5""8' so I was expecting it to be at least knee length. The elastic at the waist also hits about 4 inches above my waist. Nice heavy fabric and fits well otherwise, just much shorter than I like."
3.0,Looks like the price
3.0,"I am 5'6"", about 130lbs and a D-cup. I ordered the small, which fits fine, but the neck hole does not lay properly on my shoulders  (it kind of pinches up on both shoulders as if the cut was poor, I have plenty of fabric and room for around my chest, so I don't believe that's part of the issue) and the skirt arrived with a large hole down the right seam.<br />My current plan is to sew the seam, but I'm not sure yet about how to fix the shoulders<br />The fabric is a bit thinner than anticipated, but still can be worn to an office environment."
3.0,It said it was made of cotton and rayon. The label says polyester and spandex. It is cute to look at but even though I ordered a size up as was suggested it's much tighter fitting than I would prefer.
3.0,Used this track suit for a halloween costume. The arms and legs were a bit out of proportion and snug. The crotch was too high for my taste. Not a great fit but adequate for the purpose.
3.0,"Product quality was nice, color vibrant - would have been perfect if it wasn't too small.  My guy wears size 13 consistently, but his heel was hanging off.  Wish it came in size 14!"
3.0,"Teeny tiny. I suggest ordering 3 sizes up. Was not cheaply made though, very nice fabric and work."
3.0,wasn't long enough
3.0,Look ok but need better way to attach to items added to the back.
3.0,"I'm now using the second one I bought. As others have noted, each slot of the case has a long flap of cloth inside, which is supposed to serve for wiping your lenses. The cloth isn't very good for that purpose, makes it harder to get the glasses in and out, and easily jams the zipper if you're not careful. Although I love the look, feel, and practicality of this case in other respects--it holds two pairs of glasses nicely and the color-coded zipper tabs make it easy to find the right pair--the dumb cloth irreparably jammed the zipper on my first one and I had to toss it.<br /><br />This time I took a Sharp X-Acto knife and used it to cut the cloth out of the slots. The trick is to stretch the cloth and cut gently but firmly as close to the hem line as possible so that the remaining material isn't wide enough to reach the zipper track. With this modification the case becomes a five-star product.<br /><br />I'd think the manufacturer would have caught on by now and stopped including that extra material, but maybe it stays there because otherwise it would be harder to sew. In any event, I suggest choosing some other case unless you're willing and able to modify this one as described."
3.0,These are a bit slippery on the bottom and they slip off my 16 mo old sons feet too easily. Darn cuz they're just so darn cute.
3.0,I have a tiny head sooo....somewhat big but good quality!
3.0,Like the color and style- do not like that it opens or slides open so the closure is not strong enough to keep it closed
3.0,Too large that I wanted
3.0,I ordered both gold and silver. I tried the biggest size last night and they are too small. Maybe I just have big ears?!? Or my holes are too high. But they will be great for my daughter.
3.0,These are for short bodies. If you are 5’7 and above - they will sit high above your belly button making you feel weird. I didn’t like the feeling and can’t wear them. Ordered a larger and longer version.
3.0,I didn't like the fact that when I got it it didn't fit and we bought an extra large and if it's like a medium. My daughter even tried it on and she wears a large and could not fit into it
3.0,The furniture is very nice. The winders are a little noisy but work fine. The only issue is all the settings are erased with power interruption. Each time you lose power you have to re-enter each watch's settings.
3.0,Pretty but colors are a bit pale.
3.0,Its quit think but warm. Fits true to size and its so annoying to put on. The fur is ok however if you wanna zip coat fur blocks it from zipper. You have to wear it excalty like the.model in the photo and you definitely annoying... but its an ok imma make it work
3.0,"You pants are nice and thick, but the peplum leaves glitter everywhere"
3.0,The color used to stain the wood comes off if we sweat a bit or happen to get some water under your wrist. Personally I wouldn't buy this particular product again. They are getting bead bracelets out there. Granted they might not cost $4.99 but I'd rather pay a bit more then have a somewhat cheap product.
3.0,Cheap- won’t last long. Not what I was hoping for
3.0,"Fits many of my pens really weird, hard to get them in and out of the rings while it just looks weird as shown in photos. I usually don’t review products but this one disappointed me a decent amount due to how it could maybe only fit colored pencils."
3.0,It was not what I expected - I was kinda disappointed.  I ordered another ring.
3.0,The pen isn’t working after 10 mins of use
3.0,"I order this top expecting lime green accents, I received a blue accent top.  The pullover is of good quality and fits as expected. I like my pullover a bit loose for hiking and other outdoor activities, I’m just very disappointed in the inaccurate color."
3.0,It keeps you dry. More cheaply made than I expected. It’s hard to find longer raincoats. Will do if you can’t find a better product. Not sure if it’s worth the price.
3.0,It’s cute but I don’t think it’s real because it change its color it doesn’t as sparkling as the first use.
3.0,Only wore twice. Was comfortable and looked great. Had lots of compliments. Third time i went to put them in i noticed a stone was missing. Very disappointed.
3.0,Just seemed ill fitting for my daughter.  But she is short and relatively thin.  Just looked baggy on her even though we expected it to be &#34;flowy&#34;.
3.0,"It was a little to big for a medium, it's supposed to fit loose but it's too loose. I think it's a cute dress though I like the pockets on the side"
3.0,I bought XXL Kurti set. Kurti fitting is ok but pants size doesn’t fit or look like xxl. Fabric and design is beautiful  so I decided to keep it.
3.0,They run about two sizes too small so buy accordingly
3.0,LOVED THE LOOK AND FEEL BUT RUNS PRETTY SMALL.
3.0,"These would be great, but the lenses pop out all the time with the slightest bumps. They look good. They're comfortable. But the lenses don't like staying in."
3.0,"Not a bad shirt, used for soccer in the sun. No chafing etc. But it shrinks in the wash quite a bit; I would buy at least a size or two bigger."
3.0,"This is a cute shoe that fits my 3 year old as expected. Its soft and warm. However, the insole lining came off within the first week of use. That's the reason i took off two stars. Other than the one flaw, the velcro closure is easy for my kid to put the shoe on without any assistance. I wish the insole lining was made and fixed with better quality."
3.0,I like the quality and fit but the seams are too thick show through my dresses.
3.0,Love this dress. Just praying I dont break the straps.
3.0,It's an okay dress....norhong fancy!
3.0,"Cute! But I did run a little small and is itchyyy, and not as high wasted as expected- I am 5’10 and slim thick so maybe that’s. You"
3.0,The top is a little sheer and tight in the shoulders.
3.0,Loved the pants but were not a two x
3.0,Not as cute in person.
3.0,Sizes are smaller than normal. Nice material that would hang nicely if sizing was correct.
3.0,It's very cute for mommy and daughter hats. The gloves are very cheap and Not very well made they popped holes in the first day.
3.0,I received my watch ahead of time which was great. Z watch band was extremely comfortable and soft. the only problem I had was that the round face was a bit larger than I thought it was going to be there for the dial knobs stick into the top of my wrist every now and then. otherwise happy with my purchase. thank you
3.0,"I bought this pair after purchasing other pairs of these joggers without the pockets. I purchased the same size and these pants do not fit the same - they unfortunately don't fit right -- not enough fabric on the buttocks. I would also say they are not as comfortable as other pairs. Also, after one wash the metal around the drawstring came off. So I will not be purchasing these again."
3.0,Not bad for the price but the buckle is kinda loose sometimes.
3.0,"I am typically a size large. I ordered a 2x for an oversized comfy fit, but they just fit."
3.0,"I like this shirt, but not for the purpose I bought it for. I bought an xxl expecting for it to fit pretty loosely, but it is not loose at all. It's not too tight, but I wouldn't be comfortable wearing it. Just for reference I'm 5'3 and 180 lbs."
3.0,"Pretty dress, well made. No support in tummy area. I didnt like how my belly stuck out :-("
3.0,Very nice and simplistic. Don't care for the zipper option but for the price I won t complain.
3.0,A little smaller than the other dress I bought from Amazon in a med. A different brand tho.
3.0,I like this shirt but it's kinda see through...have to where a tank underneath not to cool when you get hot flashes!
3.0,"I was surprised when the backless slippers I ordered came with the heel sling. That’s wasn’t in the picture of the product so I was disappointed, I really wanted the slippers to be completely backless."
3.0,"I like the material, the fit on the arms was kinda weird but it might have been because the vest felt way too tight. I probably could have sized up by 2 sizes."
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars only because it didn’t fit exactly how I thought. It isn’t as long as it appears in the picture and was narrow between shoulders.. because if those things I will not be wearing it. However, I would give 5 stars for the quality. Well made and vibrant  colors."
3.0,"This is REALLY big. I have purchased several &#34;One Size&#34; items but NOTHING like this tent. I'll probably keep it to wear around the house or as pajamas, though because it's cheap & cute enough to do so. This item is more ideal for a 24W-30W woman, with PLENTY of room to give."
3.0,it will get dark on the back if you wear jean
3.0,Overall this romper is very cute. It fits will around the body but is definitely short..I struggle to get in and out of it because its short (I'm only 5' 4''). Customer service is good though...I contacted them about the issue and they were apologetic and offered two options to remedy the issue.
3.0,Gift wise it was a pretty good gift but when it came to using it it broke over 2 days. I was able to fix it and it broke again a week later and I couldn’t fix it so I just gave up on it.
3.0,"Durability is a only fair. I have to replace these socks after about 45 hours of Kick Boxing use because there are now large holes in the bottom of both socks. (See pics.) After about 35 hours of use a small hole developed and small pieces of black foam started coming out of the sock.<br />I weigh 165 pounds and train on a Dojo with plastic mats.<br />After each use, I wash it by hand in lukewarm water with no detergent, and hang to dry."
3.0,"Although the stone was generally pretty, it was very bulky and I ended up returning it."
3.0,It's not as impressive as it looks. it went unnoticed.
3.0,Tarnished. Otherwise cute.
3.0,Don’t really care for it. Didn’t realize it was a hat for a ponytail. I have short hair.
3.0,"No me gusto mucho la calidad, muy delgada la tela y medio transparente"
3.0,"I should have checked the specification on this before ordering.  It is rather small, so much so, that you can barely see the photo.<br /><br />Okay, but not great…"
3.0,Too long and heavy but it still looks nice. Very sturdy.
3.0,Me dio alergia el material con que esta fabricada es un mateerial muy sencillo no las use mas
3.0,Very nice dress but not for summer wear due to it is heavy!
3.0,"A little disappointed in the shape of these, not exactly how the picture looks. These are light weight."
3.0,"Size was XXL, big still too small"
3.0,"The hat is very nice, the idea about the face shield is good, but the quality of the plastic is not. It’s a strange type that makes seeing through it problematic. I sometimes get dizzy looking through it."
3.0,"It doesn't spin by the knobs on the side and the chain isn't very long, but for the price an ok gift."
3.0,great looking but a little hard to buckle
3.0,"These fit large/loose. The memory foam cushion is comfortable, but has &#34;balled up'' under my toes on one slipper. They are nice looking slippers, but I'm not happy with the cushion messing up."
3.0,"Watsh looks good but you have to resync it every week or so or it will start telling the wrong time, a few weeks ago it was a few hours ahead, a few minutes ago it was only off by 10 seconds or so, but I'm sure it would have drifted further if I hadn't received synced it<br />Update: the second hand has fallen off probably my fault since I tossed it onto a pallet jack, but it's kinda useless if it can't stand up to daily abuse"
3.0,"I got two of these--the yellow/red fall pattern and the green/orange cityscape. This review reflects my experience with both dresses. I love the skirt part of this, but the cut of the waistline looks ridiculous on me. In the product photo, it looks like the waist falls at the natural waist, but on me, it falls just under my breasts. Then, the pleated skirt flares out, making the waist start way too high. I look pregnant in it. I plan to have a local tailor cut off the shirt and make it so I can just wear the skirt. The skirt is really cute once I pull it down to my natural waistline. I love the design and the colors of both skirts. The yellow/red one will look really cute this fall with a dark red fitted t-shirt and some dark red heels. Oh, and the belt it comes with? UGLY and cheap. The bow fell off the first time I tried it on. I could have fixed it with some hot glue, but I would never wear that belt anyway."
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" 125lbs 30FF and I received this in a small.<br /><br />The bandeau has tighter elastic in the bottom and top so it's not as supportive as I'd like. The pads are very large and round so they seem noticeable under a shirt to me. Pads are removable but then there's absolutely no support or shape.<br /><br />It okay I guess if you want something to quickly slip on at home but nothing great."
3.0,"Honestly, they're not terrible shirts for the money. My biggest issue was they don't really compress that much... which is the point of the shirt. 2.5/5."
3.0,First jacket recieved had a faulty zipper and needed to be sent back. Second jacket sent had a lining which was getting caught in zipper. Had to have lining tacked down to allow zipper to move freely.
3.0,it works well but it’s not as wide as it appears in the picture and I would prefer something wider and waterproof
3.0,"Fit is okay, but made out of very cheap material."
3.0,"The quality of the suit itself is surprisingly decent for the price, but this definitely seems to be made for those with a shorter torso. I have an average to long torso but it's usually not a big deal with halter style swimsuits because you can buy a bit of extra length with straps. Not in this case, however. Not unless I want my entire chest to be on parade."
3.0,"It is way too big for me,  Cannot adjust it down small enough"
3.0,"My daughter loves these, but they are a little expensive for what you get"
3.0,"I gave this dress three stars only because it didn't fit me. It's a cute dress, I was looking for something to wear to a wedding but this dress wasn't  dressy enough for the wedding I'm going to. It has a stretchy feel to it but I couldn't zip it up."
3.0,"These cut my hands all up, like paper cuts, nothing huge or dramatic. They are not comfortable by any stretch of the imagination. I wore them because I was doing a stilt walking gig in the winter, they kept my hands warm but it was like being stuck with pins."
3.0,"I was expecting a little overzized but it is fitted on me.  Other then that, I have received many compliments."
3.0,Love the design and was a fun piece to wear doing a deadlift Christmas fundraiser. The only issue I had with it is that it shrunk considerably after one wash. I would recommend buying a much larger size and washing it first before you wear it.
3.0,"The Reef Draftsman is a nice sandal, but it has an issue. As more than one reviewer has mentioned, the bottle opener is felt in the arch area and thus would make this sandal difficult to wear for a long stretch.  It is fairly light, but flat, so there isn't much heel cushion.  I returned them."
3.0,I love these style of leggings and the price is great but after the first wash one of my pockets the sewing is coming undone :(. I would rate 5 stars if it wasn't coming apart.
3.0,"Super soft, high quality shirt but it has a oddly large armpit hole. Going to keep it as a sleep shirt since its super comfy. I'm 5'8 about 150lbs and ordered the large since I like my clothes fitting loose."
3.0,"These leggings are super comfy, especially for the price.  Feel wise they are comparable to Lula Roe leggings!  The only reason I'm giving a 3 is the second pair i put on i ended up being told 10 minutes into wearing them there was a hole on the behind near the seem.  The other two pair are in great shape!"
3.0,"A bit longer than I expected but I can easily modify that myself, otherwise it fits great."
3.0,"I like the look of these, but they are not as soft as I would like.  The arm and legs are also a little short so they are made for people under 5'7 I would say.  They do wash well."
3.0,It looks more like art splotches than waves but it is still stunning against the sun!
3.0,"Looks good on paper but cheaply made in reality. this is a good example of a good concept that went bad at the production. it does not have the weight and the presence you would expect from a watch with this design ; it is actually as light as a $5 watch you would buy in a street market. This is probably the reason why they show a drawing of the product on Amazon rather that an actual picture of the watch; a real picture of the watch would definitely lower the expectation and sales.<br />I collect watches (more than 500 of them) and this one is not on the top of my list.<br />pro: design concept, originality, comfortable<br />Con: material, finish, cheap, look<br />overall, I recommend to buy it with a low expectation"
3.0,"The light is kind of not good managed by its self, we have to manually to change the light color."
3.0,"These were a bit if a miss for me. My biggest problem was the slides didn't slide easily or smoothly & as an adult I shouldn't need help to put this type of bracelet on. The other thing that I really didn't care for was that the thread is quite stiff & not soft at all really so it didn't feel very nice against my skin. The colors are vibrant & contrast each other nicely & it is a set of six but in the end it's not something I will wear.<br /><br />Pros: Nice vibrant colors, larger set of 6<br /><br />Cons: Some appeared to have smudges of dirt on them, a few were not as tidy looking as the others, they are stiff & not soft & the slides do not slide easily so not easy for all to use.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product thus far. I will update if things change. Please see pics with my review for reference. I did receive this product for free but that has in no way influenced my review. I depend on honest reviews to buy the best products I can within my budget therefore I strive to be thorough in my reviews! I personally choose, test & use all products I receive before leaving a review. If this review helped please let me know by clicking the helpful button!"
3.0,Wear out quickly - bought 2 pair and they hardly lasted a month each.
3.0,Cute but super thick. It covers most of my hair and looks a little funny
3.0,Shrunk after one washing
3.0,"Shorter than pictured. No pleats. More like a super-sized t-shirt. On the plus side, material is soft and comfy."
3.0,"I absolutely love their bike shorts for running. I’ve shared this company with friends and family after I bought five pairs of their shorts. I was excited to try their leggings for the colder months. Doesn’t seem like the same material. The material doesn’t seem as thick or as smoothing. Also, the pants kept sliding down while I ran which made me feel like a running human biscuit can. These pants were relegated to to the “sit around and watch Netflix” pile."
3.0,"Runs at least two sizes smaller than average. Thankfully I ordered up more than usual because of regular Asian sizing, but it was just about dead on when it arrived. The quality isn’t terrible, but I don’t think it’s going to stand up to the tests of time."
3.0,"The band is beautiful and seems like it would be comfortable, but it is missing the pins required to connect it to the watch head, making it useless."
3.0,if u have big breasts DONT get this. it does NOT support them lmao
3.0,"Nice product very light though, buy for a child."
3.0,"These are a great concept, and will work well when planting pots or using in well-prepared flower or vegetable gardens. In my soil the claw tips tend to twist, causing lack of control & discomfort. They do seem to be waterproof, and the claws are sturdy. I used them repotting several items and they performed very well. They're also handy for scooping potting soil out of the bag to fill pots and gives you more control than bowl-or cup-type implements for that purpose.<br /><br />I might purchase them for limited purposes, but they in no way replace my standard gardening gloves and tools."
3.0,"Great colors, fit was questionable. As was quality."
3.0,"Talk about a sexy one piece... this is it. It's really pretty but don't move or your boobs will fall out. It's almost like it needs some kind of tape or something in the breast area. But, if you are literally going to  just lay out and not move, you'll catch what you came for, if you know what I mean ;)"
3.0,"This is a top brand, this things should happen , it gets unstitched  below the arms."
3.0,Turned dark blackish color within a day !
3.0,Really pretty bigger than I expected I also didn't like the backs of the earrings. Because they were big the backs didn't support very well also earrings are heavy in my ear lobes. But they are pretty. I just wish were smaller lighter and better backings.
3.0,Not as big as expected . Cheap material .
3.0,"I purchased a single to see if this mask would meet my needs.  It had good construction, ear holes and a rich dark green color.  So i went ahead and purchased 2 of the 2 packs so that I would have 5 masks for the work week.  The two packs arrived- no ear holes and a completely different color.  Buyer beware!"
3.0,"At the risk of looking stupid on the internet, I am posting a picture. The shirt is a mixed bag. And yep, as I figured, the picture is false. This is where it gets confusing:<br /><br />More silky and not cottony at all like it looks in the picture (and I wish it was cotton as it would be more comfy). The waist has tons of room, but the chest is much smaller and tighter and pushes tightly against the chest, giving no room for your girls. Got an XL after looking at measurements, but I guess I needed a 1X or 2X all along. The torso and sleeves are not as long in the picture, nor are they as flowy. They are 3/4 sleeves and the lace on the shoulders is untrimmed and looks sloppy. However, it's an easy fix with scissors. Very see through, so you want to wear something under it. The smell of it is horrible coming out of the bag, so you definitely want to wash it after getting it.<br /><br />No point in me returning it to China, but I do kind of like it. Despite flaws, it is comfy. The lace (after trimming) and shoulders look great. I may get it in a bigger size, but the insanity of the sizing on overseas products makes it frustrating to even figure out what size to get! I suggest that if you are busty, whatever size they say works for you, go one up. As for the one I got, I will donate it to Goodwill."
3.0,Nice jacket. Recommend to order 2 sizes up!
3.0,Pretty dress great for summer. A little thinner than I'd like. I have not worn it out yet but I am afraid it might be see through. Fits true to size
3.0,is fit but the model is not the same we saw in the picture
3.0,"More for bigger kids, kids who are 8 and older my kids swim in it"
3.0,The fit was not the best
3.0,A size small fits like a Men’s Large T Shirt
3.0,Got this in mail today. Examined the dress. Right Sleeve strap that holds sleeve up has grey stain on it.  Dress so white makes stain visible.  I'm not trying to go outside w stain on dress. And I'm not washing this long dress before I wear it.  Fits well.  Not happy w stain.  Came wrinkled from being folded so long. I hate ironing.  I just don't know if I will be buying clothes from Amazon. I never really buy clothes on Amazon.  Only household and beauty stuff.
3.0,I loves these glasses and they most definitely help with my migraines but the lenses keep popping out of the frames.
3.0,There were no extra links for making the band longer and it is a bit tight. The watch itself is beautiful.
3.0,It cracks start to look bad after awhile.
3.0,"It was really cute, but the torso was too long..."
3.0,"The color of this dress was beautiful!  I ordered blue and I loved the color.  It is labeled as a formal dress, but without the ""cape"" pieces would be better labeled as a summer dress because of the fabric.  Every roll, nook and cranny will show in this dress because of the way it clings to the body.  Definitely order a size or two larger, it won't hurt!  The length of the dress was great.  I wore 4"" heels and I'm 5'4"".<br />I wore the dress to a banquet, but had I better prepared, I would have chosen a different dress.  Again, it served its purpose, but it wasn't the type of quality I'm used to."
3.0,The are very pretty and the quality is good but they are very short and don't stay up. I'm constantly pulling them up. They slide down.
3.0,"Loved the wooden design and such, but the screws could have used loctite or something similar. After a month, one screw got lost, and was still usable. After the second one got lost, the only thing they work for is frames."
3.0,"For smaller heads only!  Otherwise:  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!<br /><br />Inexpensive and poorly made, the quantity and bright colors almost even things out.<br /><br />I sweat a lot because of a medication I need for a chronic condition so I go through a lot of sweat bands. Even with the low cost I would not buy these again because they are too tight for everyone in my family and poorly made.<br /><br />One of my cats loves them and steals them; she is welcome to hunt and kill them to her hearts content.  They hit her better than they fit me!"
3.0,I expected them to be a little more larger.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, it's not a quality cz, but I was hoping for something a little better. It's something I wear to change things up. It has okay &#34;fire&#34;. It's pretty ."
3.0,Looks more like a nightgown than a dress
3.0,"Kinda looks home-made, but does the job and didn't cost as much as one I'd previously bought that was  metal-tone plastic."
3.0,I have mixed feelings about this. I purchased to wear for Christmas and a cruise. It's a nice heavy weight but I think it looks quite bad without adding a belt aside from the tie waist. I think I will be donating it. The color and fabric is nice but the romper is somewhere between too plain and too much to add accessories easily.
3.0,"Made very small for sizes over 12 or 14 missy, for the price mine was made pretty nice."
3.0,A little on the small side for a size 10.5--they're constantly slipping off my heel in my shoes.
3.0,"Its pretty from a distance, but had black marks on it. It arrived slighty bent in the middle, but I was able to easily bend it back into its shape. It looked very nice on my daughter and went beautifully with her prom dress."
3.0,These are not that bad. I ordered the black pair and they are shiney in the light though and they are a light shade of black. Other than that the shorts aren't bad.
3.0,"I purchased one version of this purse in a department store, and was able to carry it for a LONG time without the straps breaking or getting those ugly zebra lines in it from the weight of the purse. From this experience, I fell in love with the purse. Then I came on Amazon and purchased this purse thinking it was the exact same purse. I soon came to find out that is is not.<br /><br />Cons<br />1, The straps are not able to properly support the weight of the purse over time. The purse straps start to get those UGLY zebra lines.<br />2. The overall purse size was a bit smaller<br /><br />Pros<br />1. New velcro flap helps secure large back pocket in the inside purse area<br />2. Purse is still roomy and accommodates people that need to carry more than the basics in their purse"
3.0,The size advertised did not match reality and expectations.  Good quality dress otherwise.
3.0,Meh. Too tight and stiff. Don't care for the fabric. Might try a size up and different color.
3.0,The two simple bands are not connected in a complete loop so my skin pinches sometimes.  The leaves are all stuck as if someone forgot to punch out the metal between the leaves.  I love the heart ring.
3.0,"The sterling silver spacers are of good quality, but with the rubber ring inside they wouldn't fit on my bracelet."
3.0,"Top part fits great but the bottom part is definitely too small. I ordered a large. 5'4, 118 pounds."
3.0,"Bracelet is okay. Round bead is plastic, though. We were giving this for a gift, so now have to go find a brass bead to replace it."
3.0,"It certainly will prevent injuries to your  arm, scratches, cuts  etc from yard or general work issues. I found mine to be hot, and not a great fit for my arm.<br />Info etc in Chinese, so...."
3.0,The earrings were all cute
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this Ofenbuy Womens Lace Embroidery Dress. The fabric is great, just the perfect lightweight cotton in a nice eyelet type lace design which looks very high end. The dress is nicely finished and it is even lined in the same color solid fabric adding to the overall modesty of the piece which lends itself to not needing a slip.<br /><br />Unfortunately, unless you are very short and very small breasted, I'm not sure this dress will work for you. I am 5'6"", 200 lb with a 38D bra size and an average torso.  I carry most of my weight in my midsection. I ordered the extra large. The top and collar of this dress did not fall as shown in the photos, not because of my size, but because the top portion did not even reach my breast line! It was way too short proportionally to the rest of the dress. I am not sure if mine was just flawed but the dress is totally unwearable for me, despite my being within the guidelines for the measurements.<br /><br />This dress may work for someone who is petit, but it is definitely a no go for anyone taller or larger."
3.0,Size runs small. Very heavy as well
3.0,I love the size and color but it has a very bad odor to it and I can't get it to go away.
3.0,Heel slips down after a while
3.0,The three different tones are not very defined
3.0,To big and baggy. Pants were way too big.
3.0,Decent quality but several feathers have already fallen out.
3.0,Patch is smaller than in photo
3.0,The bottom was great but the top had no support.
3.0,"This bag came folded in a 3x4 box - terribly wrinkled.  The bag itself is ok, just looked terrible when I opened it!"
3.0,"Meh. Material seems cheap, itchy, and it arrived already unraveling. Colors less vibrant than pictured. I'm returning it as I don't think it's worth the money spent"
3.0,S'aight
3.0,"Product looks good, haven't used it yet. I do wish it had some type of snap closure.  It bulges open with just the passport in it. Don't even have any money or credit cards in it. My concern is will it still be protected from disclosure if not closing tightly.  Needs a sleeve or rubber band I guess."
3.0,"I used their size chart and ordered an XL for my 6.2 and 225 lbs frame.  It was at least a size too large.  I'm an XL all day long and this was loose and baggy on me.  Size down if you're lean and like a fitted look.  On the flip size, the shirt is made of nice stretch material."
3.0,Pros:<br />-Product fit my husband great.<br />- Keeps him really warm and works as undergarments in cold weather.<br />-Nice and thin so he doesn’t look/fee bulky with clothing over it.<br />-Great price for thermal wear<br /><br />Cons:<br />-washed and air dried/hung once and started to pile up everywhere.<br />-Tesla wording iron on on front is pealing off<br />-collects lint like nothing I’ve ever seen before<br />-great for short term use. Probably won’t expect to get long term wear or even one season out of it.<br /><br />Still great for the price if you live somewhere warm and are going on a trip to somewhere cold. Would buy again for that purpose.<br />**Photos are after one wash and air dry**
3.0,"Like:  Watch face is adorable<br /><br />Dislike:<br />- Hard to read (even though I have ""new eyes"" from cataract surgery<br />- arrived with band separate - though packaged well, there were no instructions<br />- it is very hard to assemble."
3.0,Fits well. Cute and warm. Perfect thickness that I wanted but I did not swipe through all the pictures to realize some had eyes printed on them. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,Like the material and color. But the cut is way too small. I don’t like a tight shirt.
3.0,I expected this shirt to be fitted in the waist as shown in the picture. As you can see it is not. I normally wear a Medium but ordered Large because I expected it too be fitted. I will keep it and wear with jeans or leggings. The material feels nice but I no instructions on how it should be washed. I will be washing in cold water and drying on low temperature setting.
3.0,Coaching shoe on turf.
3.0,They are light & flimsy material
3.0,"Cheaply made. Feels like wearing a table cloth. The material is not soft. And fits larger, not really true to the size I ordered, very loose."
3.0,"Where I live, men are large & happy...Not quite big enough for the man I had in mind ~ Keeping it any way."
3.0,VERY VERY  FRAGILE  -  WILL BREAK  AT SLIGHTEST  TUG
3.0,"First off these are nice pieces, even undersized, for the price. I posted a picture next to true 7mm bead and you can tell these are much smaller. However I have gotten fake pearls listed as real on amazon and these are at least real.<br /><br />Mine came in a nice cardboard box so it looks like they have fixed that shipping issue others noted.  They were also well centered on the post unlike what other people reported, so it looks like the seller is doing a very good job correcting issues. They are not perfectly round, and the silver posts came tarnished. I will easily be able to clean that off and I suppose that means they are at least real silver, are they really 925, I don't know??... Overall I am happy with these and they could be great with a change to the description over the sizing just so you know what you are getting."
3.0,"Worked well for my Comic Con costume! The adhesive that comes with the eyebrows is great, albeit a tad uncomfortable on the skin.  When I reused it, I attached some spirit gum, which unfortunately did not adhere as well, so this feels like a one use product, which is disappointing considering everything else that is out there.  Not bad at all overall, though."
3.0,"Not fitted at all, also the dress goes on just like a robe with only a snap at the bust to secure it, the tie serves a purpose, but there is nothing holding that on either. Kinda felt like a 50s sleeping dress."
3.0,Shirt ran really big. My thin daughter had to have a tie in the back to make it fit
3.0,"Not thrilled; these were not the gladiator inspired flip flop alternative I was looking for.<br /><br />They seem more trendy and youthful online (I bought them in black) - they look, on a foot, more like one of those numerous ""grown up flip flop"" options with crossy things and the like, except these also have a back strap.<br /><br />Being a teen looking for a more summery offering, I would say that these look a little too teva rather than trendy."
3.0,"the chain constantly twists the wrong way and it's frustrating will not buy again. it's extremely cheap, do not buy it"
3.0,"Material is very flimsy and was easily bent out of place. Super cute, just wish it held its integrity better."
3.0,"I ordered these pj's in Navy and in a Large since I'm 5'8"", 155lbs.  The top is boxy but I was happy that it's long enough.  It fits well across the shoulders but is not a tight fit across my stomach.  The bottoms are plenty long enough for me but are a bit tight at the waist.  I definitely don't need the drawstring!  If you find that uncomfortable then I'd suggest sizing up or skipping these.  The feel is soft and I didn't get too warm in them overnight.  Overall, I like them but don't love them."
3.0,"I wish the strap was adjustable, it not tight enough around my foot :( Otherwise it’s a beautiful shoe, I haven’t walked in them yet but the sole feels supportive."
3.0,Item offers great sun Protection .Item was wrong color for me.
3.0,I loved the black ones only.
3.0,I didn't like that one was  broken so i super glued them with gorilla glue
3.0,"Pretty but this is a dolphin, not a shark!"
3.0,No where as long as stated
3.0,I got the plus size. Yes it does look small but it should fit fine. They do fit as you would think though from only being plus or plain. A little small and mine actually ripped right at the seem of the crotch area
3.0,"Fabric was thin, could see thru white areas"
3.0,"I really wanted to love it, I wore it for maybe 2 hours at home and decided not to keep it.<br /><br />Pros: Denim is very nice, soft enough and has a right amount of stretch, I did not feel stiff sitting down. It was actually very comfortable (aside of straps problem, but more on that down below). I enjoy the long zip line detail, it looks stylish and it caught my eye in the first place.<br /><br />Cons: Shoulder straps are not staying in place. I zipped up the piece with my chest being a bit squished, so straps looked in place. But after half an hour or so straps started to fall down and I was stuck in the loop of constantly fixing them upwards. Maybe my shoulders have a shape that doesn't hold straps well, but I think it would help if they were adjustable or if they were crisscrossed. I was also hoping for sexy farmer look, but it just didn't feel that sexy and I had more reasons to part with that piece."
3.0,Loved the feel and the color. The size carries small. The lenght isn’t what I expected. And the twist part looks nothing the advertised picture. Kind of a bummer.
3.0,The top nub kept coming out of the notch. Other than that I like the bands.
3.0,Liked the scarf.  Wrong pattern sent. Did order a couple other scarves and they were very nice. Thank you very much.
3.0,3.5 stars I’d say. Good for hair coloring but not really sturdy for cleaning. 500 pieces was good value for price! If you want to use it for handling mail should be ok. Not for hospitals or service workers- too flimsy.
3.0,Could use a little more support.  but super soft and comfortable
3.0,these are kinda like thigh high tights. i was looking more for sock material. pricey for the material its made of
3.0,"The gaiters were on the small size, they worked for the younger kids (5 years old) but were too tight for the the older kids (8 and 10 years old)."
3.0,Cheap feel and the back pocket being in the middle of your butt is a really bad design in my opinion. Fit was good and they are light weight.
3.0,Nice enough phone case. I bought it because reviews said it does work with wireless charging and yet it doesn't. Meh.
3.0,"I liked the Dress, but it was not true to size so unfortunately I will have to return it."
3.0,the size was a little small
3.0,After the batter died and was replaced it would not maintain it proper functioning.
3.0,Looks nice and all but an xl fit me small had to give to my son
3.0,"It says that the two pieces can separate from each other, but I won't do that. I would be afraid of breaking the earring. Other than that the earrings look fine - good with a pair of dark blue jeans."
3.0,"The colors are a bit faded, and the fit is weird. The legs were long enough for me, but the torso was too short, and the fit was tighter than expected. Returning."
3.0,Love the design. The material just rolls up constantly. It’s spandex like
3.0,Nice top but needs to be hand washed. Love the design but very flimsy after washing.
3.0,"I gave it three stars because i like the dress but its not as long as i expected it to be, it actually comes mid thigh."
3.0,"Based on the picture, and the fact that it supposed to be dressy, I expected the sleeves of us to be a little bit better quality than T-shirt material."
3.0,ok for looks but not for everyday use.
3.0,I owned a pair of the big hoops and I wanted to buy the small size one but one of the clasp is very lose very disappointed
3.0,"When I put this on my ring is left scratched all the way around my ring from both ends of the piece. It does keep shape and is sturdy, but I am disappointed with it scratching my ring."
3.0,"The color of this shoe is very nice. I get compliments when I wear them, but the toe box is short and shows some toe cleavage, which I don't like. I have other shoes from Qupid that don't do that, so not sure why these are different. Overall the design is cute and flirty."
3.0,"My wife asked me to pick these up for her, she has a large bust, and hasn't had a whole lot of luck getting a sports bra that provides the support she wants or the comfort. The AusFeLin bras are a bit too tight for her. We picked up her size, but she says they feel like a size too small."
3.0,Cheap. Ugly.
3.0,"Loved it after my first wear, now my butt basically peeks out the back because it shrank up so much after 1 wash/dry :("
3.0,is not the right  material for me
3.0,I liked the tree of life plugs but the Buddha ones I couldn’t see when in my ears.
3.0,"Pensé que como eran “térmicas” iban a ser calientes pero no, las use para andar en NYC y me fallaron."
3.0,"I bought this band thinking it would fit my 3157 SGW 100B. It did only PARTIALLY. The spring bars go through band and watch holes with no problem.  But metal brackets that hold spring bars to the band cannot be installed. so, I had to improvise! I simply used a metal to plastic glue to stick the spring bar to the Band. I don't need to remove the band until they break! The original Band for SGW 100B is $30 while a new watch is only $40. So, I am happy with this resin band."
3.0,Scratched very easy. And fogged up as well
3.0,The bottom barley cover the top of ur va jay jay make sure u wax! The top and the covering fit as expected the back of the bottom cause I had to go a size up would make an exposing crease  so crack was definitely showing
3.0,"Multiple uses, not just a neck gaiters, but a hood or hat if need be. Has a sinch to close or tighten, which is elastic. Nice and long so it will cover your neck in a variety of uses. Will not hold up to strong winds. Needs another layer of the same material."
3.0,DECAL STAMPED ON WAS A SURPRISE
3.0,Ok.  But quality was much less than expected.
3.0,The insulation was not real insulation... hard to fold back up.
3.0,Very cute but not accurate on sizing. Only complaint.
3.0,What a shame to hand knit with such inferior yarn.The knitting was fine but I doubt the material will last a winter.
3.0,"Very cheap materials, not what i would expect"
3.0,I like the material but it keeps sliding down.
3.0,"Great looking watch, but I've never seen worse instructions for setting the time, date, etc.  Instructions written by an Italian illiterate who doesn't understand English.  You have to be amazingly patient to set this thing, but once you get there you're ready for Rubic's Cube.  Just don't have to set it again six months later because you will have forgotten the algorithm and will be pulling your hair out again.  Other than that, it's terrific!"
3.0,"My daughter was very pleased. The only problem we that there was a big hole on the inside seam and we had to place a safety pin to close it. She discovered it as we were traveling. The problem was that part of the seam was never sewn. So I had to sew it up. However, that didn't stop her from wearing them."
3.0,sure wish they were wrinkle-free
3.0,I thought the watch band was a great buy. It’s beautiful but I’ve had it less than a month and the band is coming apart. It’s upsetting because it’s truly a beautiful watch band.
3.0,"This is extremely flimsy.  I would not get it for a small or rambunctious child.....but being an older cautious ""child"" myself,  :o)  I'll be careful with it.  I've only had it a day but it is currently keeping excellent time.  Has not lost maybe 3 seconds measured by my iPhone second hand.  The ""talking"" part is very irritating......I thought it might have 3 or 4 different ""sayings"" but they're all, maybe 3 or 4 adages all clumped together in a loooonng row with not good quality tone/sound and the button is way too quick & easy to ""turn on"" so I'm planning to open up the battery compartment and see if I can remove (hopefully) the one battery of four that operates the voice part.  I'm hoping that all four are not just linked to all of it....we'll see.  The lights are not what I anticipated either....but not a big issue.  It IS a nice looking watch that so far keeps good time......if I can add to thiis Review later, I'll post whether the voice part can be disabled.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Okay, I've had it for over a month now.....haven't broken it yet. :o) I opened the back and you can remove 3 of the four batteries....leave the lower left one installed to keep time....removing any or all of the other 3 disables the sucky voice sounds....sadly, it also disables the lights at the same time. Oh well. It is still keeping PERFECT time......but then, most quartz movements do, right? More recently, I've ordered the Masters watch.......should be here Monday. Check for my reviews of that......."
3.0,"Shipping was right on time, however the buckles are very cheaply made. The whistles all &#34;work&#34; but you have to move it around to find the right angle to make it work. The flint strikers did all seem to work though and all the buckles clip together well. I am disappointed in what I got but I guess for the price they're okay. 5 buckles for just over $2. I will be trying a different brand next time to have a comparison and I will probably spend a little more for hopefully a better product."
3.0,"love the color, love the material, love the stones. very true to picture what you saw is definitely what I got, was a bit worried about the quality of the fabric. but that was put to rest when I saw it. I usually wear a XL so I crossed my fingers wen I ordered that sixe bcause they didn't have it any bigger. but holy cow it is hugh. if I wasn't in Jamaica I would have returned it for a M. gonna had to take it to the seamstress. but besides that I love it.<br />size made me me give it 3 stars"
3.0,"Size Small felt like Large and it doesn’t fit right; color is off grey not as pictured, also fabric is a low quality."
3.0,They r light and cute. But letters already coming off after two days wearing. And i see half the price sw else.
3.0,Doesn’t hold its size after washing
3.0,The size is not accurate.  Sleeves are tight.  I haven't been able to wear it.
3.0,"I like that it looked exactly like the picture. Unfortunately I’m unable to see how it fits since I was Sent the incorrect size. Was looking forward to this cardigan look. But outside of that, it’s a nice taupe and olive color mixture, very light weight and soft."
3.0,Received on time. They seem a little large. I'm a 32a so I got the A cup double thickness. Hadn't had a chance to get them on right. When I do I will update my review and post pics.
3.0,Material is too thin but size is good.
3.0,"I have small hands and these are pretty snug on me. The touch screen does work, they are fine as they are but if I wash them I am not sure they will fit!"
3.0,These are good for yoga but NOT Pilates. The grip does not go all the way to the top of the toes so when your on the reformer it will not grip. Made it very hard to hold some poses.
3.0,I returned for a larger size since the color could show through if it's a little tight in the back...
3.0,Its just like the picture  but runs smaller  and really cheap  material
3.0,bought this for a trip to the beach and expected for them to last at least for 2 days but my hour 2 of being at the beach they were ruined! my child wasn't even in the water for long.
3.0,I love the fit but two pair have already broken and I'm really not that hard on sunglasses. With the price however I didn't expect a whole lot better. I'll probably order them again and if they break they break.
3.0,"I must be an odd shaped soul....5'4"" 160 lbs.....definitely have some lbs to lose...according to the measurements...got this in an xxl.... I usually wear a 6 to a 10 in pants depending on the brand, with 8 being my usual size, and I am a medium in tops......the top I was just able to painfully squeeze into but the skirt was huuuuuuge, like 2 of me could fit into that thing.  Since an xxl seems large for me, I got a similar one in plain xl.....no way I was squeezing into the xl top and while the xl skirt stayed up on it's own, it would easily fall down. To sum this up, i would probably need a large bottom and xxl top and I am not a chesty girl at all.....too bad u cant buy this on separate pieces (buy top and bottom separate would be ideal).  Nice colors and cute for masquerade party."
3.0,"Cute apron, light weight cotton, however, the ties in the back were not secure.  I wrapped it around to tie bow in the back around my waist and it came off.  Quick fix - a little black thread and a needle and I was back in business.  Worthy of 3 stars."
3.0,"I like this bag for its space. I can fit lots of my things in it. It’s pretty durable too and I’ve gotten compliments on it. The only downside was that it had a weird odor when I first opened it up. Maybe it’s the way it’s made which is what caused the smell? Something with the leather? I attempted to remove the odor with dryer sheets, but that ended up making it worse. So I just didn’t use the bag for months until the smell went away. I use it now, but if I had known how unpleasant that smell would’ve been, I probably would’ve just opted for another bag."
3.0,"First of all the material it's made from is good and my daughter said it's comfortable...but the snaps for the eye shield is not working well...well it's not snapping on at all. The entire reason for buying was because it's supposed to give that extra protection with the eye shield. My daughter won't wear the black one, because the eye shield not working. I've not tried the others yet."
3.0,It’s ok know the shoulders fit funny.
3.0,"The quality is good for the money, very warm, water proof.<br />Was not overly happy with the color as mine is much brighter green. It would be more suited to spring colors than fall."
3.0,colors on the one I received were not as pictured - the background is much lighter than it appeared.
3.0,"love the design, fabric. buy wayyy too small. i ordered an xl should have ordered a 3x"
3.0,"This shirt was not as long as I was expecting.  I'm tall, but I don't have a particularly long torso.  This thank definitely didn't cover much if any of my butt.  The fabric also had a strong chemical smell which I've never smelled with any of my organic cotton clothing.  Returned it."
3.0,"These mask are beautiful which caught my eye.  However, the material is not breathable.  I was disappointed."
3.0,"I have wide feet that swell, size 10 wide. My feet do not slide easily into this sandal. I gave it 3 stars because it is so cushy.... I hope that my feet stop swelling and I could wear this."
3.0,"I gave this blazer to an adult female friend for review. Her comments:<br /><br />I have mixed reviews for this blazer. The color is great and exactly what I expected (I ordered the coffee color), and the length of the coat and sleeves are nice, but I am having trouble with the overall fit. I am a true medium in size – pretty much straight through the torso with very little in the way of curves. Putting the jacket on, it feels tight across my shoulders but then it hangs down and looks too large across my body. I will only be able to wear it with a tank top or a very thin blouse in order for the shoulder area to fit comfortably, and even then, movement may be an issue. To be clear, I do not have broad shoulders and this is not typically a problem I have with clothing.<br /><br />The structure of the jacket is part of the problem. The fact that it is big across my body wouldn’t be a problem for casual wearing, but the jacket feels too structured and uncomfortable for casual wear. It lays somewhat stiffly on either side. On the other hand, it isn’t really suitable for work or business-like occasions because it hangs loosely and looks too sloppy. Buttoning it doesn’t help because when buttoned it just looks two sizes too big. Obviously, a smaller size wouldn’t fit across the shoulders at all.<br /><br />I can see wearing it belted and I think it will be nice for dressing up jeans, but overall, I don’t think I will get a lot of use from this blazer."
3.0,"I really want to love this shirt - the material quality is good, the pattern is excellent, it is comfortable and looks great - but only when you are standing still.  This shirt wants to roll up from the bottom.  it's not too tight - seems to fit well, but any movement and the hem starts rolling up.  This makes it impossible to do any exercise in and even wearing around the house means constantly rolling it back down."
3.0,Didn't work for me. I ordered an extra large and wouldn't go over my belly. Kind of cheap fabric too.
3.0,"It only occurred to me after I had completed the order that I wasn't required to state a size for this belt.  That could be said to be my fault, but I ended up with a 40&#34; belt instead of a 36&#34;.  Won't be able to use it much."
3.0,The belt clip is great and looks good. Unfortunately the belt leather is not a solid leather strap.  The result is that the teeth that clamp the latch to the belt regularly cut into the belt and eventually it tears the leather away at that spot. Not a lot but I tend to have to clip a small portion of the belt off every few weeks.  That being said I still like this belt
3.0,"This design is beautiful, however, the mask doesn't stay up and what's the point if you have to keep pulling the mask up. I can't do this myself, but will see if someone can add a bit of elastic to it, to help it stay in place."
3.0,It's a birthday present for my grand-neice and haven't given it to her yet.
3.0,These were tighter than I expected For the size I bought. They weren’t quite terrible but they def were tight and I had To do more jumping to get them on right. I dont Like having to jump to put on my leggings 😬
3.0,"It's too small my mom it's m, and we order L but it's small"
3.0,I have purchased other dresses from REPHYLLIS before and had great experiences so I decided to give this one a chance. This is not what I expected. The material was much thinner than my other ones and showed all the lumps/bumps (I do not like to wear slips under dresses- especially in the summer!). It was also very long on me (5'0 ft tall). I was looking forward to this dress but it definitely did not meet my expectations.
3.0,"This is a great purse for the price, lots of storage and stylish. But it's not perfect - it's not as structured as the pictures show and becomes floppy when not fully loaded. That makes the zippered pockets a little tough on mine to open one-handed. The side pocket zippers are slightly blocked by the metal loops for the shoulder strap, I find I have to regularly flip them out of the way to open them. Finally the shoulder strap seems useless - too thin and short to wear cross body for me at 6' tall and would probably be uncomfortable to use when purse is loaded.<br /><br />Update: I've been using it for about 4 days now and twice the inner lining on the front big external zip pocket has gotten stuck in the zipper and has been very inconvenient to fix and continue to use that pocket. For me that is a huge flaw because that pocket could be so much more useful."
3.0,Very cute but a couple of the horns came unattached from their headband before the 2 hour party was done.  Also the threading came off a few of the horns.
3.0,I dont like the quality
3.0,So my husband is a truck driver and got into some heavy fog. His watch filled with water so not happy about that.
3.0,Definitely not meant for 5’5” and 180 lbs. gave them to my daughter
3.0,"So these are VERY soft and they fit ok. Perhaps a tiny bit more snug than I expected.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The pants legs are not sewn. The hem is just cut. I will have to sew these myself to make it look better.<br /><br />Also, now I know why all the pictires in the ad show the waist rolled over. These pants are pretty high waisted. That's great if you want high waisted. But if you want these to stop below the belly button you will probably have to roll them too."
3.0,Fit good only down side had to get it replaced cause it started to tear after 2 use
3.0,A period piece that does not look too cheap.
3.0,These are really lovely but they're huge. Should have read the reviews before purchasing. Seriously they're very pretty but a bit much for everyday wear.
3.0,"i purchased these because my original knobs started peeling,the knobs are okay they are not of the same quality as the OEMs they fell cheaper but my son who uses the control more than i do to play plant vs zombies cant tell the difference, i have ad them on my controller longer than the originals and they haven't peeled"
3.0,"At least when I ordered this, this costume only came with the main body suit. I recommend that if you are tall, that you order a size up. The material itself is stretchy and comfortable. I was a bit bummed since it didn't come with all the accessories for the character."
3.0,"It fits my Fitbit, however, I don't remember there being a size choice. The band is too big for my wrist. I have it on the last holes and it's still loose and the ""tail"" is always popping out. The color is perfect 😊"
3.0,The material was uncomfortable
3.0,very thin. but very slip-resistant
3.0,The fit was a little small but still cute
3.0,I have to give this a three star rating since I ordered two necklaces and the star fish on one was missing pearls. It's very light weight (cheap) but you can't tell once its on. I couldn't have made it for the price. It is a little long on me so I plan on detaching the chain and attaching ribbon to hang it from my neck. It will be a fun piece of summer jewelry as I live on the Gulf Coast.
3.0,Loved the cross but lost a pearl in just a few days so haven't been able to wear it  since.
3.0,"I bought these to replace a similar pair I lost right before the cold weather hit here (high of 4 degrees on Friday).  I put them on right away to check the fit. I am quite petite with small hands but they were snug, so I flexed my hand to stretch them a bit.  To my surprise they immediately tore on the back of the hand!  I was indoors so it was not because it was cold.  I was quite disappointed. They do seem as though they will be as warm as the pair I lost, but if I didn't really need them right now I'd return them."
3.0,Had to return it.  Felt flimsy and my passport was loose. Not functional
3.0,Arms run small
3.0,Did not like the material. I feel like it could tear at any moment. Interesting cut though.
3.0,"I am going to start by saying, I love this key chain. But, the picture is deceiving as well as the description. It looks like I should receive 2 of these as it shows 2 in the picture and says 2pcs. I only received 1. So that was disappointing."
3.0,"This is a super cute idea and product. I loved it. My boyfriends' had broken and we couldn't use the extra string they give because we were at the store and they went everywhere. In the beginning, they were always pinching our skin and arm hair and it hurt a lot, but I have now worn mine for about a month or two and it no longer hurts."
3.0,"The dress is very pretty but it’s so see through! I’ll only be wearing it over swimwear, which is not what I intended it for, but the fit is accurate, and the print is pretty. It’s not quite as vibrantly colored as the photo makes it seem."
3.0,The sleeves are too big and not fitted like shown in the picture.
3.0,"First things first: I hate the banding around the bottom of the top, it makes it so that you can’t move/it’s way too tight. It’s very restricting. Also, because of the photograph I expected the pajama top to be a bit more like tunic length, and it is not at all. It is kind of just at my bellybutton. Also, compared to the bottoms, the top is quite small in size and the bottoms were quite large. These PJs, as cute as they are, were sort of all over the place for me. Expected a lot more from than what I got after reading all the reviews."
3.0,This top looks much better on the model.  It runs very large and the material is rather cheap feeling.
3.0,Had to send it back for a larger size. Then when I got it wasn’t totally please gave me a nice waste line but smooshed my boobs
3.0,Stone color is off.  I wish it was the same color as the picture.
3.0,Good aspects...very light and warm..bad...shrank and drafty neck.
3.0,"Fit more like a 2XL when it clearly says 4XL. Was planning on giving it as a gift, but kept for myself because it was extremely small."
3.0,Stickers for players starting with A thru C were missing
3.0,I ordered a lot of these but the pink one from this seller is not as well made as my others. the materials are thinner and it is not as strong a clip. while the other colors from another seller are just as pretty I cant say it tops the favorites list like my other clips. if I could go back id make sure I got the pink from the same manufacturer.
3.0,"I like the look of this item. I have small wrists and the firm silver part is almost wider then my wrist, looks a little big for me."
3.0,Nice for price. Dollars have to be folded to fit. Change part is small. Wrist part is strong. Soft faux leather.
3.0,"It's pretty and as pictured, but the chain feels like plastic not metal."
3.0,Ordered for my wife and it fit ok but after a while it's coming apart .
3.0,"It's cute, but not a great fit.  The hat is WAY too tight!  I don't have a big head, and it's unwearable.  I can force it on, but it's so tight that I can't even raise my eyebrows.  LOL.  The calf cuffs are for wrists!  They don't even come close to closing around my calves.  Useless because the jacket already has white cuffs on it.  The jacket will not stay velcro'ed closed.  It's just not strong enough velcro.  I'd have to pin it to keep it secure. The pants fit fine.  I have a 2nd santa outfit on order and I'm most likely going to return this one unless I'm desperate."
3.0,i like them very much but they have small scratches. Someone else might not see them because they are small in my ears but once you take a closer look you can tell they are scratched.
3.0,Its very costume looking👎Chain is nice tho👍
3.0,Fits like a maternity tunic. Ordered a Small and it is still very big and shapeless.
3.0,Awkward fit. Had to return it.
3.0,"Look nice, scuff super easily, kid didn't like wearing them at all."
3.0,"A little bit small. Button part of the thread is a lot of, wearing sleep is not very comfortable. But the material is comfortable to touch."
3.0,Not a bad shirt but not as cute as the pictures. Bra doesn’t give much support so I don’t think I’ll be using this for regular workouts but will try to for yoga. I’m 5’4 and feel like this would have been a much better fit on someone taller as the chest/shoulder area is long.
3.0,"I needed a long  jacket like this for coverage after the gym... after reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance on it.  I loved the fabric , the length, and the fact that there was some extra room at the bottom of the zipper.  However, the sleeves were at least 6 inches too long and the were way too tight.  The other reviewers stated this jacket was close fitting, and they are not exaggerating.. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear, and it still fit like a second skin, highlighted areas I wanted to minimize .  I will return it."
3.0,"WARNING: this is juniors size, if you're taller than about 5'4&#34; this will not fit in the sleeves. KINDA cheaply made. I ordered the 2X, i'm 200 lbs, 5'7&#34;, large bust, it was way too small. It runs way small."
3.0,"I ordered this dress looking for a modest option for an upcoming wedding. The fabric and lace were very pretty, but I was unable to wear the dress due to a very open back and small arm holes."
3.0,"Bought this back in february 2017 and it was awesome wallet till it broke around January 2018, was going to re buy one but seen the price went up from $19.99 to $50 so not sure i would pay that much for it to not last over a year."
3.0,Fit to small and it was a large
3.0,"Of course, it’s starting to turn to spring and then summer weather, so I am always on the lookout for capris and other clothes meant for warmer weather. Most of my workout or relax bottoms are pants, so I was glad to see these and decided to pick them up and give them a try. I was pretty bummed that they didn’t have either grey or the black available in my size (and they still don’t), so I went with red. It’s just a bummer because it won’t match as well, but when I am at home I don’t care as much.<br /><br />Even though I usually wear a little bigger size, these actually fit in most areas. Except the waist. Because of that they don’t stay up very well and I had to keep adjusting them. They weren’t hanging off of me, so going down a size wouldn’t help, but they are not a firm fit. If I wore them with the roll over waist, they still wouldn’t fit and then parts of me I don’t want hanging out would be hanging out.<br /><br />It’s definitely thinner material than it looks in the picture and I could see it wearing out really fast. It’s not see through, even when stretched, though, so it’s not horribly thin.<br /><br />I’m really kind of meh about these pants. I wanted to like them more than I did, but they aren’t a horrible mess. The stitching looks good, but that’s about the only positive thing I can find to say about them.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discount in return for an honest review."
3.0,Ordered two bags.. this color did not come with a zipper top.
3.0,"Although this shawl is very soft, the actual colors are green/blue/grey. No black and white to be found. The pattern is nice and it's a good price, but the colors are not what I was expecting based on the photos and the description ""black white."""
3.0,Nice shoes but had to return them because they were way smaller than advertised.
3.0,"Normally wear a 2XL or 3XL, got the 3X and it does not fit at all true to size. I used the sizing chart provided, but I was busting out like a can of rolls and couldn't zip it. Never had much luck with returns, so guess I'll try letting it out or hit the gym before I can wear it out."
3.0,"Fairly decent pair of board shorts. Quality is ok, especially for the price. Does come with the inner mesh liner like swim trunks - I cut mine out. The only strange negative is that the drawstring isn't anchored to anything - if you untie it, it can come completely off the shorts."
3.0,darker blue than expected. very flowy. made well.
3.0,Missing a couple of the rhinestones out of the anchor. But it's still cute and functional
3.0,"I think this dress would be adorable in other colors as the white is extremely and totally see through. My husband thought it looked a little like a mumu nightgown, but I think with a belt it would have given the dress less of a bulky look. Cute for the price and for a super casual look. I returned the white because of it being so see through."
3.0,too big arnd the armpit area. no inner skort but does have side pockets. back lace is pretty
3.0,"I will start by saying these belts (I bought two) are WAY smaller than advertised. The belit lists as being 43” long but in actuality are 36” long - I actually measured. That’s the difference between fitting and not fitting. I had to give them to my son. The belts are very good quality from the cloth belt to the buckle.  If it were possible, think of them as a dressier cloth belt - not casual. More sturdy than soft.  I would have given 4.5 stars but the sizing was WAY OFF, so 3 stars."
3.0,"They are ok no stretch at all, fits kindve snug"
3.0,not as fluffy as expected
3.0,These underwear are cute but ride up pretty high in the back. Can easily show if you wear low rise pants (also some mid rise ones too). Comfy but not super functional.
3.0,"Should have returned this but just wound up donating it unworn. Looked cute online,  but poor quality."
3.0,La pulsera es muy corta
3.0,"They are nice to keep the sun off,  but I feel hotter when I wear them."
3.0,Very cute for the price.. Expected to shrink after the first wash so order one size bigger... Try it with a tie around black belt...
3.0,I bought this dress with high hopes and the dress was really nice. The fabric was thick and the quality seemed good. One of the buttons was higher than the other so that would have had to be fixed but I returned it because it was just too bulky in the front. I'm tall and rather busty and it didn't look good at all on me. The belt was just below my bust line because I have a long torso so it just didn't work for me. Had it fit a little differently I would have kept it because I  think it's adorable.
3.0,I'm good just hope when I wash them they will skrink I'm not complaining.
3.0,so-so....
3.0,"Fit as expected, looked like a dress that Duggar lady with 40 kids would wear."
3.0,"Wife likes it, although it doesn't fit very well."
3.0,"sunglasses came with a crack in the lens but other than that the style is great and the frame is sturdy, I'm sure my problem happened in shipping"
3.0,"The pants themselves are great! They are exactly what I needed. I suffer from MS and the additional pockets allow me to store ice packets to help keep me cool. They look professional and are very comfortable. I gave it three stars because my current pair (worn 3 times) the zipper is separating at the seam causing an ever increasing hole. Returning product and ordering it again. We will see how it turns out.<br />Also wish it had an elastic component to the material to allow for more movement but like I said, I love these pants."
3.0,"It does the job if you’re okay with it being not great quality. The fabric is fairly thin, the hood is unusually small, and the pocket seam was done with black thread. I got an XL and it fit pretty close to a L. Overall it was an okay product."
3.0,"I received these for Christmas. They are soft. The issue is that in order to keep them in the package they put 3....count them...3...plastic wire pieces through them with tabs on each side and the wire piece was pulled so tight that even if I cut the tabs carefully and I did, the outer two pairs of socks had snags in them. The could have put them in a plastic bag. The knit is soft, but fragile and just pulling the wire through. .3 of them, snagged them. You can't mend them, so I basically got 4 pairs."
3.0,"I expected the bracelets to be a bright white...they look more off white. Not like the picture, that's for sure."
3.0,"Material is nice & soft, fits nicely.  I ordered the pink, I was expecting the pink in the photo, but the pink I received was much darker & brighter... not what I was going for."
3.0,Bought the largest size for my very thin 12yo. It is much too small. Will save for his little sisters. Its very soft and the design is bright.
3.0,Fit is a little different than on model.
3.0,"I'm glad I paid no more than I did, because, with Christmas sales, there are many purses out there in this price range that are easy competition for this one. The pattern I chose (multi-colored) is cute, though, and I think it may make some teen smile. The &#34;drawstring&#34; is stiff, so I hope it does &#34;break in&#34; somewhat. There is a little coin purse inside... not a little plastic-looking one, but it does seem to match the blue in the pattern. There are no pockets...when the drawstrings are let out, it's a two-sided, flat pouch. The straps are adjustable, and the purse is not large... seems &#34;teen&#34; size to me."
3.0,Ears didn't stand up as well as picture shows but overall a cute hat. Was a little tight for on my 12 month old.
3.0,"Me agrado el producto,  pero  no tanto la calidad del bro he."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this bag, and there were some things I did like about it -- it fits into a gym locker quite well, and I liked the backpack-style straps. But in the end, I stopped using it and bought another of the type of bag I had been using before. I didn't like the way the flap folds down -- sometimes I'd forget to close the zipper pocket in the flap and everything in it would fall out when I opened the bag; plus, the strap to roll up the flap when the bag is open was fairly useless if there was anything in that pocket. The &#34;shelves&#34; inside the bag bent under the weight of my stuff, and the snaps that secure them to the sides kept coming undone. There aren't enough small pockets for little things like a brush, comb, bottles of shampoo/lotion, etc. And since it doesn't have hard sides, the bag would fold or flop over over when placed on the floor. I used it for a couple of months before I lost patience and gave up."
3.0,Makes my bald head sweat
3.0,"Very cute suit. The quality is not the best - the back strap got a hole in it after wearing it once. The bottoms cover my postpartum belly pretty well, but not my butt. The top has no support but stays on well. Overall I do like it though!"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:707c29427ca627bd177f1094d9742e06]] Carbon fiber faceplate was warped upon removing it from the package and actually placing it on the wallet itself it was a pain to get on. Also the holes bored out for the screws on both the carbon fiber faceplates looked rough and half-assed done. Could have been polished more, and definitely not warped. Let’s see how well the lifetime warranty holds up."
3.0,"I loved these, but sadly one of the posts broke and they didn't have any in my size to replace them.  They are worth replacing!  So pretty and fun."
3.0,"These shirts fit snug in the shoulders, but have enough flex not to limit mobility. They are mesh, but not see-through. They wick sweat pretty well. They had little 1-2” tears or slits in several spots on each shirt, on the front and back of the torso portion. They’re workout shirts, so that doesn’t bother me immensely. But they’re in the “get what you pay for” category in my opinion. I’ll spend a few bucks more next time."
3.0,"Larger than expected, but decent quality material. I would buy again a size down."
3.0,The skirt runs big and isnt flattering for girls with wider hips like me
3.0,Pad is generous very Good for indoor gym. Not so good for outside
3.0,This shirt is cute but the first button and string was different than the others. I think I had a defective one.
3.0,"Cute hat, but it came in one size which was a bit too small for me."
3.0,Bracelet is too big
3.0,"I don't think this works with all body types.  I tend to be apple shaped--like an apple with skinny arms and legs attached, so this very puffy and shapeless blouse did NOTHING but accent that.  I think this might work on some better proportioned plus size women, maybe.  But it really seems made for the truly skinny person who can wear a potato sack and look good.<br /><br />That being said, I like the material--kind of parachute/taffeta material, very light and comfortable.  It does want to pup up onto the shoulders a bit, but not as bad as some shirts I've had.  That alone wouldn't stop me from wearing it--it wasn't that bad.<br /><br />But I can't stand the &#34;ball-shaped puff&#34; that it creates on my body."
3.0,I bought this for my cousin she loved it then it  broke on her :/ disappointing don't get me wrong tho the bracelet was really cute but she wore it for 5 minutes and it fell apart
3.0,"I saw the picture of this ear cuff and immediately know that I need a pair in my life.  The wings and the dangling ear drops looks very beautiful.  When it arrived, it looked exactly like the picture but it is bigger than I expected.  However the cuff on both wings were squooshed together.  It was a bit hard to bend it back to it’s original shape. I was scared that if I bend too much it would  break and if I did not bend enough it wouldn't be strong enough when putting it on my earlobe.  Unfortunately after few tries the hoop cuffs broke off and I was not able to fix it.  While I did like the way the product looked on me, but unfortunately it broke shortly after.  Very disappointed."
3.0,"The romper is well stitched with snap buttons along the legs for easy diaper change. The fabric is soft, stretchy and breathable, lightweight. I would have given it 5 stars had it not come damaged. The front design in places is either not painted well or scratched off or melted or something of the sort. This is intended as a gift and it does not look good. I am very upset."
3.0,I loved the style and it was very flattering. I just couldn’t get over the cheap looking fabric on the top section. It looked fine from a distance but up close it just didn’t look nice. A bit bummed as otherwise I would have loved it. I’m 5’ and 135 lbs. I’m almost always a size 6 in this brand.
3.0,"Nice material, but a bit small."
3.0,"They are very pretty and seem to be of good quality, but the pair I got are actually hearts, not pear shaped like the picture and description say. I'm kind of disappointed that they're not as described and am seriously considering sending them back."
3.0,"Pros: Fit was good. Length was good, not too short like other brands, I'm 5'6&#34;.<br />Cons: Belt loops are very small and the fabric started piling after about 3 months of weekly washing and wearing."
3.0,Stretches out really easily - doesn’t hold size well
3.0,I like the looks of the product and the quality.  The opening at the top is too small to insert books for my use.
3.0,"In all fairness, my husband doesn't generally like skinny fit jeans.  We thought with the word ""stretch"" in the description they would fit better.  No.  He wears between a 32-34 waist and is very slender in the legs.  These almost looked like tights on him.  Way to snug.  The waist was fine.  The color and workmanship was good.  The price is reasonable.  They are just uncomfortable for him and they look it.  Maybe for a much younger man they would be perfect."
3.0,I bought these thinking I could use the touch screen feature. This doesn't really work and some of the decorative balls fell off the first I wore them.
3.0,It’s a cute dress but it’s small then the size measurements say
3.0,Update: After a few months of wearing it about 2 stones fell out.<br /><br />I got this ring only a few days ago and it is already my favorite ring.  It is very colorful and catches the light really well to add a bit of sparkel.  It has flat sides so you can stack rings together.
3.0,But the color is dark which is I don’t like it .. it is not as pictures
3.0,"My daughter loves this shirt, however it runs small. If you are a medium order at least a large."
3.0,"Really like shirt , but gotta order up. I’m 5 10 n 200 n I got xxl m it’s just fits. Worried about the dyer"
3.0,"The wallet is nice. No zipper issues like others have complained about, it moves nice and smooth.  It does have a little bit of a chemical smell but not overwhelming.  This is a good wallet for the price."
3.0,Sizes would probably fit kids.
3.0,Nice quality for the price. The only thing is that the color is definitely not red but maroon.
3.0,Not a lot of room for my whoha if you know what I mean
3.0,"Just ok,  was not a big fan of this scarf"
3.0,"Very thin material, material isn't too shift in my opinion but overall okay product"
3.0,It seems to be a nice watch but I only give it 3 stars because it is listed Boys Girls and it is the size of a full size men's watch.  The band does adjust down just enough to fit my 8 1/2 year old.  He has worn it twice...
3.0,"Not what I expected, doesn’t fit snug"
3.0,I am a D cup and it doesn't really fit but they do hold up.
3.0,I recommend sizing up because the skirt does run really small. Best part was the pockets it's kinda hard to find skirts with pockets so I recommend.
3.0,Super cute dress. Fabric is just printed polyester but still looks great. My only complaint is that the sleeves are sewn in a weird way that makes them feel like they are twisted. Im most likely going to remove them and sew them back on correctly.
3.0,Appears as pictured but the fit is larger than expected and offers nothing in the way of support. I wouldn't purchase again.
3.0,"the first time i ordered it it was wayyy too small, sized up twice and was still too small<br />comfort was really good tho"
3.0,They are good. Some lights didn't work.
3.0,Cheap. But not expensive so there ya go.
3.0,Sent back too short
3.0,"It has a relaxed fit , good as the picture however the olive colour in the picture is brown in real so a bit disappointed."
3.0,It took all my energy to get it on one leg. I was so exhausted after. If you're suffering from pain in your wrist or don't intend to put up a fight keep it moving. Material is too stiff....
3.0,"kinda works, uncomfortable around ears."
3.0,I would have given this a better rating but there was a flaw in the fabric.  It looked like the fabric had a wrinkle in it when the image was prinited leaving a 3&#34; x 1/8&#34; white line.  It was a birthday gift and I did not have time to return it so I filled in the white line with a red marker.  My grandson didn't notice but I feel it shoulld have been caught by the manufacturer.
3.0,I ordered this and was just about a size too small. I would definitely recommend sizing up. It is super cut and looks like the picture though!
3.0,I don't like the chain to loose not stable ....
3.0,"These are very pretty, but way too heavy unfortunately. They were pulling on my earlobes and stretched them down. Returning"
3.0,It was advertised 7-15 day delivery. Took over a month to arrive. Very small and doesn't stretch much.  I had to buy a mask from someone else and it arrived two weeks before this one.
3.0,UPDATE.<br />The item was replaced and all the parts were there.<br /><br />It is way cute but cheaply made. Hope it works.
3.0,I love the feel of this shirt. I just wish the sleeves weren't so tight!!
3.0,The lenses are not near as good as Oakley. For the price they are ok.
3.0,"The top is great, but the bottoms were way too small."
3.0,"I like the dress a lot. But the dart/pleat in the back of the dress makes it unwearable. Other than THAT catastrophe, I am going to take it to my seamstress and see if she can do something. Otherwise it's a waste."
3.0,One of the earrings was broke.
3.0,My husband did not like the way this sweater felt on. Would not buy again.
3.0,"This was a gift, and the person I gave it to did not tell me until recently that it did not fit correctly. It did not fit him correctly in the torso and it was not long enough."
3.0,"Very pretty, just bigger than I expected."
3.0,Great jersey; materal & quality were exactly as expected. However it was just way too small.
3.0,"These are super cute, but unfortunately very easily scratched and scuffed up:("
3.0,Purchased for my child and I wore a couple. They are really cute. A tad flimsy but that was to be expected.
3.0,Love the colors and the ombré style of this sweat shirt.  The fabric is soft but thin. Fits as expected.
3.0,"These necklaces are adorable but are not &#34;one size fits all&#34; by any means. Also, 2 of them have broken already, and all I was doing was putting them on. They might not last too long, but for the price and the cute-ness of them - they are pretty good!"
3.0,It was to small and fragile hard to notice.
3.0,"Had to return. No matter how tightly I secured the earring, they continued to droop sideways."
3.0,"Ordered 4 bracelets for gifts to give girlfriends. Only one of the four had the pretty multi-color, the other three were more clear colored, with some yellow. I would not have ordered if I realized that the four would not have matched, however the girlfriends did like the bracelets. It's a bit difficult to tighten and loosen the bracelet, it doesn't move smoothly so it feels like it might break when tugging to get it loose or tight. I also misordered one of the bracelets as I didn't realize that it was a ""necklace"", so pay attention when ordering because the main description shows ""bracelet"" although when you click on the specific item there is a ""necklace"" snuck in there. I was going to keep the necklace, however the crystal does not lay flat on the chest so it is always in an awkward position....returning the necklace."
3.0,"I liked these pants when I bought them but over time the seams have twisted so that the side seams are cutting across the front. Looks terrible and feels awkward. Hand wash/reshape & hang dry might stop this from happening. They are quite thin but made from bamboo and that works well for someone who has problems with overheating. I originally bought a large based on size chart, however, when the medium arrived it fit me best. For the record, I'm 5.5, weigh 143 and my waist is 33""-34"", w/hips 37"".  They do tend to get ""grease"" spots that are hard to get out. I use a tiny bit of Dawn dtgt. And it helps.  These are so comfy that I wear them for lounge, pjs and even outside. Bamboo helps cool."
3.0,"Buttons do not hold mask in place , can only use as hat not mask holder, that is why only 3 stars. not what I bought them for."
3.0,"A little tight for my average wrist. otherwise, cute!"
3.0,Not as large as expected. It says it can  hold 4-6 ties but even 4 is pushing it.
3.0,surprised how small and fine it is<br />looks frail<br />afraid to put much weight on it<br />if you want a very fine chain = perfect
3.0,"Cute but was not made well. The collar was not lined up with the other side of the dress so it just looked odd since the rest of the collar was white and one side was partially black. This flaw stuck out like a sore thumb. Cute overall design and very comfortable to wear, just bad workmanship. Too bad!"
3.0,My son said the sound quality is not the greatest.
3.0,Looks good fits great.
3.0,The sweater is soft and beautiful but sheds horribly. It shedded all over my new leggings. Not happy.
3.0,"I bought this dress for my 8 year-old daughter to wear as the flower girl in a wedding. She is a true size 8 and this dress is just a tab bit snug, although, the back bodice is adjustable (which helps a little). With just a little bit of attention, this dress could be a homerun. But, it is very sparce with the tulle on the bottom. The belt completely rides up, so we had to do some alterations by sewing the top of the belt onto the bodice and hot glue the bottom of the belt onto the tulle. Frustrating, but, it had to be done. There is a very thin slip underneath the tulle to prevent that itchy feeling. The back criss-cross ties and it is just wonky. There is no way to make it look polished or nice, it just is what it is. The back (bodice) ribbon tie and the belt ribbon are a slightly different shade, but not really enough to hate. But, what bugs me the most is that they intersect and look odd. The 2 bows tie at the exact same spot in the back. Odd. We decided to use the little pin/clip on the belt (which detaches to become a hair clip or can be used as a pin) in her hair. For the price, it will definitely do, but, with just a couple simple fixes this could be a knockout dress!!"
3.0,My son likes it. Very comfortable... However I feel for the money that was spent. It should have came with a complete bedding sheet set and not just a comforter.
3.0,Ok runs a bit small
3.0,I bought these as a gift. They are super soft and comfortable according to my husband but they faded quickly. After about 2 washes they looked like they were several years old due to the fading.
3.0,Great for mix n match for the child who always wants something different. Not so comfortable to actually wear for an extended time.
3.0,"Not as Covid protective as desired, yet a nice look and good for what it is likely made for. Our other mask is easier to breathe with, yet this is good to cover neck and head, especially Covid hair : )"
3.0,The material is a bit cheap.
3.0,"Beautiful skirt and material, i wear a medium and i ordered XL..... Skirt part was great, waste band was torture. The waste was for someone who wears a small."
3.0,"Very snug on the tummy. Definitely what I’d call appetite control pants.<br /><br />I don’t really understand the point of pockets because these are leggings... be sure to wear long shirt or dress. Do not be fooled...<br /><br />I do really like the thickness of the pants, though. And they are smoothing and better looking than leggings. But do not expect to wear them like pants."
3.0,"I had to use extreme force to snap the straps onto the headset.  And when I got them on, I was not confident they would hold because they did not seem to be all the way on.  They did not fall off with a few days of testing.<br /><br />This headset is more comfortable then what came with the Quest 2.  But I also tried one that was twice the cost of this one and it was way better and did not have the issue with installation.<br /><br />I guess if you can't afford twice as much, this one is still much better than original head strap.<br />I took off two stars as I thought I was going to break my headset trying to put these straps on.<br />It would not be fair to take off any stars because it is not as comfortable as one that cost twice as much."
3.0,It's not true ro size. I can live with it but no room left!
3.0,Just looks like it would be looser. I was really looking forward to this shirt. It is was so very cute.
3.0,"Arrived late, runs small, poor construction"
3.0,"These were very cute, but sized WAY too small!!"
3.0,Very long tail and my wife had to take it to the tailor for chest and length adjustment but good for the price
3.0,Not the quality I expected for the price.
3.0,"I ordered the gold version of these and was quite excited because they look hipster and cool. I was very disappointed when I tried them on and realized that the frames are abnormally large. I read a different review before ordering and discounted it, but unfortunately these glasses will make you kind of look like a beetle if you have a normal face size. I did not read the measurements before ordering, so that might just be my mistake. They look cool and seem to be good quality, so make sure they're the size you want before ordering! I personally did not like them though."
3.0,"The masks are polyester and not cotton. Which makes breathing in them not easy. They are lightweight but, with the material, it’s a moot point. And there wasn’t any indication that they weren’t cotton."
3.0,"It's an okay tank for running.  I like my UnderArmour Twist Tanks better.  This one was not quite as cute in person, but not worth the hassle to return."
3.0,I thought these earrings were going to be one of my favorite to wear and yet I've worn them twice and they don't sparkle like I thought Austrian crystal would. Love the blue sapphire color though.
3.0,This is an okay sweatshirt. It is kind of stiff when you get it. I have tried washing it to help make it less stiff and it seemed to help a little bit. The bottom of the sweatshirt is a little tight at the waste. It looks good but isn't the most comfortable sweatshirt. I would not describe it as soft and cozy.
3.0,"The pattern of this dress is pretty and the fit is as expected. What I did not love is the fabric. It is actually thinner than I expected and makes the dress not very flattering on my body type. I returned it, but it might work better on others. I can usually feel good in a sheath dress if the fabric is thicker, so the thin fabric might still work well on people who are really skinny!"
3.0,It's ok. The seams on inside show if you lift your arms. But ok.
3.0,"I purchased the white/gray/black camo print in size small (I'm 6'2"", 29"" waist with bigger/muscular legs) and the material is sheer enough that I can see my leg hair through the pants.<br /><br />Also the 'stretchabilty' is disappointing, the feel around my thighs and glutes is that of a cotton t-shirt stretched to its limits and about to tear. My disappointment in leg length is doubled by the poor range of elasticity.<br /><br />Stitching and build quality are better than I expected for the price point based on initial washes and a couple of wearings (for spinning/weight lifting).<br /><br />Bought a pair of DRSKIN brand compression pants at the same time and I can't recommend one over the other at this point (not thrilled with either pair)."
3.0,really nice glasses
3.0,I love everything about this top except the bottom front - it tends to bulge out strangely even when tucked in
3.0,THEY TEND TO RUN NARROW AND RUB ON THE LITTLE TOE.  CUTE THOUGH!
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but fit is a little small. I'm small/medium, 130lbs, 64&#34; tall. I'm not long waisted, but the waist line on this dress hit me more at my rib cage height than my waist. Length was perfect and it is a really pretty dress, just didn't fit like the picture suggested where the waist line hem was truly around the waist.  If wearing with bare legs, the embroidery is pretty itchy, and I would guess that after a full day at work would be irritating to the skin. I'm returning this item."
3.0,"Very light weight and comfortable BUT has a very bad glare, a blue glare, I’ll be returning because of this. I wore them for one day and found myself continually trying to clean the lens, the glare is that bad."
3.0,"My girl is 9 and is a cross-country runner. She loves the previous version of this shoe, the one WITHOUT the elastic adjustable closure. She does NOT like this new model because she cannot use it for running. when she tries to secure her foot, the elastic closure extends too far beyond the Velcro support underneath. The two faces of the Velcro do not connect! I am surprised that Under Armour made the mistake of replacing the non-stretchable closure with an elastic one."
3.0,Dress has navy in it. The stripes should have been Navy. They are black. It’s noticeable in sunlight.
3.0,"Small to size, great linen fabric"
3.0,Don't love the material or fit. Just ok.
3.0,"Love the shirt, but it is way too big. Need to return it. There was a description that led me to believe it was a misses size not a regular man's size."
3.0,Took 6 weeks to arrive. Not at all as pictured.
3.0,"Too small, even at the largest size. Definitely for teens."
3.0,"Very small, but will keep and give it to a child for a gift later on."
3.0,"I got this in place of a mask as a face covering. Bad choice. It is way too thin to accomplish anything and is really tight against my nose. It may be good for other things, but don't get this as a face covering for COVID"
3.0,It is a cute idea but did not whole up seem to disolve to easy was a gift person did not like
3.0,Keep falling off.
3.0,Good quality fabric. Nice cut. Fits a little on the larger side.
3.0,"I wish it had pockets, a longer belt or Velcro to close."
3.0,Nice color but a little bit heavy.<br />Not real easy to put on.<br />I do like them .very unique.
3.0,Not bad for the price. I have would have given 4 stars but the purse smells so bad. Kind of like a cigarette and fishy smell mixed together. I am really hoping the smell fades by the time I need to use it
3.0,"I bought a large due to what I read about the arm cuffs, and they were still cutting off the circulation in my arms.  The rest of the dress was a bit too big, as my regular size is medium.  Beautiful dress, just wish they made the arm cuffs more stretchy to fit people who have any muscle whatsoever in their arms.  I had to return it."
3.0,"Fits a little loose (at least with hair loss). But it is pretty. Very comfortable, but not cotton and it says in the description. So it might be a little hotter than a cotton scarf. Overall it is a decent scarf for the price"
3.0,You get what you pay for with these sunglasses
3.0,Zippers broke. Finger touch isn’t great. Cuts wind pretty well. Keeps hands warm.
3.0,"Kids loved these. They are a bit shorter than expected but not too much. The print is good and held up to the first wash ok. The elastic is the main downfall, they don't stay up well."
3.0,At first it was good but it didn't last that long..it fell apart but I guess it depends on how u use it but I bought it for my 13 yr old son
3.0,"I liked the styling and color, but the fabric is cheap and the jacket is not well constructed. For example. the extra fabric on the inside of the front flaps out because it is not sewn into place. The best thing I can say about the fabric is that it has some stretch, which makes it a little more comfortable."
3.0,Didn't fit to my liking
3.0,They prongs are not put in the middle of the earrings and they are not mirror images so they don’t appear the same when in ears
3.0,These are not sleek and fitted but rather boxy in the fingers - I did not care for - they were soft and warm tho
3.0,I received three different sized in this pack of three. Tanks are cool but sizes are all over
3.0,"Dirty/dusty/potentially used but definitely worth the price. Perfect for this gala I'm going to, won't need to worry about it getting dirty because it already is!<br /><br />Don't buy if planning to use for your wedding or something."
3.0,I was ready to return these kind of thinking why did I even bother but to my surprise they fit perfectly and as described. Kind of cheaply made but just fine to wear a couple times or if u are looking to save money
3.0,My husband liked it but it was small
3.0,Loved the fit hated the snaps and pockets!
3.0,Very see through....cheap made
3.0,Not cotton at all but overall nice
3.0,Disappointed with the material. Will serve the purpose.
3.0,"These are not high waisted paints. I have an apple bottom, and the pants slide down when I move around. I got an L & should have got an XL. I’m 5,6 200 lbs. also the design bands around the legs so it’s a tighter fit there. It’s cuter in pic than in person in my opinion. I can’t work out in this, but I can wear for leisure. No issue with the sport bra part & I’m a 36 D."
3.0,Shirt was too small and very thin material. Not what I expected.
3.0,"I was so very excited when my shoes came in, only to discover they were too small. I normally wear a 7-7.5, I went with a 7.5 to be safe only to discover they still didn't fit :( they are super cute though and I will be returning for a bigger size once I figure out how considering there was no packaging slip or return label present when I opened the bag."
3.0,"If your a lady with a bigger tushy, this is NOT SQUAT proof. They are very comfy, wash well and look good on.  Just don’t wear a thong at the gym and your good."
3.0,"not great for when wearing any bra, the shirt comes up over the bottom of all my bras, and im an A cup, but otherwise great material and besides constant adjustments to cover my bra, super cute"
3.0,"I am 5'3"", 135 lbs., average build. The waist band was tight and the elastic started rolling as I was trying them on. It was so difficult to straighten the elastic out, that I didn't even bother trying on the second pair. The material was decent, the length was shorter than I expected. I returned them, spent a bit more money purchasing a pair of linen blend pants from another seller on Amazon, better quality and fit."
3.0,"This dress fits well and is comfortable, however, the pockets pooch out on big hips.  The reason I would not buy this again is that it pilled up and looked awful after just one wash (front load, gentle cycle).  It looks like it’s 5 years old and it’s been worn twice and washed once.  It’s just a dress for at home only, like a night gown, now."
3.0,Order 2 to 3 sizes up
3.0,Odd fit around the neckline. Flares out giving it a weird look on the shoulders. Runs just a bit small. Returned it because of the weird fit around the neckline.
3.0,"The cosplay itself is pretty well made. Materials are pretty standard for retail cosplays. Some parts are made pretty cheaply but are easily customizable. The only issue I had was the proportions. The shirt was way too short and I had to get a different one, and the coat is super long. I’m pretty short and heavy set so I got a bigger size, and I expected some components to be really long but everything fit fine except the length of the coat which was long but not a problem. The shirt on the other hand looked like a crop-top."
3.0,"I ordered the shirts for my step daughter but they were too big on her. It says for girls, so I ordered a medium.... now I am wearing the shirts and they're pretty itchy. Not a fan!"
3.0,"The soft silicone of this band feels much nicer than the Samsung band that comes with the Gear S2.  It snapped into place the same as the Samsung band making for an easy installation.  However, the band will not remove.  Pressing the tabs and pulling upward as the Gear instructions state is not working in this bands case.  If anyone else has had this issue and has suggestions for removing the band, please comment."
3.0,I see this item is not available anymore on Amazon.  This was a quite large container for a Palm and some other objects.  I frankly ended up not using it much as it was just so large.  I suppose it would make some sense if you had another thing like a briefcase or purse to put it in.
3.0,"Once I get it on, it looks great.  They did not built ANY wiggle room into the top seam, which has to go over the widest part of the body.  I'm disappointed in the stretch.  I'm not huge, but my thighs and hips are bigger than my ribs and so a swimsuit should stretch more."
3.0,Did not like the material quality
3.0,Skulls are not proportionate to rest of ring. Although my wife thought is was still pretty she also wishes the skulls were bigger.
3.0,Loved the dress but it runs crazy big. Ladies buy a size down I'm warning you.
3.0,It is very pretty and good quality but the sizing is pretty off I ordered a 3X and it's more like an XL
3.0,"Though cute, material is very thin.  Have hand washed in cool water and color now looks navy instead of black.  Very disappointed.(fit is fine but so what?!)"
3.0,"This necklace was very very thin, which's what I was looking for, however, it was way too thin to comfortably wear without the risk of it breaking easily by getting caught on an article of clothing, your hair, earring, anything. Either way, I contacted the seller for a refund, who was speedy with response...I mailed the necklace bk in its original state & packaging, along with the return form that had been emailed to me, & within 4 days of mailing the necklace bk, my refund was in my acct (coming from NY & I'm in TX). Although the necklace wasn't for me, because of the customer svc, I'd def order a diff product from the seller!"
3.0,"They are way more cheap looking than they appear in the photo. The gold looks very gross, I'm not picky & I don't wear these."
3.0,"If they had half sizes, a 7 1/2 would have fit perfectly. I’m an 8 and they are a smidge big. The men’s size they throw at you makes me think they made these to fit men and woman. (Reason they don’t fit nicely)  Not sure if I will keep them. But they are a nice slipper, bottom is pretty tough hard plastic/rubber, great fir running outside for things."
3.0,"I ordered the XL yet my order got changed to a Large some how, it looked very small. I don't think even an XL will fit correctly. The DNA part bothers me like one of those letters is not the same font."
3.0,The fit is great but the material makes you too warm.  I got a blue color and looked great in hiding my  bulks. Looks great in pictures.
3.0,"The design and quality are wonderful. It, however, is just a bit to small for my wrist. I have had to add several links to the end to get it around my wrist (which I actually thought was pretty small). It came from India. Perhaps they have more delicate bone structure than a average American woman. It is lovely though."
3.0,This is a great classic cotton nightgown. But it is thin and see through so I returned it. You cannot tell how thin it is from the pictures and probably don't want to (cannot) show that it is see through.
3.0,I was expecting a better and heavier chain for pendant and I didn't expect to have to put it together I thought it would have arrived already connected. Not pleased with purchase. Not satisfied did mot look like picture.
3.0,"I'm not sure i like it. I chose medium cause that's normally the size i get cause i have that awkward body that sometimes expand, but it seemed big but comfortable, not falling off but makes my body look awkward, it does nothing for my figure, I'm not even sure if I'll wear it."
3.0,"Ordered a medium (7-8) in this suit for my granddaughter. It swallows her. Looks more like she can wear it when she's 12.<br />Super cute suit, but beware sizing!"
3.0,"It runs small...definitely order a size up (or 2 if you child is husky). My son 8 year old son wears a size 12/14; I ordered an 18 so he could grow into it and it just barely fit. It is also quite thin, not a sweater for warmth. Almost more of a “fall” sweater. The style and color are great. Order big and have undershirts ready if your child is going to wear it on a cold day."
3.0,These look so cool but were really small. My fiancé had to really work to get them on and try to stretch out.
3.0,Not flattering with my body type.  I don't have a pronounced rear end.  It would look good if I did.  The fabric is too thin in my opinion.  Fit is true to size.
3.0,"It is so thin, it should only cost between $15 - $20.  The picture looks much better than what I received."
3.0,Seems fine but too big for a lunch bag for my daughter.
3.0,Wouldn't stay on my ear.
3.0,There is no button on one of the sleeves.
3.0,"The shirt is beautiful- I got it in white. But I’m a petite person and I know it’s supposed to be a loose fit, but the small fit more like a large on me. I would exchange if they had an extra-small option, but since they don’t then I’m sadly returning this item."
3.0,"I like the fit of the hat, but the flower on the cap are kind of &#34;washed out&#34; looking. Maybe it is supposed to look that way, but in the photo it doesn't."
3.0,The dress came in within expected dates. It's a super cute dress. The material is very light and see through. The length is shorter than expected. I was disappointed that the seam in the front is not well sowne. My friend bought one for less and it was in better condotion.
3.0,Was excited to get this dress but too tight on the chest. I’m a 38D 5’5 215lbs and order XL. Trying to decide if I should return it.
3.0,My daughter hates the rubber backs. They padded backs are only sold in this back. Wish they were sold separately so I wouldn't be wasting my money
3.0,Didn’t like the look on me.
3.0,"The style was just what I was looking for: 3/4 sleeve, ankle length, nice trim, pin tucks, etc., but the material feels and looks terrible.  I should have known better to buy anything made of mostly rayon.  In addition, the placement of the pockets is unflattering to women with wide hips, making them appear even bigger.  I’ll keep it just to have something to throw on after a shower, but my money could have been better spent."
3.0,Came with hole in thw side. Too small.
3.0,"Cute, but super cheap looking."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:4f0ba066ebeb297f3571d223d72a22b9]] But restricting at first even though I did measure my wrist if I went to a size up it would probably move around too much and it’s only restricting on the one side like shown in the video easy to install and I just thought the quality would be a little bit better material is not what I thought it was in the morning stretches the rest of the design you see
3.0,"One of the shirts smelled like sweat, real bad."
3.0,"Package arrived on time. Capes and mask are a little less than what I expected in quality.  However, my grandson is happy and that's what matters"
3.0,It's a bit bigger than expected. It'll be ok with a shirt under it which is how I'll wear it. Otherwise I'm happy with it.
3.0,"The bag is attractive and roomy. However, the dye bleeds for some reason. I have never owned any leather that bleeds when coming into contact with water. I set the bag on the vanity to remove the packing material, apparently, I set in on a few drops of water because when I moved the bag, the drops of water were brown. I wiped the bottom and sides of the bag with a damp paper towel, and the quite a bit of the dye came off. I guess if I keep rubbing, it will eventually stop coming off. I would expect better quality for a bag that costs almost $30."
3.0,"I like the design. I hate the material (there is no cotton as advertised in mine). I wish they used supreme cotton, it would be nice (I'm willing to pay more for it)"
3.0,Slides loose easily but ok belt.
3.0,"threads coming out of seams, cheap looking, not a premium quality product. However fits and feels allright"
3.0,Big but love them
3.0,"The quality is good. However, the sizing is not accurate. I can wear a large. I ordered XL for a hang loose fit. Didn't work for me and the waistline is really too short. I ordered 4 colors and was hoping to wear these  under a blazer this fall. I will keep looking. Still love me some Amazon."
3.0,The lense is of poor quality. It is distorted on the top and bottom
3.0,I think it’s extremely small! I purchased it for my granddaughter’s birthday
3.0,I love these Jean but crutch and but to big but tight in the legs.
3.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter because I thought it was really cute, but it lasted all of 2 hours before the chain broke."
3.0,Cute but runs super small!
3.0,"Amazing, glow in the dark, but a little bigger than expected"
3.0,"Solid belt and buckle.  Kind of a pain to adjust because of the sliders design.  It isn't like other cobra buckles that you can pull the running end and tighten after you buckle, you have to adjust it when it's unbuckled."
3.0,"they help with glare, but I was expecting more help with reducing the night glare"
3.0,"kinda cheap, broke while i was trying to take it off, but its very pretty"
3.0,Make sure to read the details! Pictures make it look like there is some cotton in these. There is not. Shiny polyester/spandex mix and the band at the top in the picture is deceiving. The stitching makes the high waist/tummy control look like it would hold you in but there is an elastic band that only takes up part of that space. These fit but probably could’ve sized down. Color is vibrant. I will likely keep them but they definitely aren’t what I expected based on the pictures!
3.0,I know Naot sizes small but this time it was ridiculous and frustrating. I love the shoe though.
3.0,This too runs 1 size too small. I am not sure about the fabric. Looks really cheap
3.0,Inconsistent mix of rhinestones.<br />I enjoy making bracelets with these and order them frequently to create them but I can’t be consistent with my creations because the rhinestones are inconsistent.
3.0,The stone kept cutting the roof of my mouth.
3.0,Even after they sent me a bigger one they said would be the right size it was still like 3 sizes to small.
3.0,Love the designs and the ease of switching them out.  But I’ve broken too many with everyday useage.  Once the plastic tunnel that holds the pin is broken there’s no way to fix it.  The plastic doesn’t stand up to everyday exposure to sweat and soap and then breaks without warning next time the watch gets caught on something being carried or even on the edge of a pocket.
3.0,Not the quality I was expecting.
3.0,"This long handled shoe horn is okay, but a little overpriced. In my opinion, the bend or curve should be less. Arrived fast."
3.0,"The way that the 'utility' part moves makes it almost impossible to use. If you just want a decent looking keychain then sure, but don't get it because you want one with a bottle opener. You'll be very dissapointed"
3.0,A bit tight and small around the crotch area.
3.0,"Bought two pair for a week-long ski trip to Colorado. The goggles worked great in sunny conditions, and the changeable lenses were very useful. Where the goggles really struggled, were in snowy conditions. The added moisture and cold led to constant fogging issues. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Covid regulations required your nose to be covered also.  My one recommendation is to put on your goggles and never take them off.  I also noticed where the foam barrier next to your face was starting to break down after only 3 days of use.<br />Overall, these are a decent pair of goggles at their price point."
3.0,"Perfect for my kitchen island sink. Keeps mess out of sight. Allows draining, so hygienic. Enough space for a sponge , a brush and two soap dispensers. Only -ve, very pricey."
3.0,"I wore the earrings and in the first day 2 stones fell out. Then over the course of a few days 3 more came out, one more on one and two more on the other. I have to say, however, that I was relieved that the seller kindly and promptly replaced these earrings. To date, no stones have fallen out of the new pair. That's a great relief. So it was a one step back, three steps forward kind of situation."
3.0,RUNS BIG BUY A SIZE DOWN ..WOULD BUY A MEDIUM NEXT TIME...I BOUGHT A LG...
3.0,"It fit nice everywhere except in the upper arms, it was a little tight.  I am maybe 15-20 lbs overweight so I think the arms just run a little small."
3.0,Fit as expected but wrinkles easily.  Not as long as the other tunics from this manufacturer.
3.0,nice watch but too dark. Trouble reading the time but I am older.
3.0,Earring backs are super small and very loose. Try to tighten and it will get loose again. Everything else is okay.
3.0,Beautiful chain but need to send back.....too short for what I need.
3.0,"I bought this dress in Medium and could barely get the dress on.  I am 5'7&#34;, weigh 132 pounds, and have an apple shape.  I'm not sure what shape person this dress is for, but it was not my shape.  Also, the liner is about 3 inches above the knee and the lace outer layer comes just below the knee.  I personally don't like that much difference in length.  Too bad, though, because it is a cute dress."
3.0,"Material isn’t too bad, the shirt fits a little too big but it’s tucked in so that helps. The flowers on the shirt are a true baby pink but the shorts are more of a coral color? But totally different shades of pinks... I’m keeping it just to avoid the trouble of returning but not totally in love with it."
3.0,"doesnt fit adult head well, now a wall hanger, Nostalgia Berrys!"
3.0,"Looks really cute and has great tummy control. Does not stretch at all though, ripped the inseam doing stretches. Also fits pretty small, definitely size up."
3.0,"These are old school high waist leggings.  They don't appear to have any spandex stretch, as everything does these days.  That said, they are a good length and cheap!  I'll keep them - looking for the right legging  to wear with my beautiful $400 sweater set."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2ed042479c27a7651dbba023e79e7f45]] Purchased on Tuesday, received on Thursday, so that’s a plus. The dress is really cute and for point of reference I am 5’10 weigh 176lbs and purchased a large (no judging lol). Here are my issues....1) the layer underneath the scales is completely sheer mesh material, so you will definitely need to wear something underneath 2) the scales are not secured well so I will have to fasten them down a little better. One came off as soon as I tried the dress on. 3) the scales are very light plastic and weren't cut properly and several pieces have jagged edges.<br /><br />Although I can tell this dress is cheaply made with flimsy material, I will put in a little work and wear it in Vegas for my 50th birthday. Wish me luck🙂<br /><br />UPDATE...I’ve posted a video to show how eye catching this dress is. Be prepared to lose some scales while you shimmy. My friends collected several so I could re-attach. What would I do with out friends? lol"
3.0,I bought this tie to learn how to tie a bow tie...tie.  I have a pretty thick neck and this worked.
3.0,"Wasn't the material I was expecting. For the price, it's not too bad though."
3.0,"I had ordered this skirt in tan and it fits great, so I ordered it blue. When I put the blue skirt on, it fit good, but the elastic was too tight and it cut into my waist. I ended up having to cut the elastic out just to be comfortable. I did not do an exchange, because it was sent from China and there was no way I was going to wait for that."
3.0,"Very cute, super thin fabric and about two sizes smaller than what I ordered. Had to wear it high wasted to button it and that made it a super super mini skirt."
3.0,"I wanted to love these.<br />I'm in my 3rd trimester in the heat of summer and needed shorts for everyday wear.<br />They aren't horrible, but I think the fit is a bit funny.  I'm not a small girl (5'8"", size 12 before pregnancy] so I ordered the XL to be safe based on size recommendations (i have gained 25 pounds this oregnancy, 33 weeks along).  While the material is super soft (like jeggings, mentioned in other reviews), it wasn't as stretchy as I'd hoped (UNLIKE jeggings) ; the main issue seemed to be in the butt area, like it was smashing/ flattening my butt, which isn't really big.  Being so tight across my butt, made the rest of the fit seem weird/ uncomfortable, especially while sitting.  I wear a large in other maternity brands with no issue, so J was surprised at how uncomfortable these XLs felt.<br />I wore them out and about but couldn't wait to get home and change."
3.0,"Was probably expecting too much, thus not too impressed. My hubby and I have astigmatism and see big star bursts around lights, so we were excited to try night vision glasses. These mostly turn everything yellow and only slightly minimize star bursts, but I guess something is better than nothing."
3.0,It came broke. The second hand wasn’t attached
3.0,"Even though the sizing chart is a great guide to use and I definitely ordered the right size for the fit I wanted, they run very short in the torso. I'm 5'7&#34; and generally around 119 lbs and I ordered a large. It's a slim fit, not really much compression at this size. But they look great and are very comfortable."
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 29 waist, 36 hips. Normally a size medium in bottoms. These fit, but I have a big butt and these are very tight in the cheeks. If I could have I would have returned them. Maybe order a size up if you’re like me."
3.0,color is not bright
3.0,Looks cheap and hard to use
3.0,Super cute but runs small. In every bathing suit bottom I'm a large but this felt like a medium and pinched around the leg holes.  I am going to get the next size up and hopefully it fits
3.0,The captive ring and the regular septum ring that both had the balls covered in little jewels were cheaply made. The jewels just starting falling off. It was like the actual ball was covered in a quick drying putty and the jewels were just poorly pushed into it in an attempt to make them stick. The hearts are all cute though 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,For the price the whole key chain feels and looks cheaply made. I’ve had cheaper keychains that feel and look better made.  Not sure it will last being attached to keys. It is not even a solid elephant. You only get one side of the elephant. The other side is basically the molding or outline. Very disappointed!
3.0,"Nice quality, but poor fit. The dress was too small, and the details were just off like the neckline. I’m sure if you able to fit into it well everything else would look so much better.<br />For it was just one those dresses that looks better in the picture."
3.0,This shirt runs extremely small! I returned it!
3.0,Nice product but they need to make bigger sizes
3.0,i like them fine. they are just difficult to put in sometimes.
3.0,"BIG BIG BIG.  If you have remotely small wrists this will look comical when you wear it.  If you are thinking about purchasing this watch, sketch out the dimensions based on the ad.  And then cut out the circle and hold it up to your wrist.  It's seriously a large timepiece with a very small clock on it.  I have fairly large wrists (or what I always THOUGHT were fairly large wrists) and this looks BIG on me.  Seems made fairly well and is fashionable - but -- did I mention it is BIG???"
3.0,"Unless you size way up, this doesn't fit like the picture. I went up one size but it still doesn't fall off the shoulder. Just looks like a really wide neck instead. Otherwise it fits nicely. Very comfortable and light."
3.0,"Although I LOVE the way this fits around the torso and really brings out my figure, I have to say the slit is way too high. I expected it up there so I bought a size up and I still think with one wrong move, something no one wanted to see could've popped out. Another reason for my star rating, is the material. It feels like a costume I'd wear at a dance recital which I should've expected with the price."
3.0,Runs small. But look nice.
3.0,I didn't like the material. It was stretchy and shows every bump and roll. I returned it. I wanted to love it 😔
3.0,Adorable but if you are at all tall- WAY too short. I ordered 2 sizes up to try to get length and it was still too short to wear for work.
3.0,Don’t fit as well or feel as well as the copper fit socks with the purple logo at the top of the sock. Purchased for everyday use.
3.0,Size M. Fabric is quite heavy and makes warm. 5’ 8”/142lbs quite fit to me.
3.0,It's so pretty BUT the heart fell off the chain.
3.0,I was hoping I could make the whole sizes work but I am a true 7.5.  Please make half sizes.  I hate when cute shoes only come in full sizes.
3.0,"I didn't get any stickers, when it says 50 stickers are included."
3.0,"-The warmness, I tried them in the heavy snow day it's not that warm I could feel the cold , but for the normal cold days i think it's good .<br />- the fabric , is soft nice for you hands.<br />- the looking, is great"
3.0,The joggers were slightly too big length wise for me but that’s pretty normal as I’m 5 ft exactly. My only problem is after the first wear the material started to clump up from my thighs rubbing against each other.
3.0,"I ordered this for my son's 1st Birthday Party. Very cute shirt and color combo however I suggest going a size up, maybe 2 sizes."
3.0,"My husband did not like how it looked on me.  He said I looked frumpy.  Cute style, just not for me."
3.0,What you don't see in the picture is that the side of the tie that looks like circuit board has very shiny silver thread or streaks running though it.  Very shiny silver.
3.0,"Its a great looking belt, and I absolutely love the concept to the buckle. However, maybe it is because I am on the larger side, but when I sit or move from sitting to standing, the ratchet on the buckle slips. I was having to constantly tighten the bucle. I eventually went back to my traditional style belt!"
3.0,"First off, I wear size 7.5 but these are probable a whole half size too large.So ladies please size down!!!These are for women with very narrow feet as the front is very narrow. The lil heel is very cute and makes the shoe easy to dress up your outfit. The material used is fairly good. If you have narrow feet then take  my advice and you would get a really cute pair of shoes."
3.0,I thought it would have fitted a little more loose.  It hugs under the bust.
3.0,Cheap looking and also they look large.
3.0,It fits well and very solid. But has a slight tendency to discolor skin.
3.0,"Haven't worn it yet, so far only tried it on. Fits nicely though!"
3.0,"A good cheap option for a multifunction bag -- wallet, crossbody, and wristlet. The red is really bright -- brighter than the photo, I think, but not in a bad way. The bag is a bit small for me, but it's light and therefore a good option for travel."
3.0,Falls off of my head every easily
3.0,The leather is far from soft and the outer skin is already peeling. Could be a lot better!
3.0,Material  looks very cheap.
3.0,I purchased it because I was led to believe it would fit under the seat of the aircraft. It did not . I like everything else about it
3.0,"Though it's a great case, looks cool and offers great convenience, it has already come undone at the edges. There are these glued pieces that have peeled away that comprise the edge design. Also, the stitching of the pockets has come undone on one side as well. I got maybe a month or two use out of this case; which seems short to me and a real shame cause I loved this case...it felt great in my hand."
3.0,"Fit well, I believe I bought a large. The material is cheap which I kind of expected given the price. This dress is sexy but if you can’t wear a braw with it, so I would say buy so it’s snug otherwise your gonna pop a nipple! Or get boob tape to hold yourself in there"
3.0,"I'd gotten Avery in a size 14 and they fit.  When I got these size 14's they were smaller, and fit about the same as the size 12s I had, which were a bit snug.  My size 12s are the same color and everything so I'm not sure why such a variation."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this shirt, but it's just a tad too small and VERY thin."
3.0,It looks beautiful but made with cheap materials. It clinks when you walk from the hardware.
3.0,These were better quality than expected. That being said I wasn’t expecting too much. They broke after about a month of wear.
3.0,Bag was too big. Returned it.
3.0,The dress is beautiful...the color and the design.  It was too small for me so I ended up giving it to my niece
3.0,"A little on the smaller side. Not comfy, but very cute!"
3.0,"These glasses seem fragile even for the el cheapo polarized sunglasses that I normally buy.  Just the slightest bump or drop will knock the lens out.  I have to be careful cleaning them so that the lens doesn't come out.  And they developed a little blur line right at the upper edge of the lens, which is a little annoying.  But still, serviceable polarized sunglasses."
3.0,"The fabric is not the best quality, the finish is fairly good, but for the price you can not expect much ..!"
3.0,Dress was ok quality but runs large. I had to return and would have repurchased in a small if the price was not double the price I paid just 3 days prior.
3.0,Since winter was coming up i wanted to get something warm and cute but this was wayy too big. I ordered 0-3 months and when i compared it to my babies other clothes the jumper was pretty much closer to 6-9 months instead of 0-3. Would not recommend
3.0,"After only a few wears and gentle washes, the stitching is coming loose!  The overall fit is fine but the extra seams on the legs are not comfortable."
3.0,"I ordered this in brown, but it's like a &#34;worn&#34; brown, not deep brown.  I had to send it back because it had a hole in the side seam.  Didn't really like it enough to order another one, so I sent it back."
3.0,"My 3 year old loves these and wants to wear them 24-7.  Unfortunately, they run incredibly small and continue to shrink after each wash.  She is constantly pulling the bottom of the legs back down and the top is just now starting to look incredibly small.  It is almost becoming a midriff.  The sleeves are starting to get snug, but are still a decent length.  She is a very petite kid and the 3T just isn't cutting it.  I'd recommend sizing up at least 1 or 2 sizes for longevity."
3.0,I bought these as the reviews leans towards them being big and that’s what I was looking for however these are tiny! It’s constantly going back up in my nose. They are super cute and definitely worth the money but for someone with a runny nose not average.
3.0,I would not recommend this bag for beach use but rather swimming pool use. Sand comes through the open mesh bottom and gets on everything in the bag.
3.0,These are pretty but they did not stay in my nose. Fell out while I was sleeping and my nose ring closed :(
3.0,This more for wearing underneath a dress and not to workout in.
3.0,Flap does not hold up too well. Flash hole is too small. Can't take a photo with flash with the case on. It's pretty though!
3.0,"It's ok ,not a watch I would show off. The band feels cheap and the brown started to make my white shirt cuff turn brown"
3.0,It didn't meet my expectations. I wasn't expecting it too look childish. I gave them to my daughter to play with.
3.0,"These shirts were REALLY big, and that's saying alot since I'm no small person myself. Make sure to order these about a size smaller than you'd think you would normally wear. The length was fine but the shirt slows like a dress. Also, after washing a couple of times they tend to fade and are no longer the solid black they were when I bought them."
3.0,Like the style but it's a tight fit.
3.0,"Don’t like that it’s not real, amethyst is everywhere, why fake it?"
3.0,"got what i paid for. I wanted a soft sole house shoe. They have a fabricate, with those no skid nubs, and not meant to wear outside. Well i forget about the no wear outside and the soft sole wears thru, but duct tape fixes it. LOL"
3.0,"Not exactly as I expected, but it worked for the purpose I bought it for!"
3.0,This bracelet looks nice but it will not fit a larger wrist.
3.0,I wasn't  expecting it to be this material. Hopefully  my husband will still love it
3.0,I have bought at lease 6 Nato -Zulu type bands this one I didn't care for the hardware is just to small and cheap looking-the quality of the strap itself is good it's just the buckle I didn't like
3.0,"The package arrived quickly, so that was cool.  I only have one complaint. The earring does not look like the picture. The ones that I received have a indented ridge around the perimeter.  It looks like it is meant to have a rubber o-ring but they weren't included."
3.0,It falls down again and again otherwise good quality.
3.0,"The heart stone is too big. Fills up the entire belly button space, this would be cute if it were a smaller. This boarders on tacky instead of cute and dainty."
3.0,"Fit good, just not the color in the picture"
3.0,"They are really pretty, but they are way to big for my body frame. Wish they were a little smaller."
3.0,"I wear a medium and ordered an XL<br />The body fits like a small but the sleeves!  Ugh, the sleeves are WAY too short.  I have a bad feeling about what is going to happen when I wash it."
3.0,"Came today the envelop was overkill. They they were inside 4 different packages. More overkill, but I guess I wasn't expecting them to be that tiny. I can hardly handle them. I got them for the up ear cartilage and I can't put them in myself. Gonna have to wait until someone is here to help me put them in."
3.0,"I'm a 36D. This is cute and soft lace. Fits nicely around the ribs. The extra detail straps fit nice. There is a bit of an odd fit for me. For a bralette, which are not usually made for girls my size or bigger, it has good support through the front bust line and the band but the cups just have no side support. The girls want to escape from the side which is something I've never experienced inn my life. Still cute but i would not feel comfortable going out in it"
3.0,"This is a brief report that is just focused on one flaw with this item plus one complaint.<br /> The Beanie has a multi-tag that is most securely sewed into the inside of the item and if you don't want to be wearing a tag against your head then you might need to have a profession ""seamstress"" surgically remove the tag. Otherwise if you attempt to cut it out on your own you might remove essential stitching that is part of the items seam!<br />The complaint: Amazon info did not indicate that the item comes from China. I am stating this as a compliant because I had searched specifically for ""USA made"" and the Amazon page for this item didn't reveal the origin of manufacturing."
3.0,"Está bien, pero es para niños."
3.0,Like the design but the product came with a few discolorations and loose threads. Runs small but for a regular medium you should only go one size up my xl was too baggy
3.0,"Looks nice, but smaller than expected. Not able to wear it. :("
3.0,It is definitely NOT rayon. It’s for sure polyester. That was a disappointment as I specifically looked for a natural fiber over polyester. Otherwise the fit is fine and it serves its purpose.
3.0,"Love that it fit size wise, but the waist is set right under the bust, not like shown in picture. Still like it and plan on keeping it. Just wish the waistline was closer to natural waistline since pocket are up around my ribs instead of near my hips."
3.0,It was nice but too small. I bought for my Mom in law but then I returned them.
3.0,"The mask is nice, but I wouldn't buy it again.  It's practically child-sized, and the mask ties on with an elastic string which is a little too short.  It's fine for me since I'm just using it for photos; but as a previous poster mentioned, I'd be upset if I were trying to get any serious use out of it."
3.0,"the way the ring is being advertise is beautiful, but when it arrived i wasn't so thrilled like i thought i'd be. the center stone looks fake and instead of it being inbedded like i thought it would be it's &#34;prong like&#34; held. Unfortunately i'm stuck with it now until i can get something better."
3.0,"The ends don't slide into each other as effortlessly as I thought they would, and the material is rather stiff.  Overall, they are a decent value at this price, but I would not buy again."
3.0,"This blouse is sort of an ugly color blue, not really navy, but more of a drab gray/blue.  Style is nice."
3.0,While it is a nice piece of jewelry it's definitely NOT sterling. There's a nicely placed fake Chinese stamp but I would've preferred the truth. Now back to the review. It's a very shiny pendent that opens to a shockingly roomy compartment. Way larger than I anticipated being a somewhat dainty pendent. That was a pleasant surprise. Just for a mental note on the size of the compartment - I put a round Excedrin headache pill inside & it closed with no problem. I hope that gives a good  size comparison. The chain is nice until you get to the extended part- that section looks cheesy & cheap. I'm gonna put it on a whole different chain that's a little longer. I do love the necklace but wish the description was accurate about the Sterling part. For the price you pay the item is a great deal & I think anyone would love to have it. Just put a few tweaks on it and it will be loved.
3.0,I LIKE THE CHARM BUT THE CHAIN DISCOLORED THEN RUSTED WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
3.0,"It's comfortable and my son loves the sonic print. It's extremely thin. Not real cloth, it's spandex. We have to fold over the material in order to use it for what he needs."
3.0,"I'm 5'4 135lbs.<br />I bought a medium, but I could have gotten away with a small so a little disappointing."
3.0,"I ordered this in XL. The bottoms fit good (however a tiny but loose) but the top is a bit too small for a 36DD. It's a really cute bathing suit though, and the quality is nice."
3.0,The material used is super soft and oh so comfortable! That is one of the things I love most about it! I wore it once though and already found a little hole in the right arm sleeve. Also the size ran a tad small.
3.0,"5&#34;2, around 125ibs, got XS. Run big. No compression at all. Just regular workout tanks. The length is nice."
3.0,I ordered two of these the chains are different on each one but a lot of people said the chains turned their skin colors so that makes me worry. Apparently only the heart is sterling which is a little deceptive.
3.0,"Robe was advertised as ""plush"" but the material was was way too thin"
3.0,"I like the look and feel of this purse but only the large, main compartment is deep enough to even hold my phone!  The outside zipper sections are so shallow that they really can only be used for little things like lip balm, a credit card, flat-packaged pills, etc.  I use it when I'm going somewhere that my ""everyday"" hobo bag isn't appropriate but I won't need a water bottle, umbrella or even all of my keys.  I got it at a great sale price so decided to keep it for those occasions."
3.0,Note there's no pole. Seems a bit pricey for just a flag.
3.0,The masks are a bit big for a young kiddo like my 5 year old and one of the asks faces was upside-down from the metal nose band. But it took so long to get them I need them for my daughter so we just have to deal with it being done wrong.
3.0,this sucks
3.0,"This was okay, the price is perfect for the quality. I bought a large based on the suggested size."
3.0,"Good not great. Light cotton fabric that seemed a bit cheap, but I only needed it for my baby shower. My main issue is that the split at the front was higher than I was comfortable with. When standing, it wasn’t too bad. But I had to sit and open gifts in front of people so I ended up putting a safety pin lower on the split to keep from flashing people. It may be better when I’m not pregnant, but I have a feeling it won’t matter. It’ll still be shorter then I’m comfortable with."
3.0,The shoes are really cute but the sizes are not consistent  I ordered 2 pairs of shoes different styles. One fits the other is about a size too small.  I will have to spend about 3 times the price of the shoes to return them to China. I won't be buying from this company again. I probably will donate the shoes to Good Will. A lesson to be learned.
3.0,More like a tuck me in kinda thing! Vera being able to wear it out! Ya feel like your showing your underwear aka under garnets
3.0,"I really love this 2 necklace set! Sadly after a month and a half, I was wearing the smaller one and it just fell off of me without touching it. It was too late for me to return it or initiate a replacement. It broke where the clasp was. I guess I will try to fix it but it is super small."
3.0,Tbh not bad but the tape on the box ripped off the logo when I gave it as a gift. Other than that the material was pretty meh
3.0,"I like the fit of this shirt how ever a lot of detail that Russell brand used to do they are not doing anymore, for example they do not put the Russell embroidery logo on the sleeve anymore, and they do not feel as heavy as they used to be.  I found out that Warren  Buffet or Berkshire Hathaway is now the owner of Russell brand, I guess putting profit margin ahead of quality is the way they do things...  I wish Proctor and Gamble would buy this brand, then I know for sure it would be well made."
3.0,"Yes, it's soft.  No, it's not heavy or warm enough for me."
3.0,"Quality not as good to me, on my body it was a bit to transparent. Therefore, I was not a fan but I did like the stretch it has to it... $17 was too much for this dress."
3.0,"Nice color and material but no tag, can’t verify if its silk, more likely its rayon viscose or something judging by the weave."
3.0,This is a thick winter mask.
3.0,A bit too long and the material is too shiny.
3.0,Print was pixelated
3.0,They are good shorts have the right amount of stretch but good be a little longer
3.0,it doesn't look so pretty.
3.0,Really cute if it wasn't a foot long... I can roll it up and ill just work it untill it droops down but untill them it fits like a come. Cute though.
3.0,"It seems like it would be reliable, and opening it up is very easy. I cannot use it because the end of the cable is a thicker ball which is too big for me to do a direct attachment of my key FOB. My key FOB has an opening to attach a keyring, as they all do, but the only way to attach the FOB to this is to first attach a small ring to the FOB."
3.0,"After my toddler ripped the arm off my Ray Bans for the second time I was in search for a cheap replacement pair of aviators until she's older or I can hide my sunglasses better. These had a lot of mixed reviews so I wasn't exactly sure but they just arrived and I'm happy with them for the price I paid. They are similar to my Ray Bans but not quite the same (which is fine because I paid less than $7 for these rather than the $150+ for real ones lol). The biggest difference is that my Ray Bans have a more curved lens that covers more of the top and sides, they are not quite as dark tint wise, and they are more of a yellow gold than just a regular Ray Ban gold. They fit well on my face, though they arrived a little squished and had to be bent back straight. I like that these filter and protect against UVA and UVB light 100% according to the sticker/tags on them when they arrived; additionally they are categorically level three which is rated for &#34;strong brightness.&#34; I ordered the gold frame/brown lens and will probably be ordering a second pair for my husband and maybe another pair of the mirrored ones for me.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Lowering my rating to three stars because after three months the arm has become so loose that they won't stay on (I've tried tightening the screw). I also have ordered four pairs in total now (two brown lens/gold frame and two smoke lens/silver frame) and have received one pair that wasn't even the right color and my browns are not the same at all. This is incredibly frustrating! For the price they are still okay but be warned you might not get the color you order or even the same shade of the exact same ones you did order. (Added picture of different ones I've received minus a mirrored pair that came instead of the smoke ones)"
3.0,Fabric was thinner than expected.  The torso length was not as long either.  Returning item.
3.0,"Not a fan of the fabric, not as sleek as the photo makes it look for sure. Look at review photos to get a good idea, they are accurate"
3.0,quality is good except for the trim.  fake leather trim....poor quality of vinyl.  I expected leather on the small areas of trim.  disappointed for the price.
3.0,These are very nice but be careful because the little pin on the closure will snag your shirt if you rub against it.
3.0,Good size tote bag but the leather felt more like pleather for me.  I didn’t have any problem returning it.  I was given a prepaid UPS shipping label.
3.0,"(update) Initially I loved these though not as stretchy as ones I had bought at department store. However, the department store ones I have had for 4 years and still in excellent shape, these did not hold up...within 6 months started tearing at waist seams and looking worn all over.<br /><br />I have used Marilyn Monroe panties before made a little different so I gave these a try. Perfect fit, comfortable...totally happy with product."
3.0,"It should be noted that the hands on the watch are silver whereas the other metal parts are all in gold.  It doesn't have a look that a designer would allow in production, in short it looks like a cheaper watch."
3.0,Like it was a good cost for the quality and quantity
3.0,The leggings are sift and comfortable but not fleece lined at all.
3.0,The value was good but the straps keeps coming off when you move your hand. I hand to order a different band.
3.0,"Cute idea but the waistline is long by about 1"". It fell at belly button. Both my daughter (5'4"") &  I (5'6"") had the same issue."
3.0,Don’t like material that well
3.0,Nice skinny belt. I hope it holds up after repeated use.
3.0,My child has cerebral palsy and she reported that the double Velcro system posed difficulties.
3.0,"The product said it's for a child, but it's really not.  My daughter is 6 and a little over 48&#34; tall.  I as able to literally pull the waistband up to her armpits, and could have gone up further if the crotch seam hadn't prevented me.  I had to fold them so much to get them to sit at her waist.  We also ran into the problem of them riding down on her legs and excess material gathering at her ankles because they were too long.<br /><br />We got these to go with her Spider Girl costume for Halloween, so they served their purpose, but these are more fitted for a teenager or small adult - not a child.  I know it says one size fits all and I did not expect them to fit exactly, but it was a little ridiculous at how big they were.  I guess on the positive side, my daughter still enjoys dressing up in her costume and these tights when at home so at least we are getting our money's worth :)"
3.0,The picture shows rhinestones on body of dress and the one I recieved did not have them. I was a little disappointed with that. The quality of the dress I really liked!
3.0,"Product arrived as described.  However, the leading edges of the buckle are sharp enough to cut or damage webbing and will need to be sanded and painted (if you choose) before use."
3.0,"Leggings look cool but they are a little rough, not like workout pants. Good for the price"
3.0,I thought the material would have a sweatshirt or t shirt look but instead it had a shiny smooth finish that does not appeal to me but my grand daughter didn't seem to mind. Size was good. It has not been washed yet.
3.0,you get what you pay for-cheap price for cheap quality. the first time my son gets into it it tears right by the zipper at his rear end! he wasn't pulling on it or anything i helped him carefully into it so he wouldn't and with only a little pressure it tore. i didn't rate lower because it is as shown and does fit and is a good price even for cheap stitching.
3.0,"This a pretty dress and nicely made.  However, I order 2 times my size and it was still way too small to fit.  I'm not sure they make this dress large enough to fit a size 14 and up."
3.0,"Bought this ca. 4 years ago.  Still metal rods that maintain the shape of the bag wore through the fabric.  I cut the rods; duck taped the hole from where they protruded so they wouldn't rip up the upholstery in my car or catch on any other fabric creating a tear.  Can't recommend this bag; after only 4 years of regular use the rods poked through the fabric creating a problem.  Threw it away and bought the Ultimate Gym Bag 2.0: The Durable Crowdsource Designed Duffel Bag with 10 Optimal Compartments Including Water Resistant Pouch (Black, Medium (20"")) which I like much better."
3.0,I love it but size isnt right.
3.0,These are cheap plastic but good for what I needed them for - a bobs burger halloween costume. Good price for something I was going to wear only once.
3.0,"I was very excited to have found solid black and white bras in my size (34DDD). Finding anything in that size is always a struggle, let alone anything “normal” for daily wear.<br />I was disappointed with what actually arrived. I only received 1 bra when I ordered the 2-pack. Also, the one that arrived was NOT either color; nor did it have the adjustable straps allowing it to be worn in a “cross-cross”. The color was also white with black lace; so I guess it was close but not the solids I was looking for.<br />I did give 3 stars because despite it not being what I wanted, it did actually fit quite well. I plan to return and try my order again. Hopefully I’ll at least get my full order next time."
3.0,Xtra large Runs small and especially after washing cold water and drying extra low smaller
3.0,"I bought this because I thought it was cotton.  When it arrived, I tried it on and the fit is fine, but the material feels a lot more like rayon than cotton - maybe I'm wrong, but there was no tag inside the skirt that gave material contents so I sent it back."
3.0,Bought for my 5 yr old she loves them but they are a little big and the backs easily fall off. So have to be careful.
3.0,It's ok. It had a very strong unpleasant sent. I assume it was from the dye. It was supposed to be a gift but it smelled to bad so i couldn't give it to the person.
3.0,"This is a beautiful necklace.  I was expecting a light pink to match other jewelry I already own, but the necklace I received was a dark pink.  This is a major problem with Amazon sellers, the description and picture is not always what you receive."
3.0,"Semi thick metal, refer to gauge size if possible...will not fit if pierced with small gauged needle"
3.0,"These frames are amazing in terms of design, durability, and overall comfort. The only downside is it doesn't block out the sun very well, only a small percentage. I still use them though because they look amazing."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f11ced6cdc8eff8ccea2a67350915780]] It doesn’t seem like it was stitched very well, i loved it when it first came in and now it is broken on both sides. Kinda upset :("
3.0,"The material was more like a swimsuit than a sports bra, but the real reason I returned it was it's far too small. You MUST be a small cup size for it to fit. Bought the XL for my fiance who is a 34DD and it was hilariously small but perfectly fit her torso, so going to a XXL won't work."
3.0,Had a lot of broken keys and had too many small keys
3.0,Love the pattern and style but it runs a little small. I wish I had ordered a size up.
3.0,"Color and material was nice,  but which way is front?  No tag or marking.  Also,  if you are a medium or large,  better get a 2XL.. runs super small"
3.0,It was a little bit smaller than I expected...
3.0,Missing a button when I opened it and another button popped off the first time I wore it but don't have time to return it because I have to wear it for work.
3.0,"This sweater is soft and stretchy and the green color is vibrant. The v-neck is flattering but is modest enough for work. I ordered my normal size and think it fits true to size. (You order your U.S. size; pay no attention to the size tag in the shirt - that is Asian size.) The sweater I received was far shorter than the one in the listing. I'm pretty petite, so things normally are longer on me than on the model. This fits far differently from the photo. If you'd like a shorter sweater, this is it.  I returned it due to the length, but I think it's a nice top."
3.0,"I had a similar Buxton red case like this for years - loved it - but finally had to get a new one.  This one is not as compact as the other, a bit bulky, but it is okay and will serve my needs."
3.0,It works great for indoor sports but doesn't last long... two weeks of everyday wear for 2 hours.  I may have to look for sturdier ones but I do like the fit.
3.0,"My daughter loves it but because it doesn't provide a side view,  you don't see that it is actually a gold box with leather and straps only on two sides which was unexpected.  I was expecting to keep it myself but ended up giving it to the girl that likes things very, very organized (it does have a few compartments)."
3.0,"Bought this for my Mom. After she wore it, i noticed that it's shorter than the photo shows, which gives it a slightly boxer appearance. The material is like a t-shirt but in the photo appears to be thicker or sweater-like. It's not. With that said, it was still a nice shirt, especially for $10. Just know it's length isn't accurate so its more of a square shape than rectangle shaped garmet."
3.0,Read the top portion!
3.0,Cheaply made.  May wear as a night gown.
3.0,Okay but not good quality.
3.0,The onesies are cute but they all faded after the first gentle cycle wash.
3.0,Fits nice just I think it’s to thin the material
3.0,"Fit well, warm, but smelled bad. Chemical smell, very unpleasant."
3.0,"fits well, just not the hat advertised."
3.0,Earrings are very nice......not crazy about necklace.
3.0,Very cute and looks like picture. However sizing runs big.
3.0,"Arrived quickly and it is cute, but the material is rather cheap. There are white spots on it where the dye missed the fabric. It is also a bit wavy along the stitching. The shorts are somewhat large as well (though I don't have the thickest thighs either). They don't really hold the balls well.  I have another fulbelle that's much nicer and better made. The shorts are still kinds loose."
3.0,Somewhat smaller fit than expected
3.0,Love the color and look but picks way to easy.
3.0,DO NOT BUY THIS KIND EVER!<br />I HAVE A DARK BLUE PAIR AND ARMY GREEN COLOR AND BOTH HAVE HUGE HOLES FROM THE WAIST TO THE POCKET! THE DARK BLE ONE IS MISSING THE BUTTON TO HOLD THEM UP! I CAN'T RETURN THEM UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE 30 DAY RULE. I BOUGHT THEM MAY 25TH AND TRIED TO RETURN THEM IN EARLY JULY!!!<br />DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND! (see photos)
3.0,"I wanted to love this but it is just too, too small - even though I ordered up a size."
3.0,Pretty much what I expected but the pockets are not deep.
3.0,I mean for what I used them for they rusted I used them for slime so I'm sure that's not what they are for .
3.0,A bit large and the straps are too long and I'll have to take them in so that they span the chest properly. Beautiful fabric and feels good and soft. I just hate that I've got to work in it to make it fit right.
3.0,The bracelet seems a little small. Hope it fits. It’s a Xmas present
3.0,"not impressed by the quality, they're like flimsy almost-plastic-like material rather than soft cotton. I ordered a VERY similar product from another company previously that were much more sturdy; these looked like the same thing but they're not. They do stay put though."
3.0,"Nice sandals, fit well looks good on the feet. Only downfall is that there seems to be no grip at all on the soles of these sandals, so it presents a bit of an issue when walking in the mall on the smooth tiles. You have to be very careful as slips and falls can occur from a normal gait"
3.0,"Returned, did not like. Also too small for my use."
3.0,Size up.. too small
3.0,"Love these, though the mesh is already letting loose and I haven't worn them often. The material is comfortable but certainly not sturdy like some yoga pants. I do like the venting nonetheless and they're fine to move around in. Not super expensive nor is there any tummy control in them, but overall they're fine."
3.0,"So I was hoping to use these for snowboarding, ended up returning them. They are warm and waterproof, don’t get me wrong. However they are so thick I can’t feel the bindings I can’t even grab my phone due to the thickness, little to much for the skiing/snowboarding use"
3.0,"I have problems with Morton's Neuromas in both feet and have found that the only shoe I can comfortably wear is Birkenstock (even the expensive custom orthotics the podiatrist had made for me are not as comfortable as Birkenstocks).. So I own well over 20 pair of sandals, tennis shoes, loafters, even a pair of low heel dress shoes - my size is ALWAYS 38R (outlined footprint). I've longed for boots like this for awhile now. I waited on pins and needles for these boots after finally deciding to order them from Germany. When they arrived, I was overjoyed upon opening the box. They are so lovely and well made (and a very good price too). The leather is a beautiful deep chocolate brown! They are just what you'd expect if you are a fan of Birkenstock. My joy was quickly turned to bitter disappointment though when I tried them on. I could not even get my foot into the right boot. I did get the left boot on my foot, but could not zip it up. Although I am a petite 5' woman who wears a size 10 skinny jean, I have muscular calves (15"") from years of playing softball as a catcher, lots of squats. I contacted the seller and was told that my size must have changed... really? Funny that all my other Birkenstocks fit just fine. I've read another review that the Footprint brand runs short in the foot. I am certain that I own a few pair of Footprints (as well as Birkis, Newwalk, Betual, etc) and I've never noticed a problem. 38R fits me perfectly, until this pair.  If you order this boot, be aware that not only does the shoe size run small, so you better order up at least 1 size, but your calves should not be over 13"" and I'm not positive that will fit. That is just my best guess based on how far I could zip them up. Incidentally, I went out shopping the other day and found that plenty of other boots in both regular and wide shaft sizes zip up just fine for me, so evidentially my calves are not that huge. Sadly though, they don't have the Birkenstock insole so in just a short time, the nerves in the bottom of my feet were irritated and I could not wear them."
3.0,I am still trying the item
3.0,"They are pretty comfy, but the colored lens pictures is not polarized. It comes with a black polarized lens you have to swap out and a yellow thick lens, cleaning cloth and rope for holding around your neck."
3.0,Look nice and are cozy.  Would. Ot recommend for older ladies with stability issues.  Definitely NOT VIONIC STANDARDS. Would return if I had not worn them for one day.
3.0,Was so excited to finally find a blinking fedora  in turquoise!!! I wear l.e.d hats all the time for parties&special events I host! However this hat ARRIVED FOLDED IN HALF..CAN YOU BELIEVE IT! What was the mfg thinking???What a stupid way to ship a hat.I guess they assume we all have flat heads!Need it for special event in 2 days so I have try to steam out the creases as best I can!!!!
3.0,"the picture looks much more ""bedazzled"" than it actually is - you would be fine just ordering a purple mask."
3.0,"I got the large & I am 143 lbs and 36DD.  The overall fit wasnt bad, except that in order to support my chest, I had to tighten the straps to the point that it caused discomfort.  This suit would have probably been great if I was a C cup."
3.0,These shorts are cute. highlights your curves and make your butt look fantastic!  but the strings are just ugh. They are too stringy and get tangled together it was really bad upon arrival. The strings shed so be on a look out for that.<br /><br />If you are bigger then a size 18 do not buy this it will not fit. I got the largest size and my pants size can range from a 14-18. The shorts are definitely comfortable but they are a tad bit tight in the crotch area which is why I definitely won’t be wearing these outside of photos or for a extended period of time afraid it’ll give me a yeast infection even though they are not that tight. Better safe then yeasty.<br /><br />The material is not one I expected it actually decently good material! I honestly thought they would feel paper thin. All in all they are great except for those strings.
3.0,It's  cute and does the job. I just thought it would be a bit bigger.
3.0,"This is not designed for plus size women, it fits but it is designed for a slimmer woman and then sized up. The material quality is okay, but if you are tall and fat like me, Try this brand [[ASIN:B01DOE9FU4 Poetic Justice Curvy Women's Plus Size Stretch Denim Basic Slim Bootcut Jeans Size 24 x 33Length]] . The materiel is just as cheap, but the fit is amazing."
3.0,True to size<br />Nice fit and style<br />Thin jersey material<br />pale colour<br />Not sure what to expect aft a couple washes<br />Not the quality I was expecting for the price... Dissatisfied
3.0,There color is dusty mauve. The lace is like bridal wear lace. Reminds me of an old bridesmaid dress.
3.0,Unfortunately this outfit was too small for me to comfortably wear. The tank top fits fine but the shorts are way too tight around my hips. They fit around the waist but then I’d have a huge wedgie with my butt hanging out. The lace is cute and gives it a little sexy twist but it’s not for me.
3.0,"I ordered a large, based on the guidance suggested by the manufacturer as well as reviews.  Upon arrival, it fit like a large around but there was so little coverage of ""things"", I was falling out of it.  I would need an XXL for coverage, and then it would be too large around my chest."
3.0,I love the material is nice and soft and I can't even wear it😪
3.0,"Material is decent, zipper is hefty, shirt does not hang well"
3.0,They got holes in toes after 2 uses.
3.0,I had my husband get this for me.. The material is not as I expected.. It feels like some type of thick nylon/polyester.. Does not look or feel cotton soft as the picture.
3.0,I cannot return it because I threw everything out I was not happy.the Pearl's was to fat. The Pearl is self is beautiful and pink is one of my favorite color
3.0,Love the shirt but the bottom swoosh says &#34;a team with a bunch of a-holes&#34;. Probably wouldn't have spent the money if I'd seen that. Like it enough to wear it anyway.
3.0,The zipper curled up after two washes making the jacket look very messy
3.0,The credit card slots are not sewn shut. Your cards will slide down in there and get stuck and you have to fiddle with it like crazy!
3.0,I like the top but I really didn’t like the fit of the pants
3.0,Beautiful piece.....v. strange clasp...cannot understand how to 'thread' chain onto clasp so as to ensure it won't fall off....it did once but I fortunately didn't lose it....any advice would be appreciated.<br />It really is a lovely piece of jewellery tho.
3.0,The dress was just ok...very thin material.  Runs on the large side.  Ended up returning it..just wasnt anything special.
3.0,"These are super cute but also SUPER FRAGILE. If they fall off your head kiss em goodbye because the lenses fall out and the metal parts break to pieces.<br /><br />Edit: I want so hard to give these five stars. The customer service is AMAZING but the glasses are incredibly fragile. Can’t withstand a 12” drop from a nightstand. They fit perfectly so I buy one pair a month, but this will be my last purchase as you have to treat them like glass."
3.0,Love it but was beat up when I received it .
3.0,"My granddaughter is not loving the fabric. She said they feel ""slippery "".  Probably won't get worn out."
3.0,"Well okay still have to try this product out but have to put 5 stars in order to get the warranty. Hoping it works just as good as the reviews and videos haha.<br /><br />EDIT: so first off not the best doesn’t exactly work I mean it does but for some strange reason keeps moving, can bend over in it, or what u wrap will move. I was picking up my dog a few time and the whole thing shifted, like came unraveled, did stay put and I did it tightly, did feel good on my back tho cus forced me to stand straight until I had to pick something up or bend over"
3.0,"The socks were of good quality, but the price was a bit elevated. I bought them because I needed them for a gift."
3.0,"Glad I only ordered one. While the item is cute, the word Princess on the goblet I received is not in a pretty purple color like it shows in the picture; it's a dark blue/black color and it really makes a difference."
3.0,"Cute dress, but runs small. I don't have a large chest and this was super tight. It was also so short that I had to wear leggings underneath. Maybe a bigger size would be better!"
3.0,"You’ll be disappointed if you’re expecting the feel of cashmere. Good stretch and wrist fit, knit fabric is pretty basic poly blend."
3.0,"This thing is huge. The small size that I bought can fill the semi-large man.<br />3 stars is because I can still wear it as a messy style (messy hair ...etc), lol, just trying to make the most of it, because I hate returning things."
3.0,"I really liked this shirt, but the sizing was super small, to the point I thought it must have been mislabeled. I purchased an XL. I typically wear a large or xl depending on the cut and style. This fit like a medium. I sent it back, and no xxl available or I would have tried one."
3.0,Hook thicker than pictured. The hook would not fit through watch stem loop. I had to improvise with a loop of fishing line to make it possible to hang watch on hook. Looks good now.
3.0,"It is a very pretty looking watch. The problem is that it has a big face.<br /><br />I should have measured it, if the measurements were posted? I checked through a lot of watches, and that one seemed to have a small face.<br /><br />The face was too big for my wrist. I like watches with small faces."
3.0,"Well made and is as described, except for the ""soft"" part. It's far from soft. Also, if you have one of those charging cradles where the watch is on its side, it may affect the ability to charge (my personal experience anyway). I stopped using it (I'm not returning it since it works as described and may come in handy if I ever have to fight a grizzly while wearing my watch)"
3.0,"This is warm, soft and thick but the fabric is kind of stiff. I find that it easily slips up/off and looks dumb. May work best for curly hair?"
3.0,This face mask run a little small and there is no nose adjuster. The fabric is soft and the eyeore picture is cute.
3.0,This works for a one time special event or for short term. It’s inexpensive and it feels it. Still cute though!
3.0,I like it but it's not<br />The greatest fit
3.0,I like the hoodie but shipping is bad. Super bad. The best kind of bad when you consider the price of the item. Shipping speed needs to be improved. That’s why 3 stars.
3.0,I wouldn't buy these again. Our family went skiing for the first time so we didn't want to spend too much yet. These served their purpose for my boys (age 10 and 12) but they did scratch and they are not truly comfortable. I purchased others for $20 each for myself and my toddler and ours were so much better. Don't recommend.
3.0,"The pants fabric is nice, lots of pockets and I like the blue color, but they have an odd fit and they’re too short. They’re just not for me. I prefer a regular fit and a longer inseam."
3.0,"Not as expected, maybe a bigger size would have been a better fit!"
3.0,"It certainly will protect your laptop.  I wasn't crazy about the not-exact color match between the case and the handle, and it's also heavier (obviously) than a soft case.  If you're tossing it into your car that's probably no big deal, but if you have to shlep it around on subways and buses, the extra weight is a minus."
3.0,not as pretty as it looks...
3.0,Clings in unflattering places
3.0,"Me quedó un poco corto, mido 1.70cm y soy bien delgada, el ancho esta justo y al poco uso el un cierre del bolsillo se dañó"
3.0,Quality fabric and very pretty design with slightly weak stitching. After 2 days wear there are micro-holes along the seams especially along the thumb. But i am pleased that they do not look costumey
3.0,"It was not how I expected. Since it doesn't have any supporting pads, you can consider to use for workout. But still nice"
3.0,"These glasses are OK. A bit on the larger bulky size if you have a narrow face, you will not like these. Albeit they do bend easy at the bridge to snug in a bit. The bows are too long and feel them in my helmet."
3.0,The strap does not hold much weight. Other than that its nice.
3.0,"Within 2 days, the stitching at the highest point of zipper started to unravel. The front had  stamped out flowers which went backwards so I could see the inside liner. If it ripped, would ruin the look.  I had bought a Nanette Leopor smaller bag during the 2019 spring/summer. Many compliments from other women. Great quality and looks like it will last forever. This larger handbag just was not  something I could recommend."
3.0,This dress was so pretty but it was too small for me so I returned it. Thanks Amazon!
3.0,Not the material I was expecting. Was looking for a sturdier material. This is VERY stretchy material so it droops heavily. Not flattering. Will be returning
3.0,"Stainless steel is not magnetic, and nickel is magnetic. These earrings were really irritating my ears and I wasn't sure why, so I tested them and found that the backings are magnetic, meaning they were more likely the culprit. When I use backings from different earrings it does not irritate my ears"
3.0,"The fit is fine, however the shirt is not nearly as long as I expected. If I was short it would be great. But I’m 5”10 and the top is a shorty! I will still wear it but not with leggings!!"
3.0,Only gave 3 stars because the picture on the shoes don't cover the whole front of the shoe (see pix). Was shipped in a manila envelope so they were squished when they arrived. If you only need them for quick slip on play shoes then this is the shoe for you.
3.0,"Wow - SUPER low cut. I fear exposure wearing these out of the house, but they are comfy for tv watching.  I was in between M and L so went for L, again, great for TV watching, perhaps a bit loose for normal wear. I was expecting these to fit a bit more like a yoga pant, but they ride lower than my string bikinis."
3.0,"Well made cap except the button is faulty and does not stay snapped. Otherwise, decent quality for the price."
3.0,"These boots are comfortable, and I can wear them all day. As far as looks I would say they are just okay. Good for casual wear. Not the best I’ve seen and certainly not the worst. For the cost they are a decent average combat boot."
3.0,Not that nice in person
3.0,"After two weeks of wearing the charm on my bracelet, it started to discolor (silver plating wearing off and a bronze color coming through). I probably won't be keeping this one on my bracelet."
3.0,The material is not like the real spandex sport leggins. This is more for be at home.
3.0,"they are nice for little girls, but too small for women."
3.0,"Fits perfect, great material, but i ordered a pink, white, and sky blue, and instead of sky blue i got a purple, that doesnt match any of the dresses i have and i ripped all the packaging...so now im stuck with it, no time to return and reorder and no money to order the right color. I really needed the sky blue one more than the others. Very disappointed."
3.0,Clunky and costume-y. That will be a no for me.
3.0,"I ordered a large, and it was a bit big. Prefect length but a bit too loose. The royal blue is perfect though and a year later and hasn't faded. But I think a medium would have sufficed"
3.0,I don't like the material over the neck...
3.0,"I really liked this skirt when it arrived. It's simple and plain, just what I was looking for. I slipped it on, but it wouldn't button (it lacked a quarter inch.) I was so upset. I hate that I have to return it. I will add that I did use the size chart and it still didn't fit."
3.0,Too yellow at night.
3.0,Do not put this in the washing machine they will fall apart.
3.0,They're ok for the price I guess
3.0,Much looser fitting. Felt like mens short
3.0,"This swimming suit is OKAY. I ordered a couple sizes up and it was a little big. Had to do some alterations. One of those alterations was adding a BRA!! There is ZERO support. I'm a 42 DD, I need some support.  It also only lasted me one summer. Both sides under the armpit ripped/spit."
3.0,"The shirt is made nicely, however the straps on the pants fell apart within 1 hour of use."
3.0,Cute but too big around my wrist
3.0,Fogged up pretty quickly
3.0,"Trying to read the small print that describes the show you are checking out on a network tv show on a 42"" tv, sitting about 8 feet back.  Tried the -0.50 and the -1.00  one was too weak, the other too strong.  Not a problem with the glasses.  Expect I need a prescription.  Will return both pairs and see my eye doctor.  The picture was stronger with both pairs, but the print was not.  Expect that's what they mean in the description when they say they are not reading glasses.  Does not work for distances."
3.0,"I bought a LG because it's cotton, but the pants are for someone 6 foot ! Will have to hem it."
3.0,"These keep my hands somewhat warm without being too bulky so that I can still move them, but the elastic around the wrists isn't tight enough. I wouldn't wear them for prolonged cold weather exposure, but running errands in the car they hold up alright, or for early spring/late fall use is ok."
3.0,"Fit normal, they are comfortable and are great for layering but I wouldn't call them compression."
3.0,Pendant can slip off easily
3.0,"Stopped working shortly after first winding.,  Get it for aesthetic enjoyment (it looks really Steampunk Cool!), not as a dependable timepiece."
3.0,Love the saying. Keychain keeps falling off of keyring.  Not using now due to fear of losing it
3.0,Griffendor not readable.  Can you replace that pair?
3.0,"Fit too snug for xx-large, good traction but a bit small"
3.0,One side of the tunnel is open it is not all the way through. Also the skin tones alittle funnyish. Thats it.
3.0,more colorful in the picture than life.  Took forever to arrive.
3.0,The bottle holder is not bug enough for most water bottles.
3.0,"Hat was was too big. When I tightened it to fit my head, the straps in back was way too loose."
3.0,"It was a gift so not sure if the person I gave it to likes it or not.<br />It was smaller than I expected, but a good buy I think."
3.0,"It doesn't fit well, rather loose and the zipper is difficult to zip up and vice versa."
3.0,I ordered size 4 and it was big for my daughter .<br /><br />Order 1 size down .
3.0,"Color is a bit off, these are burgundy but still a nice color. They do fit pretty snug. I would be much happier with them if they would stay up better."
3.0,I've been using a couple of cheepo pieces that are rated at less than 30X and they are much better than these so called 30X loupes.  Don't be fooled by the claim of 30X.  I thought buying the new 30X pieces would improve the magnification but I was mistaken.
3.0,Not as soft as I had hoped.
3.0,"These shades come very well packaged. Nice box with sufficient protective coverings. Good quality and pleasing to the eye. OMG are they LARGE. The adverts do not even come close to the actual size you'll receive. So now I am looking for someone to gift it to with a fat head. Not just the lenses but the arms as well. Still, very nice product."
3.0,"This was recommended as a purchase with a Bible, so I thought that would be a good protector and cove for the Bible. Not so. it is much smaller than the bible it was paired with. So I have a nice cover that will not fit Bible it was purchased for."
3.0,"a nicer alternative to my plastic all purpose Casio outdoor watch. I like the wrap style band, a little different than what you normally see. The band uses a sliding knot to adjust and close, but it is still too big for my small-average  wrist size.  I am considering replacing it with a toggle closure. Granted, the watch itself may not hold up long, but it would be easy to replace since it just slides on to the band."
3.0,"I like the darkness and the large lenses, but the glasses are too big across the frame and don’t stay on my face"
3.0,The hat itself was fine. It was sent in an envelope and was very smashed. Always received hats in a box previously.
3.0,Nice leather purse. Good amount of inside pockets. The outside flap should have a magnetic closure as weaving it through the buckle is not easy. I'm already having problems with the outside back zipper and I've only had this purse 1 day. I was surprised that the interior fabric is brown and not moss green as shown in the picture. The brown leather color is very similar to the picture. Overall a good purse just not of the best quality.
3.0,A little large and overall ok. Color is as shown.
3.0,I wish this would have worked out for me. I couldn't even get the dress over my shoulders. I am a bligger girl so I bought an XXL which was my size. My suggestion is but a size up from your normal size. If it was bigger the dress would have fit.
3.0,"I absolutely adored these. Only complaint/problem was part of the daughter keychain. Unfortunately the ""no matter where"" charm is a bit bubbled and nicked. also has a few lil brown spots.. I’m sure I was probably just lucky and got a faulty charm. Because everything else is beautiful and nicely put together. Can’t really see the bubles in the mobile picture more as in person. I also tried to polish it with a special rag but that doesnt help at all. Otherwise I wouldve gave a 5/5 stars."
3.0,Cheaply made for a Hockey Jersey. Is more like a summer shirt / Football Jersey fabric. Its so thin. The Kooy Jerseys are far better as practice jerseys even if it doesn't look correct. This Jersey would be great if the material was thicker.
3.0,I love the looks of it but the it not that soft and kinda hot it's good for winter i think
3.0,"Cute hat but not sure what age it will work for. Too kidish for me, so i tried to give to my 13 year old nieces, they both said to babyish for them, so my 4 year old claimed it. She loves it, but of coarse it is too big for her head!"
3.0,"Runs really small (ordered up one size and wished I had ordered up 2) and is not a traditional hoodie thickness. It’s more like the equivalent of a Jersey pullover and the material seems cheap. However, the graphics are stunning. Would be good for raving/festivals, but not to get you through the winter with any kind of regular use."
3.0,"Cost, gave them as a gift."
3.0,"This shirt is what I needed for a Halloween costume that I am making. I ordered the XL and it fit fine. It does have a lot of stretch on it, which I really liked. The shirt is VERY see through though, but I am putting shells on that area so it's not a big deal. Shirt came very fast, I was very happy with the purchase, I was afraid because I am not stick thin that this shirty wouldn't look right on me, but I like how it fits, it is long enough to just show a little skin with a high waisted skirt."
3.0,"The material and quality was nice. The size was off, too small."
3.0,loved the pockets and the dress but the bust was way to tight
3.0,Cute but too big for my Yorkie
3.0,"I can tell it's cheaply made as the handles are on the INSIDE of the bag, preventing it from zipping shut all the way.  Kind of retarded, but I guess since I don't plan on turning my bag upside down while carrying it, I don't have to worry about anything falling out (i.e. pencils, pens, tracker mouse, etc).  The design printed on it is beautiful but the zipper issue stops me from giving it any more stars."
3.0,Easy to snag on when putting on fell like your feet slide around in shoe like a dress sock when sweating
3.0,They cute but they are high rise.  I may keep them and wear them unbuttoned with the waist folded down.  I'm short waisted so I do not wear high rise pants. Creates a huge muffin top.
3.0,"I went by the size chart on the listing for this.. and it was incorrect. I ordered the size that’s listed for 4 inches, which was size 5 toddler. And normally, my 4 year old is in a size 10 toddler shoe. But, because I followed what they said to do, I measured her foot just like they recommend, and her foot is a little over 4 in.. so I got the size 5 toddler because that’s what is listed for that measurement. I received the shoes, and I love them, but, the size is like for a 2 year old. There’s no way lol. So, I have to now return them and I guess order a toddler 10, even though her foot isn’t 6in like the chart says for a size toddler 10🤦‍♀️<br />Not sure if I misunderstood that or what 🤔"
3.0,"My daughters school colors are Black, White and Orange... So for Basketball, we thought these sneakers would be ideal... Unfortunately this color is more of a brick color rather than orange, therefore the 3 stars... Had I had more time before the beginning of Basketball, I would've sent them back but..."
3.0,I would say they are more bug like than  cat like.  They are very exaggerated the colors are great .
3.0,"Love my glasses and the lenses, but this set I ordered came scratched. Oh well..."
3.0,"They do travel up and with a real short leg design it can get aggravating. Waited until this long, I wear them guide a lot. I would not buy again"
3.0,Good. Comes with a smell so need to wash or air out for a while.
3.0,"Looks just like the picture, but you can see the glue and some of the lace is coming away from the headband"
3.0,The bracelet itself is very beautiful and I'm satisfied with the colors and the stye/look of it. My only problem was that 3 days after wearing it the eye of the tiger pendant broke off. It's actually made of some cheap plastic and not metal like I had hoped it would be. I was lucky to have another pendant from a chain that had broken. It's the molecular structure for caffeine and it looks great on the bracelet and I get a lot of compliments on it. It's a great looking bracelet but my only complaint is the cheap plastic that the pendant is made out of.
3.0,This top is cute on & I received compliments while wearing it.  The white isn't a true white but a light cream color with a shiny tinge.  Still cute enough to keep. I would give the 4th star for a true white.
3.0,The boots are really nice but the fit is too tight-fitting. I got my usual size (8) and feels like a 7. Will be returning.
3.0,It wasnt bad from waist up but. .Material- thin  not see through ( I got in black) but hugs EVERYTHING (curves and valleys included) I'm a shmedium (bet small/medium) and it's just a tad too fitted for my liking.
3.0,"Looks great kids like them, good value  but 1 buckle broke. 3 yr old figured the buckle mechanism"
3.0,This coat looks great except the bicep area is made a bit tight for a 2X. If the arms were a little bigger I would use this as my only jacket/coat for Autumn/Winter. I can wear a blouse under this no probably but wearing a sweater....nope. Too bulky to fit in this.
3.0,"I really like these charms.  They have designs on both sides (a rarity) nice size, perfect for my projects.  I could not give this the five star rating that I wanted as two of the charms did not have the loop to insert a jump ring through making them impossible to use.  They are basically coins.  Pleased but disappointed also."
3.0,the price reflect the quality.  if you are looking for something cute and doesnt cost much .  this is it.  I bought a medium and washed and it shrunk to a small.  material is very thin.  BUT  price is good for the quality.  If you are looking for forever 21 fashion and prices.  this is  your dress
3.0,"I typically wear a size US size 14/16 and after looking over the sizing chart and reading reviews about how this dress runs extremely small I went with with a XXL. The actual fit of the dress was perfect - not too tight and not too loose. I would have given 5 stars, but I'm 5'11 and the sewn in belt that should be right at my waist comes across my chest instead. This material doesn't have any stretch or give at all, so there's no way for me to pull or manipulate the waistline down to where it should be. I really had my heart set on wearing this dress to a conference this weekend, so I've ordered another dress (and paid extra for one day shipping) in a larger size to see if the proportions are better."
3.0,Very nicely finished but the engraving is very light and hard to see
3.0,For a smaller framed woman order down a size from what it recommends. Other than that it’s a great quality and feels great.
3.0,"The designs on these are great but unfortunately, if your foot is on the larger size, they don't fit. These run quite small but if you have a very petite foot than these are for you. They seem durable and well made as far as comfort goes, I don't know because I was unable to wear them."
3.0,"They are a slinky material, but are soft."
3.0,Really cute dress and fits well but I could have gone down a size.y biggest issue with the dress is multiple rips right on the seams. I’m not sure if it came that way or happened after one wear for a couple hours but they seem to be pretty fragile
3.0,Stretches easily and doesn't shrink back to original size like other chokers I've had. Now it's too loose to wear.
3.0,"Was so excited to receive these, but when I tell you the names shown in small print are barely visible on most of them... understatement! So bummed! Nice quality itself, but disappointed overall with this one."
3.0,The material of this dress seemed a little cheap.  I usually am very happy with the dresses I get through Amazon.  This one was not a winner.  We returned it in favor of another dress.
3.0,Really cute but really small. The round one doesn’t even fit on my septum. And since it’s so small the one with the diamonds is so hard to click closed while you’re wearing it but it’s really nice once you get it closed. The one with the balls is also tiny but I still like it for when I don’t want my septum ring to be that noticeable.
3.0,"While I love the style of these pants, they were really too small, and not as long as I had expected they would be."
3.0,"This is ok. It is White and I guess I expected it to be more of a material that would not be as see through. I did not end up wearing it for the White out party on the cruise due to that, but I will use it this summer."
3.0,This is great material but I did not know it was stretchy material. It's is very comfy but does run a bit small!
3.0,"The design of these pants is really cute, but the materials and workmanship are poor.  The threads used are black, and inside the garment looks a mess.  The fabric IS VERY soft, and I love the hippie vibe, I just wish they were a bit better quality.  My daughter is 9, and really likes these regardless.  They was well, and there was no piling of the fabric, just some loose threads on the inside."
3.0,"This is a very nice suit, just not for me!"
3.0,"These arrived on time, but within 2 days of using the first pair, t he  inner cotton lining bunch up and I couldn't put  my right hand  in the glove.  I threw them away"
3.0,It was very cute but the shoulders had no give at all. Fit everywhere but there
3.0,"It fits and covers my entire leg since I'm only 4'11.  Laying it flat on my bed without stretching it, it is NOT 39 inches.  It is about 32-33 inches.  Maybe if you stretch it out then it could reach 39 inches, but I don't see how it'll stay without anything holding or tying it.  It is a little loose since my legs are thinner than the average.  Trying it on, it doesn't slide down my legs.  However, I am a little concerned about the sliding if I wear it out.  I might have to wear upside down since the bottom is tighter.  I do not have any other leg warmers so I cannot compare but it seems decent for the price.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATE 4/20/2018<br /><br />I wore it out today and it definitely slid down right away.  My legs are just too thin for this.  I came back home and put the tighter end to my thighs instead but it still slid down.  Standing still it doesn't slide so I thought it was good.  I'm not sure what to do now.  Maybe give it to my sister since her legs are more average size."
3.0,This mess I bought it because I felt it can help me I work at a college what a bunch of kids issue with it the foam filter is keep falling out not sure if that filter is for small particles otherwise if it was I would give it a 4 And that’s only because the rubber keep popping out my ear going to send it back
3.0,"Felt confident first time wore. Snug in all the right areas! Thinking to get a second one, though after washing once it now looks very worn and has some pill to it. Not pleased. On fence to order another."
3.0,very pretty but quality is a little iffy
3.0,"It was really pretty, but the arm area was a bit tight."
3.0,"These were comfortable, but a bit small.  I ordered Mens size thinking they would be roomier on my wide feet."
3.0,They are not correctly sized.
3.0,"I read the reviews in advance and a common complaint was there was not any real differentiation in the color like shown in the picture. The brown legwarmers that I received were beautifully packaged in a box, and look like really good quality, however there’s a slightly darker brown at the top and then the rest just blends together. (Not 3 progressively lighter shades of brown.)  They also run rather narrow which is fine for me because I have really skinny legs but I don’t think they would fit someone with average to larger calves."
3.0,It was an okay purchase. Would not buy again. Very very thin material. Maybe darker colts are better.
3.0,I didn't like how thin and see thru they were.
3.0,Ankle socks would suit me better. I wasn't a fan of the sand that sneaks in by my ankles.
3.0,"I was honestly kind of disappointed.. I looked at a lot of the reviews and had high expectations. The material and everything wasn't as legit as I thought it was going to be.. plus there were tiny dead ants scattered here and there which was really gross. Despite all this though, the headdress was still badass. Better than the ones you can buy from any Halloween store but I wouldn't buy if you're looking for a really legit one."
3.0,Arrived fast.  Jen’s are smaller than photo represents.
3.0,"This is my third pair of these same sunglasses. These fit differently some how, they are not as comfortable as my other two pairs that I bought at the coach store."
3.0,So comfortable but a bear to get fastened!
3.0,"Headband looks great on, but my daughter has only worn it once and the stitching is already coming undone."
3.0,Came on time and looks just like the picture. I didn't like that the straps of the bag were snagged already. I will not waste my time returning it because I'm gonna use it for something private anyway. Next time though I will never purchase a bag off Amazon and instead go to Ross.
3.0,"Super cute, but too heavy.  The weight makes them bounce out of the holes and fall to the floor :(<br />Good to wear if sitting at your computer"
3.0,"These are thinner, and don't have the characteristics of wool or rabbit, as it says in the description."
3.0,"Great pants if your in between sizes. Spanx makes fairly good shape wear but it’s been hit and miss for me with spanx and if you order direct, customer service is awful! They prefer to push you back online. Very frustrating.  So, if your looking for the lessser evil, order here and try for yourself."
3.0,Nice band but they sent the wrong clasp. Ordered gold they sent silver.
3.0,"Handsome looking watch, Bracelet too big and difficult to make smaller.<br />Digital date and time difficult to see in daylight."
3.0,It arrived and looks as pictured. The material is soft. It doesn’t feel cheap. I generally do not get clothing with prints that are painted on so I decided to return. It’s inexpensive so it probably won’t be a poor purchase for anyone who generally wears clothing with designs printed onto them.
3.0,"I read all the reviews and when I got these I thought they were better than the reviews. However, after wearing them a couple of times i noticed that the waist has less stretch but the rest of thenshorts didn't hold their shape as well as I expected. They quickly got a little stretched out in the leg. They can still be worn, but they are not my preferred shorts."
3.0,This bathing suit is cute and shown as pictured. I ordered a size large because I noticed this item was coming from China. The bottoms were very small fitting and I usually where a size 4-6 in women's clothing; so a size small or medium would be my normal size. The bottoms are cut very high so your buns are showing. The top is true to size in my option since it was rather loose for me and my size breasts didn't fill the cups. SIZE B. Overall the sizing of this suit is way off and unless you are super small and have large breasts this suit will not work for you. The suit is bright and colorful and seems to be well made. I liked the material and colors but the size is way off.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange of my honest review. The fact that I received this product at a discount does not affect the rating I gave it because I understand how important reviews are when purchasing a product. If this review helped you. Please click yes.
3.0,"I ordered the pajamas because they were purple and looked cozy. I ordered large (I’m 5 ft 7 and 177 lbs). That size usually fits pretty good. The top fit nicely and was definitely cozy. The bottoms are short, too short.  I kept them because I could wear long fuzzy socks but would really like to have had the pants longer, ankle length with the waist fitting at the waist. If you have short legs these would be great, but mine aren’t. The rating is based on the warmth and coziness factors."
3.0,Super soft and not see through. However they didn't last long before getting several small holes.
3.0,"First of all let me say that these beads are beautiful and except for the pair in the second picture, which are acrylic, all beads are glass. Which is why it is a shame that only a very few have single core grommets, and one of those was broken (third picture.) I mainly bought the set for the pair of beads that appear to be simulated turquoise stone (fourth picture,) as this is my birth stone; and they even have silver grommets, though not single core. The last few pictures are close ups of the beads, as anyone can see the designs a lovely; it's just a shame about using shoelace grommets in the place of proper single core bead/ jewelry grommets, I even received a pair of beads with no grommets at all (final photo.)"
3.0,The earrings are HUGE! The 1&#34; advertised is from good to back... From head to tail these are 4&#34;!
3.0,"Fit is huge. I’m 120lbs, 5’4” and the small was huge on me"
3.0,"Beautiful but... it's a much darker grey then in the picture and barely any purple. Also, it doesn't sparkle as much as in the picture unless it's caught by the sun... I wish I would have gone with a different color, but overall it's nice for the price."
3.0,"The bra part where the bow tie is, is very loose. There isn't much support there but the bottom half is very cute and fits great."
3.0,Super cute but too tight on the bust. The shirt has zero stretch which was an issue for me. Other than that it’s super cute!
3.0,They are very thin and transparent.  They are ok.
3.0,"I do like this piece. It's pretty, and the pinks are beautiful and soft. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the white pieces sticking out from the head to fall off. I do have small ears, and because of how much you can adjust this, I found it was easy to make it fit.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this piece. I have no regrets buying it, but due to parts of it falling off I feel it deserves an 'average' score."
3.0,A bit smaller than expected. I wish the said the size in inches as well as centimeters. Too small for what I wanted it for.
3.0,Somewhat small. Fits someone who is 5' 4&#34; and 110 pounds.
3.0,They were too small. I couldn't get them to close.
3.0,Bought a size 3x but it was more like a size medium.
3.0,Wanted light eyeglass holders--needed 2 as I have 2 pairs of glasses I always carry.  They are a little bit bigger than I wanted (my fault--the 1/2-3/4 inch more made a big difference) but most annoyingly they are really hard to open.  Going to look for another set of cases.
3.0,I ordered a 3x (my size) but it didn't fit. Other reviews said to order your normal size but I suggest you size up 1-2 sizes.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but the top had a hard time staying up. I even sized down, but still had the same problem."
3.0,Perfect for my daughter's Sonic birthday party but I'm glad I sized up. She had a pair of leggings that looked cute with it so she pulled it off but it was above her knees.
3.0,The color is very pretty. The case comes up on the side often like if it a little too small for it
3.0,These were snug to the point of discomfort. I would not recommend for those with thick calves.
3.0,"Quality is poor, not like photo, odd Proportions and runs Very large."
3.0,It's short in the front longer in the back. The material is a cheap polyester. Not terrible but not my favorite purchase
3.0,I like the look & design but it's too small for my size 8 head.
3.0,They run small.. they are super tight.. And I paid $49 for nothing more than pricey croc’s shoes.. I wish I could send them back🥲
3.0,These boots are awesome but they need to size them better..
3.0,"It is polyester, and I am usually fine wearing this material.  Definitely a little bit uncomfortable to wear it, but on the other hand I received so many compliments. So, it deserves 4 stars"
3.0,"It looks like I purchased these sometime at the end September of 2018 and installed in early October 2018, and one BROKE! (May 2019) while supporting my kayak and gear (far less than 100lbs.) while it was being raised very slowly with a hand winch AND support guidance to it's overhead storage position. The sudden break put the person helping guide the boat in danger of injury, and resulted in the boat (and gear) crashing down to a concrete floor! The buckle actually BROKE! on the male end where the flat webbing was threaded through the plastic bar (the bar completely severed from both sides!!)! The slide clip remained fastened during the entire ordeal, BUT it doesn't help much when the buckle BREAKS!. This buckle had NOT been abused or mishandled in anyway as it was a relatively new install and is out of harms way being in overhead storage. I do NOT recommend this product for any application where it needs to be relied on for durability. The quality is just not there, and because of this it could catastrophically fail without warning resulting in damage, injury or worse."
3.0,Really thought it was cool but it just fell apart in two months.
3.0,"I thought they would be shell, but there plastic"
3.0,"I'm 5'8"", 42C, 185 lbs.  The 2X was none too big but fit smoothly.  This would be great with a pair of leggings but does run a bit sheer so I will wear a contrasting camisole underneath.  The back completely covered my  rear end and the front was a bit shorter which I find attractive.  I would estimate that most ladies will need  to go up at least one size.  All in all, its pretty good for the price if you can find your correct size."
3.0,This is a beautiful brooch pin.  Unfortunately it was not properly packaged when shipped.  Item was placed in a regular amazon bag and it was received already broken.  It should of been placed in a small box for protection when being shipped.
3.0,not that great.. liked the ones from amazon basics
3.0,"Very cute. Grey is slightly see through and you should dry clean or it will develop &#34;sweater fuzz&#34;. But it fits well, I'm 5'6, 180lbs with a small waist and large thighs. It complements my shape by hugging my waist and flaring just below my waistline (so it won't hide a pouch on our bloated days). I need a short heel so it doesn't touch the floor. I give it three stars because I bought two and the stitch around the zipper of one is loose after two washes and wears.  But i still love the dress, especially the length and it did lose shape or length after i washed it."
3.0,I have very thin wrists and could not get a firm latch for my Fitbit.
3.0,Packaging and case are nice...
3.0,Really satin like material.  Not what was expected.
3.0,Too dark.  They look black once worn.  I was hoping they would be brighter.
3.0,"Cute but poorly made.  Started to fell s as part after just one wash,"
3.0,"Most pairs were wonderful, but 2 pairs were not clip ons and were for only pierced ears."
3.0,El precio es muy elevado para la calidad de este articulo. El precio esta triplicado .
3.0,"Wish it was a bit longer, Beautiful though."
3.0,Looks good but too tight.... Sorry
3.0,The fit funky.
3.0,I got these a few weeks back to replace my older ones bought a year or so back. These are odd sized. One pair come up to just over my calf. The other pair come up and covers my kneecap. I’m average height and have never seen socks that cover your knee.
3.0,I looked at the model in the product pic and was like dang okay that looks pretty cool...then I remembered I wasn’t white so I claim these pics to be misleading
3.0,"If your arm are heavy or some muscle, don't get it."
3.0,"... but I'm keeping mine because the shape of the mask makes it easier to breathe. I can't imagine men could wear this ""One Size Unisex""."
3.0,"Love the purse but when I got it, it had a scratch!!!!! Really 120$ and I have a scratch on it. I bought a NEW mk bag not used!!!! Wtf"
3.0,"The stone is perfect however the chain is useless because there is nothing to latch it on to, the links are small so the latch doesn’t go into it."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress!  The fit is perfect, really flattering!  But I missed the tiny print about the dress being &#34;somewhat sheer to make you sexy&#34;....uh....this dress is fully see through.  I wouldn't wear it unless you plan on wearing a bathing suit underneath."
3.0,"I'm not sure how the other two are, but the first pair had worn out crotch area--don't know if it's a defect or if the moths got to them. The rest of it seems thick and sturdy. Will have to see how the other two are."
3.0,"Was expecting to receive a new watch, but ended up with a used product. Happy with the watch and disappointed with the distributor."
3.0,"Love the earrings, but the colors were a li too bold for me"
3.0,"I like the look and feel of these sunglasses. What I don’t like is the blue visor offers almost no shading, darkening of your surroundings. These are more for looks than actual sunglasses. I haven’t tried the other lenses because I really just bought for the blue lenses. Maybe I’ll try the black, even though it ruins the cool look."
3.0,It's ok. Exact fit but the straps were digging into my toes. Would return on Monday.
3.0,"Shipping was great<br />I just open the package.  I wasn't expecting the best or the worse, if it didnt have a zipper id probably take them back. It looks like a dull trash bag but the material isn't as thin.<br />I wear a size 10 in pants so I ordered the large. Im 5'6 and the fact that I have a booty didnt help.<br />They dont look bad but the crotch is kind of low. I think its suppose to be high wasted but my booty took all the room. They fit real snug so do not size down. I may or may not try to get a refund but I've seen worse faux leggings. My advice would be to buy faux leather pants"
3.0,It was cute in theory but it didn't really fit my physique too well :(
3.0,"One pair was broken, but the other pair is in great condition and is such a good fit, I did not want to return them.  I have to admit I wished they were a little bit larger, but I'm still very happy with the pair that I  have."
3.0,it’s comfy but the color is not yellow. if ur kinda pale like me it’ll look like ur not wearing anything at all.
3.0,Thick and warm if you like bulky. Fingers are a little short.
3.0,"Loved the fashion, but waist was too small. Better if waist was expandable."
3.0,Ultra thin material and runs on the small side. This dress would be good with a swim suite or bikini under it.
3.0,This romper looks good but as soon as I received it the button came off. For something that is $20+ it shouldn’t come so easily off especially brand new.
3.0,skip these
3.0,I’m obsessed with watch bands for my Apple Watch. I loved the design on this band it was more unusual than others on Amazon. Two things I don’t like : the band is a bit thinner than my older bands and it feels a bit on the cheaper side AND I def don’t like the loop on the band you tuck in the excess strap. If you put your wrist down it begins to dig into your skin. The pattern itself is well done. The colors are nice and it’s very stylish looking. As far as durability we shall see. It wasn’t a huge amount of money so I really don’t expect a lot. For however long it lasts I’ll enjoy it and if it lasts a long time …even better
3.0,The flower is HUGE! Looked awkward on my small petite frame/tummy. Had to give it away to a friend. At least she loved it.
3.0,"I didn't realize how formfitting the dress is until I received it! I expected it to be more of a loose fit, but the material definitely clings to the body. It is a flattering shape and the scallop hems are my favorite part. Material-wise expect sort of like a spandex or a costume material- something with stretch. If you want the shape the model has, size up. If you want a formfitting dress, stick to your regular size."
3.0,Love the design but it's too big I'll need to alter the straps so it fits a little better
3.0,"Been using one for the last few months, I work overseas so I am required to carry my passport with me at all times, the lining is already coming apart.  I only keep my passport, cash and three cards in so its not from over stuffing it. The leather is holding up well its just the lining in the pockets that is coming apart.  Besides that it fits well in my pocket and protects my passport."
3.0,Mask looks exactly like the picture. I was hoping for a more stable material but for the price it was fine. Thin plastic. The danglet pieces on the side came off but are just tied on so not a huge issue to fix. Great party mask for kids!
3.0,The suit was cute but not long enough. I don't have a long torso or anything but it reall rode up. I returned this suit and found another.
3.0,It was loose in the crotch area so it sagged a bit not noticeably but i didnt care for it considering its a jumpsuit. For me if im going to wear a romper/jumsuit/one piece wte you want to call it i want it to be tight and fitting it was not and i got a small i normally wear a medium. The fabric is nice and thick stretchy material so thats awesome especially for thw price. Overall its nice just too loose for my liking and again its NOT noticeable i just dont care for it.
3.0,"The material is pretty thin, but they look nice on."
3.0,"I like it, but,<br />I’m just very upset, upon arrival 3 of the gems were in the bag(they had fallen out of the clasps.) And one is missing."
3.0,I don't think I'll use this- not what I had expected. Not my style
3.0,"It is extremely soft!! I’m a little disappointed because it runs pretty small and it shows every panty line. I’m a true M and I would definitely size up. It’s also too short for me to wear to work, but I don’t think I’ll return it."
3.0,"Purchased this for my daughter. She looks beautiful in it. The dress came in a different beading pattern than what is shown, but it's still pretty. The top needed to be taken in other than that great fit!"
3.0,"The measurements provided are literally off by 5+ inches per dimension, including bust, waist, hips and even length. It was crazy big and oddly long (and I’m almost 5’10” and it was tea length). I buy a large to fit my 36 DD bust, especially for fashion made in China; the rest of me is small. So while I expected there to be a little extra room, it should not have been that much larger than the stated measurements."
3.0,"It’s decent enough, but was way too small to hold my check books, straws, etc."
3.0,"This product DOES NOT block RFID. If you have a badge that you have to wave in front of a door sensor for work, then you can use that to test it yourself - that's using RFID. I've been scanning my door badge for multiple sites without opening the wallet for a while now. Disappointed at that outright failure, as that was a major selling point. I'm not interested in the &#34;sometimes kinda may hamper scanning&#34;. Either it blocks or it's useless for that purpose.<br /><br />As a wallet, it's moderately well built and has been functional. A bit bulky if you're used to money clips, or the like. The money strap works well, though, as it has a rubberized patch right under it. This creates solid friction on the bills or paper you slip under the band."
3.0,The waistband it a good fit. Normally I wear between S/M. The short fabric is what makes this awkward. It poofs out around the hips exaggerating your shape but not in a good or sexy way. Makes me look larger than what I am. Kinda dissapointed with the product.
3.0,Running too small.
3.0,"I wear an 8.5 in women’s shoes, ordered medium and they fit fine. The bottoms are suuuuuuuuper thin, but I think they will be fine for my trip to Hawaii snorkel cruise. For $5 i can wear them once and toss them."
3.0,"Reeealllyyy short. Basically a long, awkward shirt. Maybe would fit if I got an XL, but thats too frumpy. If you want THIS dress, get it from fashion nova."
3.0,"My daughter loves it & wears it everyday.  Unfortunately, it has tarnished very quickly. Only had it 2 weeks."
3.0,"Very small n size. I wear a size 38 (or XL) normally and the XXL on these won't even close! Be ware, go up 2 sizes!! Very dissapointed."
3.0,"While the leather was nice, the case is too large compared to my old, worn out one.  It will be difficult to fit in smaller purses."
3.0,These are cool looking but kinda cheap in person.  I ended up not really wearing them because they just don't feel very solid.  Wasn't expecting much but they could have been a little nicer.
3.0,"Not the item pictured. This seams like an O.K. strap and has a great price, however, though it may have some cotton in it, it definitely has nylon in it as well. It is marked with a Fender logo on the leather, when the the description clearly says it won't have any logos. Unfortunately, this is not going to meet my needs for the period instrument I was hoping to use it for, as it has too modern a look."
3.0,"Not as heavy as it looks. Even demin is usually heavy, but this is light weight. I ordered this in the beginning of Nov and just got it January 8th."
3.0,Saw these on the models and thought they looked cute. They're kind of heavy and big so I don't wear them very often.
3.0,Packed too tightly for easy access
3.0,Second time wearing and the grommet came out..
3.0,"The design of these pants is very cute.  However, I've purchased other Aventura pants (Arden) and they have some stretch to them, especially in the tummy area.  These do not have any at all so they fit much smaller on me.  They are also cut a little bit lower than other Aventura pants I've ordered. Unfortunately, I had to return."
3.0,"I just received this today, and will say, it looks exactly like it does in the pictures. I've never in my life tried on a dress that was so long! The material, though very thin, is wonderfully soft and kind of slinky. I got it in XL as I didn't want anything accentuating my bulges....I mean curves, ofc.  I'd love to wear it with a belt, but am still looking for my waist while shedding excess pounds. A long necklace will look great with this dress. If you look at all the pics, though, you'll see even the model is having trouble with the excess length. I'll probably keep it. If you buy one and come up with an easy and attractive way to handle the length, please let me know. I don't want to wear high heels in this or anything else as my high heel days are gone and I no longer have a sewing machine."
3.0,They are smaller than I thought they would be.  But workable.
3.0,I previously purchased this same fabric/print in 0-3 and it fit my boy into month 4. I purchased this in 6-9 and I can’t even get his 7 month old legs into it. Super annoying and inconsistent sizing!
3.0,Hem was crooked.
3.0,Uncomfortable to wear. Rough edges
3.0,Had it for about 3 weeks and the head broke off and i don't even know how.. but it was so beautiful I fell in love with it when I got it.. I'm probably going to order another one because the price isn't bad
3.0,"It’s a nice dress, but mine came already worn by someone. It had some stains on the front. I didn’t return as I wanted to wear it for the event I was planning to go to."
3.0,"This sunglasses case is a good form of protection for your Prada glasses however as it wears the magnet that is used to close the top will begin to demagnetize. In addition, the materials the case is made of are easily bendable and therefore you need to be careful not to sit on the case or place heavy objects on top of it."
3.0,"a handful of the attached loops have fallen off with little to no pressure (I'm just looping flexible connectors!)<br />I'm worried for the longevity. of these items. they look nice, but it won't look nice if they are that prone to damage rendering them useless."
3.0,Good comfortable fit
3.0,"Color is a dark blue and not the sapphire blue pictured.  Doesn't pick up the light the way the picture on Amazon.  Still,  it's pretty."
3.0,Nice color and style but runs very small for women size
3.0,"I liked the shoes but they are small, no information as to how to return them."
3.0,I only have issue with neck area where the buttons meet at top one side has about half inch more material very visable so I just wear it around the house when I am cleaning. I was going to take it on vacation not now though. I also ordered this shirt in brown and it is good to go on vacation.
3.0,"If you're looking at the wood sunglasses with blue lens, just know the description is wrong. It says matte black frame.. but it is NOT matte.. it is glossy."
3.0,"Great concept but the materials the bib is made of isn't user friendly as it's hot and sweat inducing, and just felt icky on skin. That's the feedback I was given when I tried to use it on my patient. I hope our experience was rare and others liked it. Good luck!"
3.0,way to small ordered 1X is like a junior XS
3.0,This wedding band is beautfil BUT the color is off. It looks &#34;fake&#34;.
3.0,"OK for the price I guess, but I've never felt 100% cotton that was this scratchy. I hope washing it multiple times with fabric softener will help, but some 100% cotton t-shirts are soft even before being washed. Might have something to do with where it's made."
3.0,Overall the dress was cute and I would recommend.  Purchased for junior high school dance. Excuse the awkwardness of the black undershirt. The nude lace that clearly does not match my daughters skin tone had to be covered hence the cami and she had to much cleavge showing. The only issue was the corset lacing in the back we couldn't quite figure it out which left a lot of the ribbon hanging. The satin jacket was also purchased on Amazon and it matches perfectly. The sleeves were creased and it did make them look very pointed and square at the wrist and the cleaners did not press it out llike I asked.
3.0,"Material is scratchy, if you have sensitive skin on the bottom of your wrist it'll get irritated real quick.<br />Its almost like a nylon backpack material.<br /><br />Also the metal pin locks where you use your thumb to push them in are too long and stretch outside the plastic housing."
3.0,"Dress was beautiful but even though I went up a size, it was still too small. I would have needed to go up three sizes, which they did not have. Unfortunately I had to return it."
3.0,"size was made for babies- I did not see that when ordered,also not so well made for a child since  it is a thinner slipper."
3.0,The out fit is cute and well made. My problem was the top was too small and pants too big. I'm 5'5 150lbs 36C and size 7jeans. I got a small but it fit me so weird. So I returned it.
3.0,ordered but Amazon vaguely cancelled the order along with another item.
3.0,"I loved these for like 3weeks,  then every part ripped on the inseam."
3.0,"The size runs smaller then expected, trying to return but they only want to give me a 20% refund and not return the product. The dress is pretty and soft. Still would like the product but in a larger size."
3.0,Very pretty just a little big
3.0,"Shipping was amazingly fast!  I paid for standard mail and got my package within a couple days. This charm is exactly how it looks, but it is very tiny.  How tiny is tiny?  It is as big as the nail bed of my pinky finger.  Seriously."
3.0,"It is okay, but the bow was wrinkled and would not attach to dress so I just took it off, and the pattern was completely different than what was pictured. I expected a grey-ish color, but this was black and white checkered, and not as nice. It almost looked like a picnic table cloth or something. Also, the material was kind of stiff. I still get compliments on it, but I wish it was what was pictured."
3.0,Hugs the curves and can see the rolls. Shrank up a bit too
3.0,"Nice, but it was missing one of the ear rings"
3.0,"Comfortable but fit is very wide in front area through mid-foot. Makes my foot slip out, and makes my feet look double their width.  Cute pattern!"
3.0,"It is not a man's vest despite the picture and caption.  The zipper pull is on the left side, men's, zipper pulls are on the right.  I ordered a large, it fits very snug...appears to be a woman's large.  It is nice ...that's why I gave it 3 stars....but it is a woman's vest."
3.0,"I have a 16 ½"" neck and though it fits around my neck just fine and serves its purpose as a neck gaiter, there is no extra material for anything else. Do not expect to use this for anything else but your neck."
3.0,Very scratchy. Falls apart
3.0,"The sizing and fit of the dress is accurate. I am about 5 ft tall at 170 pounds. I ordered an extra large and the dress fits well. However, the material is very thin and clingy. The clingy fabric shows all imprints of undergarments.☹️"
3.0,smaller than I imagined
3.0,My wife needs the correct size.
3.0,Extremely comfortable and baggy. Love the large hoodie. Fits loosely but shapes to my body. Fun home outfit. Material is soft and very stretchy. I ordered a large blue and it fits just like I wanted it to. I probly could have bought a medium but I have a long torso so the large worked out
3.0,They are good for the price. The lens smear a lot even when you clean it but they are super cut. I wish the plastic was less flimsy.
3.0,Cute dress size up
3.0,It way too big for kids
3.0,"the costume was nice and can be reused for years. I did have a problem breathing in the mask, it can get to the point of only wearing for a few mins."
3.0,These are very thin and very long in the stride! Had to return item because it did not fit and too thin!
3.0,"The dress is super cute, but the white is super see-through!"
3.0,"I loved how simple and pretty this necklace was but the chain and metal pendant housing gave me a red itchy rash. I wound up passing it to a friend whose skin wasn't as sensitive... 😞<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I gave this product another star. Less than 24 hrs after my initial rating, the company reached out apologizing that they didn't know it wasn't optimal for sensitive skin and issued me a refund. Keep in mind, I didn't request an apology or a refund. They have amazing customer service and that deserves to be recognized!"
3.0,"Es muy cómodo, pero no tan caliente como esperaba"
3.0,Shorts were as described a little tight on my daughter  Who wears a size 14 in regular pants got a size 14 in these shorts they did not fit. Belt and little purse are made out of cheap material
3.0,Ran very small through the chest.
3.0,"For a Black Milk Clothing knock-off I was actually really impressed by the quality of the materials. I was expecting thin and cheap but it's actually pretty thick, like real black milk. The fit was off and not in a this-just-wasn't-made-for-my-body-type kind of way. The bodice of the dress was almost drop waist length. I actually folded it up and wore a wide belt over it to conceal the fold to make it flattering. It also had a weird neckline, I couldn't exactly put my finger on what was wrong with it. It was almost like a children's dress a very conservative scoop neck kind of deal that would have been best on someone with no breasts. Having worn a the real style of BMC dress this is imitating it was obvious they may have the fabric down right but certainly not the pattern.<br />It still definitely exceeded my expectations though they were not high. I bought it for a Strawberry Festival and got many many compliments. I probably won't wear it again until I've had my seamstress friend take a hack at it. I'm still trying to decide if I just want her to shorten they bodice or just make a crop and skirt pair out of it."
3.0,Frame is kinda small.
3.0,They are hip huggers....for me they do not come up high enough over my belly.....but I am tall 6'2&#34;....slim....
3.0,"The shoes are cute. True red. They run small, but sizing up may be too wide. My daughter's toes were close to the end and she said it made her toes sore at the end of the day and that weren't too comfy.  No blisters though!  Also, the ends of the bows frayed very quickly.  For the price they were fine."
3.0,Mask came dented and disfigured so it doesn’t look right when being worn. Also had to re-cut the eye holes because the placement isn’t accurate
3.0,Good quality but tooo big!!
3.0,The band looks great with the silver case. I have the 44mm series4 and the band seems too wide preventing a smooth transition between band and watch. I was unable to get a proper fit. either too tight or loose. I’ll try it a day or two and then decide to keep it or return it.
3.0,Not what I was expecting; but still cute.
3.0,"Front zipper was to small for outdoor use. Needs to bigger teeth zipper for the front.  Bottom zipper catch does not hold.  Overall for that price. Quality control is bad, NOT RECOMMEND for heavy outdoor use.  You have order one or two sizes, bigger. Not cut to American Sizes."
3.0,"There okay, too dark to use at night for bed time reading.  which was the intent. have not tried then on overcast days to see if their good for driving."
3.0,"The sparkle factor of the feather of the belly ring dangle is absolutely gorgeous, however, the quality wasn't what I expected. The screw portion of the feather was not secure enough to hold the plastic BioFlex to the feather and would fall off continuously. Thankfully I was able to find the feather quickly and hope to be able to use some superglue to secure it in place so it doesn't keep falling off. It could have just been the one I was sent, but I love the comfort of the BioFlex and haven't had any allergic reactions to the material (the plastic or metal from the feather) like others I have bought from store chains such as Claires or Hot Topic. Along with this, the quality is wonderful and the feather dangle and metal accents have not tarnished or shown any sign of wear and tear."
3.0,"The bag itself is cute, seems sturdy except for the telescope handle is a little light and wobbly. The color is more green than it is teal/caribbean and the stitching was a little rough in some places. There was also a sticky looking film on the black trim when i opened the box. I hope this bag is of quality for the amount i paid for it."
3.0,Definitely waaaayyy smaller then it looked. Was suppose to hold 2 peoples stuff for a 5 day trip. Thats not happening. But it will hold bathing stuff.
3.0,"The zippers are cheap and don’t appear that they’ll last long however beyond that I am 5’11 and the smallest offering of 30/30 is slightly long for me. While I don’t want to criticize the product itself I’m leaving a bad review here to encourage selling clothing that fits humans. Please stop making your smallest size fit the average height, it means half of the market can't buy your clothes."
3.0,"The circles were impossible to close. I tried for 20 minutes before I gave up. The ring with the stones, and the U are the only ones that really work. The bigger corpse would’ve worked if the clasp worked. The others were way too small. So really, paid for 2 rings vs 6"
3.0,I was very disappointed in the fact that the watch was made of plastic and not metal like I thought it was other than that I am happy I ordered it
3.0,Don't like that it don't fit me and it don't come any bigger. I'm bummed about that.
3.0,They run kind of short and the quality of fabric is mediocre. They feel like they will pull easily.
3.0,I like how light the rings are but they’re too noticeable on my face. I should have gotten a smaller ring. They’re very easy to put in and take out!
3.0,"Just not pleased with the color. I was expecting azure which is blue like the clips. This band does not look light blue to me. It is, however, comfortable and fits my watch."
3.0,This is a very cute shirt but runs very small.
3.0,"Extremely difficult to fit into my tragus and took forever to get the back on. You have to try to fit your fingers into your ear... I have very small fingers and I even struggled, dropped it on the ground and even into my ear multiple times before getting it on. It comes as described and is a very pretty earring but DANG I wish the front was the part that screwed on instead of the back."
3.0,I was unable to wear them because of a bad shoulder.
3.0,"I got this for carrying to classes where I might need to haul some supplies that wouldn't fit in my tool box, as well as for things like the farmers market and traveling. It is not as good quality overall as the last one I purchased, the Cameron Crossbody. The material is thinner and the leather straps are not fabric backed and feel brittle and like they won't hold up long. The cross on the front is the same color as the straps, not reddish like I thought, which is no big deal but ads to a cheaper look. There are little pickets inside but they are too narrow and deep to be much use for holding say a smartphone or a pack of cigarettes or a lip balm...too annoying to fish small things out, too skinny to fit larger things. They'd probably hold your sunglasses and maybe headphones. There is also a zipper pocket, and the top zips which is useful. It's a cute bag, definitely unique looking, and I will keep it and use it for what I bought it for as long as it lasts. But for over fifty dollars, if I'd seen it in person in a store and felt the material no way would I have spent that for it."
3.0,"Fits a bit large, so order a size down. This is a spring top since the material is very thin. It wrinkles very easily and is a bit of chore to keep iron due to all of lace. There were many, many strings to cut at first, as well."
3.0,"Only 6 months in and the length adjuster is already cracked.  Otherwise, I would have given this product a higher rating."
3.0,It's really really cute but the leaves kind of poke into the sides of my belly button. And it's so curved that the daisy sort of droops forward and it's hard to see. Really cute concept just not executed as well as it could have been.
3.0,It is a little tight..  no special pocket for pictures and driver license...
3.0,"the stock inserts were terrible. Good thing I was throwing them away. I used my custom inserts and even glued some velcro to on them to keep them in place. Used the sandals on a week's vacation at the beach, they started to come apart at the toe. I used some shoe glue and C clamps to glue the cardboard like sub sole back together. I own Drew shoes and I love them, but for the price, they seem to have cut come quality corners on this product. Come to think about it, if I could give 2 and a half stars I would.  If I was not a handy guy I would have sent them back after 10 days of use."
3.0,"This wasn't as stretchy as I thought they'd be so if you order, I'd go up a size. It's really pretty though and if it was the right size, it would be perfect!"
3.0,"they are just ok, the foot is so long that the grips go up near my ankle and they are loose.  To be used at yoga, they need to fit securely and the grips need to hit the mat.  So I am still in the market for some yoga socks."
3.0,"I like the style of the bag, but it feels cheap. The outside material looks as though it might peel easy and the inside feels like it's lined with cardboard. Still going to keep it and see if it holds up."
3.0,Tapered cut...ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it was still to small.
3.0,This suit is great but it is NOT true to size. It runs small. I got the black one for my 7 year old who is 4’3 and wears an 8 normally. But the jacket is very tight. It will do for our event but I will be giving it away once it’s over. Go a size UP! You’ll thank me later.
3.0,"It is a good strap and comfortable, but a tad misleading as I thought it was Austria-made and instead it is in fact Chinese."
3.0,"While the quality of the watch and materials is average, there's not a thing wrong with it for a $14 watch. The leather strap seems to be plastic, but it's leather. (Think of it as patent leather.) The silver dial has  light green lime indexes, and at a glance it's difficult to tell the time and with the microscopic date window ... reading the date's not much easier. The brushed steel bezel is attractive, and it resembles the style and looks of a Patek Philippe Aquanaut, but don't expect anyone to mistake this Curdden with a Patek. It has a good heft to it, and it's a bit thick, but not greatly so. In the picture attached you can see the nylon crown guard that will prevent it from wearing out the battery before you buy it. It's a great watch for the money, but the materials are of medium quality which is befitting of a watch of this price."
3.0,"I got mine on a lightening deal. So worth that price, but it is a bit scratchy. I wonder if I wash it if that would help!"
3.0,It is much too big.  It looks dainty online. It's not.
3.0,Stretch was good but the model doesn’t look complete it doesn’t allow ur toddler to sit or play on the ground
3.0,I loved them until I washed them one time<br />And the mesh is tearing.
3.0,"A bit narrow for me, even though I ordered up as suggested. Nice fabric and well constructed."
3.0,"I didn't care for the sleeveless look.I normally take a medium, this was small.  As I said they run larger"
3.0,"Beautiful dress true to the color as pictured (green).  The only problem is the size its not loose fit as it states. I ordered a large it fits perfectly on the upper part, but if you are like me tall with a wider hip and a Brazilian bumbum, this dress is not for you it's too narrow on the lower part.<br />Costumer services was amazing though!!!"
3.0,I did like the dress  It just seemed like it was cheaper material. Didn’t hold up well
3.0,"The shape of the sweater was not flattering. I am hourglass shaped, 34 C bra, flat toned waist and slightly muscular arms. My shoulders are normal not too broad. If you look at the model picture you will see that the arms are short and droopy, meaning the sleeves starts well beneath the shoulder line. I typically do not like when the sleeve line starts mid upper arms because it makes the shoulders and upper arms appear wide. I purchased a small as usual and it fit fine but I did not like the shape, it made my upper arms looks fat. It also flattened my breasts. My recommendation for a sweater with this weird shape is to make it be oversized so go up a size or two. So I will be returning it. The actual sweater was fine not itchy, not see through, medium thickness and a combo of white and black threads.  Was super cheap and  ran true to size but decide for yourself if the shape is for you. my guess is this would probably be best for a busty woman with narrow shoulders.Bottom line its a decent sweater that's super cheap (&#62;$5)  just not for me"
3.0,My fingers are bigger than the models and im a 27 year old plus size gal . That means i have to wear them differently. So thats my advice. They are cute and im glad i bought them.
3.0,"GAP used to make the perfect sweatshirt in the 90's of this style - the inside wasn't 'fluffy soft' like this, but thinner - not exactly fleece.<br /><br />This is traditional fleece, which just doesn't hang as well or look as good, a bit staticy when removed, but its the closest I can find to the magically GAP sweatshirts of the 90's."
3.0,"I am not thrilled with this blouse, but it is cotton, and that is my priority.  It looks better as an overblouse rather then a shirt, which is a bit plain for me."
3.0,"pills, makes my legs itch. Is what it is."
3.0,"Nice.<br />Until the plastic arm sleeves started coming off. ):<br />Also, coloring is very different from pictures.<br />Not exactly what I ordered!!"
3.0,The top doesn't fall off my shoulder
3.0,En la parte de los bolsillos quedó muy grande
3.0,Cute but transparent.
3.0,Delivery was quick considering it was coming from the UK to the States. Shirt fits and feel good.<br /><br />Disappointed in the team logo on the left chest. It is nothing more than a sticker which will probably fall off after a few washings. I guess I was hoping it was a patch.
3.0,Kinda heavy and length is short
3.0,Fits smaller than expected. Would recommend sizing up
3.0,The color is very different than I expected.
3.0,"I'm 5'9 and 135-140lbs, I order two pairs in size small (gray and black with grays sides) and both are too short for my liking. The gray pair is a little short but the black with gray down the side are inches too short."
3.0,"Attention bucket-head people, Sarah Jessica Parker, and other people who just have big or long-a** heads!  These glasses are H U G E.  I think I have a large head (like I can't buy regular hats/helmets kinda big) and these glasses looked like a caricature on me.  If you're a cute girl and can get away with hater-blocker glasses, these might work for you.  But the Spicoli ""brahh"" guys are going to look like total D's wearing glasses this big.  LOL  Returned and got the standard size and FREAKIN' love em.  Great glasses, great price, just too daaaaamn big!"
3.0,"I like this shirt, but wish it had been more oversized."
3.0,"It does not dry well, I was looking for something small and with alot of power. This is not what I needed."
3.0,"The slip on this dress is sooo short. I ended up cutting out the original slip and using a longer one. Also, the material of the skirt is see through (hence the slip). I got white so can’t speak for other colors. The cut is great though, which is why I’m willing to make all these changes!"
3.0,"Super cute. Feel kind of cheap, but for 13 bucks it's okay"
3.0,It appears a little flimsy in the tail area and appears more like a bathing suit but for $25 it’s what you would expect!
3.0,"I loved these when I unpacked them. I put them on, and I want to break up with them. They run small and stretch to the point of being distorted. Shame."
3.0,Top part was smaller then sizing.  From waist  down fit beautiful
3.0,I read the reviews before I bought this product. They all said the same bad things about the over the door hooks so when I purchased this I had no intention of even using them. We screwed it directly into the door. Works great!
3.0,I love the style but I hate that I have to constantly fix them.
3.0,"This sweater is a nice weight. It is made of comfortable material and has a light stretch so it doesn't loose its fit. However, these sleeves are just WEIRD. They're completely snug from the shoulder to the elbow and the lantern is across the forearm.<br /><br />It just does not work for me. It turns the whole arm into a bizarre Popeye-shape. I feel like I should be cracking a can of spinach and smoking a pipe. I love the color and torso fit, but I can't get past these unflattering sleeves."
3.0,"Looks nice on, great shape to sleeves, but they are shorter than full length sleeves, great high turtleneck, good little bit of slouchy look and I wear a size 6 top, not a soft sweater, but not scratchy, no front or back marked, and no washing instructions tag. Much chunkier on model in photo, which I would have preferred. Will not purchase in another color."
3.0,"The lenses are great but the glasses way to big for a women's face, wish they came in smaller size."
3.0,The material is flimsy and doesn’t hold it’s shape. I ordered another pumpkin hat from Amazon because I was embarrassed to give yours to my grandson.
3.0,"I really like these clip ons. Fit well on my glasses and did the job. However, one of the screws fell out after not much use.  I haven't been able to find a replacement, yet. Still looking! Frustrating."
3.0,This wasn't bad.  The only thing I wasn't happy with is the way the beads all shifted to the back of my wrist.
3.0,Cute top but very clingy for a babydoll top.
3.0,"Super cute and fit to size, but the bottoms come off very quickly and very easily."
3.0,It’s good Material fit not too tight from waist down feels great as a casual dress or add a jacket to dress it up length is great right above knee I’m 5’3 146 38 bust large was to tight so I’m ordering an XL giving the large to my daughter
3.0,"The look of the glasses is nice, but they are made for a small head, 5.25 inches from temple to temple.<br />My head measures just over 5.5 inches from temple to temple.  So, I can only wear these glasses for short while before they start to hurt my temples.<br />Except for this, they would be nice glasses."
3.0,"After 6 months of very light use, the chain broke. The pendant is perfect, exactly what I wanted, so I guess I can just get a new chain, but I'm really disappointed in the poor quality of the chain."
3.0,"Only briefcase that I could find with two side pockets for drinks (good).  Nice and long for 14&#34; clip board (good).  However, the clips kept coming offshoot attached the front flap to the front (very bad).  They are magnetic.  I just kept them off, so as not to lose them forever.  Hence, I cannot really close the case normally (bad)."
3.0,"It's a decent knit dress, nice color, flattering, but it's certainly not a sweater knit, and I wouldn't wear it in cold weather, which is what I'm looking for in a sweaterdress. Very disappointed."
3.0,"As they run somewhat small, they were too tight.  But they are pretty, well-made, and do the job."
3.0,"These are great looking but when I opened them, it looked like there was some paint or finishing missing in certain spots that didn’t appear to be as shiny as the rest of the glasses. I still wear them as I don’t think it’s noticible but it’s still a bit disappointing"
3.0,"It’s a decent robe, though I’m disappointed it’s too big (s/m).<br /><br />But that’s the risk ordering online."
3.0,My 12 year old son asked for a watch for Christmas and we hit him this one. He likes it except the rubber band irritates his skin so we will try and find a leather one. Keep the instructions as it is hard to set.<br />Nice value!
3.0,"The material is thin, light, and airy; if a tiny bit scratchy.  The zero crotch room is great for letting everyone on the trail know, in surprising detail, what I'm working with. (Full disclosure: I haven't actually worn these in public.) It is possible I got mine a size too small, though they seem to fit okay in every other way."
3.0,I am normally a size 12-14 or large I clothing. I purchased a large and it was waaaaayyyy too small and has no stretch at all. I will be returning it. The dress is cute even though the fabric is thin I could've made it work if it fitted.
3.0,This product is good but I didn't like the quality.
3.0,"I love everything about it except its made for people with little foreheads and or bangs, i don't even have that big of a forehead but it pulls my hairline back more and gives me a noggin LOL. ill wear it in a few months once my hair grows out. If the front was about a half inch longer itd be perfect and give the look i wanted"
3.0,This not meant for men but you do not find out until you try it on! Since my review they have now listed this hat for WOMEN!
3.0,Not sure what this is supposed to do. It doesn't hold or compress & it's super sheer. I guess it's comfortable but really impractical as a clothing item.
3.0,too little. it is not I was looking for. I do not understand why does not show  the real size!
3.0,"The leotard is a nice color, comfortable and fits as expected. However, there was a big hole in the side stitching which was disappointing. From the inside it looks like it was a sewing defect. We didn’t have time to exchange it, so I ended up sewing it."
3.0,Loved the hat in the picture! The actual hat brim was way to big! The hat was really stiff
3.0,Watch band nice but my package was open and than taped shut don’t ever no if item is in the package  getting tired of this it’s happened before
3.0,"I was in the market for some new slides, and I have wanted to get a white pair for quite a while.<br />When I came across these, I loved the way they look so I went ahead and placed an order for them.<br />They arrived today, and at first glance, I thought they were awesome.<br />They looked really rich, Comfortable, and super stylish.<br />However, when I put them on, that was a different story.<br />First off, they run big. Like, a size big.<br />I typically wear a 13 to 14 depending on the shoe, I ordered these in 13 and they were still too big.<br />Also, the top part that goes over your foot which is made out of rubber is really big.<br />Even with a pair of socks on it was still way too loose and my foot slid around a ton.<br /> I’m really bummed because I had high hopes for these but unfortunately the fit is just a little bit too awkward on these. Unfortunately there is no way to adjust these to fit better.<br />So, I highly recommend getting a size smaller for you and then maybe you’ll have more success than I did.<br />I hope my review helps you to make a more well informed decision."
3.0,Used the small one for a 9 year old and it was still way to big. Quality seemed fine but we were unable to use.
3.0,"Cute dress, nice details... but too boxy if you have a larger chest."
3.0,Love how they fit and look just got them and first day wearing I noticed the pocket seam is all coming apart. 5”8 158 pounds bought a medium
3.0,I hope that I will get the good quality product with that high price. But not. I am wrong.
3.0,"this was purchased as a Christmas gift, hasn' been opened yet."
3.0,"The caps do not lie flat on top on an average sized man's head.  If you don't mind the extra cap on top, then it will be OK for you.  There are a lot of loose threads so not sure how well they wash, I am returning them.  These will fit a large to extra-large head.  Color and print look like the pictures.  They should make these caps in 2 sizes,"
3.0,"Its a very cool product for sure, just wish I would have ordered up a few sizes.<br />Way too tight"
3.0,"But the regular vision appears distorted. After wearing a while my eyes hurt.  I have tried 1 pair. I will try the other and if they are the same I will be returning hem,"
3.0,Nice and big but still classy. Unfortunately the hinge broke.
3.0,La calidad de la chaqueta es totalmente diferente como se ve y la describen en la imagen
3.0,"The necklace is really nice, but I can't open it.. You have to actually bite it to put it on, not sure how I'll take it off when the time comes :)  It is extremely hard to open.... But I'll keep it ;)"
3.0,Although I like the tan wedges I ordered the leopard colored wedges and was disappointed I received the wrong shoes
3.0,It's not soft which was disappointing but like the style.
3.0,Design is most accurate but doesn’t have a lot of stretch
3.0,Great shoe. A little small for a big wide foot but he can wear it in I'm sure.
3.0,Runs small stiff fabric I ordered large and they are snug
3.0,"This is one of the more uncomfortable bras I have ever owned. But beyond that, the bra cups curve out and a ridge line shows through everything I wear."
3.0,The top was cute but the shorts were an ugly lime green that didn't match the top. I returned this item.
3.0,"I just received the watch band and it’s a decent band for the price.  The packaging was nicely done and tools to adjust the band were included.  However, the directions were not.  The links are painted and was chipped a little when I opened the box.  The rose gold is not a true rosy color as described.  The finish is too shiny and shows fingerprints and smudges.  From a distance it’s a decent band but definitely not for everyday wear."
3.0,"Tight fitting around the belly, and what's with the single crystal??? It's too bad, because it's a really comfy shirt, if a bit thin."
3.0,"Super cute, but it is too short on me (size small and i'm 5'7''), plus, I expected a cotton liner and it's polyester."
3.0,it reture
3.0,I'm 5'10 145 lbs and this fit great! Only bad thing that happened was after entering the water the letters all fell off :(
3.0,One mask broke at the seam upon opening-<br />But the masks are very comfortable to wear
3.0,"i am petite 115# 34-28-38, b cup, i usually wear a small or medium for a blouse depending on arm cut, & large in women's t-shirts because i don't like shirts tight near the armpit area. the small was only tight in my hip area. bright white like pictured, not yellow like listed. not a flowy material, slightly stiff, may soften with washing. the top lace does not lay flat (it curls,) and it is a bit sheer, but otherwise a nice light cotton shirt. might make a cute cover-up in larger size. i gave to a friend. if lace laid down properly & was flowy-er i'd probably re-order a medium."
3.0,"This dress left me feeling very indifferent.<br />I did not find anything special about it.<br />I can not say it is ugly, it is just that I did not like it.<br />It looks like  replica of a doll dress, too childish, maybe ok for a child, but not for a woman.<br />I was way to fluffy in the hip/waist area that it made the bottom look heavy and bulky.<br />The fluffiness is not the &#34;flowy&#34; kind (tuille is probably too thick for that),<br />but has a very stiff pastic-y looking &#34;fixed&#34; look, it does not move when you move.<br /><br />It might be a good fit for someone very skinny with narrow hips and/or rectangular shape since it will create the curves for them.<br />For someone with a little extra pounds it will be too boxy and unflattering.<br /><br />I feel like the quality is good for the price.<br />And if you will be willing to invest some time to rearrange the waist area, this dress could be very beautiful.<br /><br />I am 5'5'' 144 lb, 36DD/E. My measurements are 39.8 (101cm)/ 34 (87cm)/ 39.8 (101cm).<br />I recommend to base your sizing for this dress on the chest circumference since it will be (too) roomy on the bottom anyways.<br />I ordered size M and I feel that it is slightly on a smaller side of M or a larger side of S in the chest."
3.0,Hello the only problem I have is I order a white dress it is not white it is off white. I have a all white dress & I put it beside it to make sure I was not color blind & yea this dress is off white which sucks cause I wanted white.
3.0,"I liked the light purple color and it was sized fairly well, perhaps a bit large. However, the material is not flattering for those of us with lumps and bumps. It is certainly nice and light for summer, but I just don't think I will feel comfortable wearing it in public. I wish I could buy the same thing in a thicker fabric. Length on me (5'2"") is just below the knee in the back, at the knee in front (split hem)."
3.0,"This dress is really cutr, but it’s not the best quality! It’s loose and thin fabric and the clasps don’t stay closed very easily. But for fashion it’s great!"
3.0,"ordered this a LONG time ago, I only got two of the three and never said anything but.......... I do still have and use one. Well made nice and soft bandana."
3.0,These were very nice. I wish I would have checked out the length of the chains. Thought they were going to be longer.
3.0,Airlines tore it
3.0,Arrived later then expected which has nothing to do with the product itself. Kind of long and a little challenging to put on yourself. I have a 7” wrist and the shortest length is what I need to wear this band. You have to press two metal posts thru the band to get it to lock and hold. It slips under like the silicone Apple Watch brand bands do. It’s decent for the price.
3.0,"Nice color.  Silk not the best quality, stiff and rougher to touch than better quality silks. It smelled foul coming out of the plastic packaging.  I had to allow it to air out overnight before wearing it.  The smell eventually dissipated by next morning.  It served its purpose as a beach wrap/ coverup."
3.0,"I have a larger than normal head and could barely get it on.  When i did, it looked very deformed because it did not line up with my features correctly.  Eyes in particular.  If you have a normal to small size head it would probably be great, but if you have a big head, then I would pass.  I returned it.<br /><br />Other than the fit, the product was as advertised."
3.0,"My son is super duper picky about goggles. We have tried probably 4 different pairs of goggles. These were not the finalists. He found the comfortable, but once he got in the water, he said they kept coming off. We love Aegend and ended up going with the regular adult sized goggles. So, it's possible these were just too small for him. And, like I said, he is super picky. He swims about 3 times a week and knows what he likes."
3.0,These r ok . Some of the socks were not sewn all the way . One set had a hole in them . I should have sent them back but my granddaughter had already opened them and put them on .
3.0,"This bag is very cute and seems very durable, but the strap is the shortest strap I've ever seen on a bag.<br /><br />It basically strangles me when I try to wear it and it makes me sad as I really want to use this bag."
3.0,These are nice earrings but I requested red and got a bright orange.
3.0,These go clear to my arm pits I already have sleeves
3.0,I already sent one set back because it was too tight on top and in the pants; the second set was a better fit there but far too long in the sleeves.  I guess it's my shape rather than the garment.
3.0,"It looks nice but its a little too tight, smashes the nose and my nose is small. Ha.<br />Its also just bunches up that you cant really even see all the beautiful print. Aww...too bad. I'll<br />still keep it and use it for something else, maybe modify it."
3.0,"I have this outfit 3 stars because it's huge. I ordered it for my niece. She is almost 2, so I got a 2t. It fits my 6 year old daughter perfectly.  I do love the look though. We made it work so I could take her pictures for her birthday invitations."
3.0,Not as much support as I had hoped for - other brands are better for my size.
3.0,Skirt is great fabric and cute pockets but so short. If you are over 4’11 then it won’t be ankle length. I’m 5’1 and it hits an inch above my ankle so I don’t wear it.
3.0,You have to order two sizes up for the dress to fit
3.0,Face scratches very easily. Not durable but works for it's purpose.
3.0,"Golden hoop had problems (One is bent, the other hardly clamps.) Other than that no problems."
3.0,"This watch looks great and came in perfect shape and condition! I already wear it inside a big waves ocean and it went trough it perfectly, also the 1,3,5,10,15,30 alarm setting on the 3rd circle is making all my duties easiest in a way I couldn't imagine before.<br /><br />The only thing I don't really like is the the light which stay for a couple of seconds and doesn't have a uniform expansion on the screen, though I am really satisfied with this purchase!<br /><br />Update: I cut down stars from 4 to 3 due to the ""sensitiveness"" of the screen, which actually got scratched VERY easily. I have already two big ones and that's it. I wished it was just stronger!"
3.0,"IDK .. Maybe I'm a little bigger then I thought .. But it was very cute the sleeves are detachable, you have too place the strings in once you get it. the shirt is very stretchy, the material is cheap wore it for a 2000's party so it gave me a great look.."
3.0,"The pieces for the back are either to hard to get out and u end up damaging the products trying to get it off or it’s so lose it doesn’t even stay on the keychain, honestly I bought these as a tester hoping they would be awesome but they was in fact what I thought cheaply made. But what I ended up doing with them they worked great for so I ended up using the ones I could get apart or that slipped out to easy. What I did was take a picture laminated it and the cut to fit put the picture in there and then dipped the keychain in resin and made them like that!!!"
3.0,"Ended up returning because it arrived with black mark on the fabric that wouldn't come off. Soft fabric, appeared to run a little loose."
3.0,"Runs narrow. I am medium to large, 5'4&#34; at 145# bought an XL. It is tight in my arms, neck and shoulders. Plus, the material is scratchy, the type that catches on your skin of fingertips. I use it for winter sleeping to keep my neck warm. I have yet to find a turtleneck short night gown that is perfect. This one has the right length (mid-thigh) and it is stretchy so it doesn't bind while turning over in bed. The material is just icky and it is too narrow for comfort."
3.0,"No gift box, came attached to cardboard in plastic bag, not gift worthy presentation. Earrings are cute for the price."
3.0,Very pretty right. Turns finger green fast thigh
3.0,"looks great, but runs small"
3.0,If it was double printed I would give it 5 stars but I guess this will do
3.0,"I loved these sunglasses. They probably have the only frames that I like. The cat eye design isn't overbearing and it had a good fit. The plastic was... well, plastic. I would've kept them if it wasn't for the intense chemical smell that made it unbearable for me to wear."
3.0,The charm was very nice but the shane was discolored and seemed old.
3.0,"I wanted to give this a higher rating, but it fell apart within the first 3 hours of wearing at work (deskjob). Beautiful piece, just cheaply made. &#34;Get what you pay for&#34; applies here."
3.0,"All the reviews said it would run small, so I got a bigger size, but that is a little tight too.  You need to go at least 3 sizes bigger than you normally would."
3.0,These are a bit big in the waist . And they’re not high waisted on me. They’re actually the opposite. They don’t come up high enough on me. Every time I bend over they’re falling down and showing my butt. So I ended up donating them.
3.0,This item is perfect!!!! It made mask making easier! I gave this product 3 stars because it was from China. The long wait was upsetting. I didn’t make my deadline. Lost money. I would like if Amazon would require companies to tell what country an item is coming from.
3.0,A little more oversized than I expected.
3.0,"Cheap texture, although my son love’s it"
3.0,Just received didn’t understand why the tag is in the wrong place!! But oh well
3.0,"Liked the color, however, it turns out dirty"
3.0,Not as pink. It's moral of a nude pink and no where near that color shown in the photo. It lasted a good 6 months before breaking.
3.0,I found the purse difficult to open. The purse was for a wedding.
3.0,"It's very nice, but it should be about two to three inches longer for more options. It fits pretty snug and I am a 27 inch waist."
3.0,"Dearfoams had become my go-to slippers.  This style is attractive, comfortable and has a hard sole so I can run out to my mailbox without putting on shoes.  I have worn a medium in this style slipper for years.  Last summer, I bought a pair of this style in a medium and they are so big I need to wear sox to keep them on my feet.  So, when I ordered these, I bought a small.  Well, they are way too small.  My heels are slightly off the back of the slippers and they are tight.  I am keeping them since it is summer ( in Phoenix) and I go barefoot except to get my mail but seems like I am going to have to try on slippers now to get the correct fit.  Why do companies not adhere to uniform sizes????"
3.0,"These are extremely soft and comfortable; however, I needed them for a specific Halloween costume and the color pink in the picture is NOT the color that I received. It is a much darker pink."
3.0,Buenas para el precio algunas rotas y otras que no más tocan el agua de playa y se deshace de color
3.0,Yes the style is super cute. The legs run true to size but the waist is huge. I am a petite 10 or regular size 8. Hour glass shape so the legs were snug but the waist was about 6-8 inches too big. These would be great for someone who has a thicker waist or belly because the waistband is elastic and stretches a lot.
3.0,"A couple of the designs are great, and a couple look like they came out of a gumball machine.  Ultimately returned the set as it wasn't worth $18 in my opinion."
3.0,I like it but the necklace is longer then expected and hides in my low cut shirt
3.0,"This mask is a hard plastic mask. The mask does not have any give. Luckily it will still work for my formal date, but I do have a fear that it will be too big on his face - that being said I wouldn't order for a child, in fear that it would be too big."
3.0,"It is a wind breaker, that's it. Is not very warm and I wore it in the rain and was soaked. It looks nice and I wear it sometimes, just not a substantial jacket."
3.0,"These earrings are really tiny.  Like kid-size.  They don't sparkle as much as I would want.  And the post is fat, so that I have trouble getting them through my holes.  They are comfortable once i have them on.  They don't dangle.  They don't sing. Look kinda cheap."
3.0,It too small.
3.0,Doesn’t fit me
3.0,"They work well but on my 7 year old and myself (33f) they are snug. I bought them for my son to wear in the classroom to block out noise for testing, but I think they'd be uncomfortable for anyone over the age of 5 to be worn for more than 20-30 mins."
3.0,It was a gift for my sister and she loved it but it was supposed to come with the necklace and didn't have one so she's going to have to keep it in the bottle
3.0,"I bought this because I had to see how it compares to the much more expensive Shock Absorber that looks the same.  It looks almost the same put side by side, but the straps are not the same and the fabric isn't exactly the same.  It doesn't give the same support.  Either the sizes run big or the fabric stretched out too much because it is not the same fit at all.  Too bouncy for jumping and jogging for me.  Just had to make sure I was getting what I pay for!"
3.0,Magnet missing. Threw it away because I cant even wear it.
3.0,Sizing not correct but these are beautiful! Careful with the size!
3.0,These are goodie bags! Not ment for anything else.
3.0,"Pretty necklace, but arrived broken.  Thankfully it’s an easy fix, but still frustrating."
3.0,It's ok.  Does the job but kind of cheap.  Rubber bands on the side.  Definitely not worth $60.  Their profit margins must be enormous.
3.0,"The T shirt will probably not be worn very much, as the cotton is not soft to the skin. It will take many washings to be wearable."
3.0,They're cheap. You get what you pay for
3.0,"This is a decent skirt for the price. After a wash, the skirt seemed lose a little color. I'm 5'6"", 150lbs, with narrow hips. I ordered a large and that fits pretty well. Waist is slightly loose."
3.0,"i ordered based on the description given, however the item was a bit larger than described."
3.0,"While this piece is absolutely beautiful, the elastic band loses elasticity after a few uses and does not stay snug to your wrist"
3.0,feels plastic to me. Colors are a little off...
3.0,Its thinner than expected & much shorter on an avg size man than on the model. My husband is 6 foot and it hit him above the knee. Returned this product
3.0,"They are nice earrings but slightly disappointed. My disappointment is that the beads are a little bulky. And some of them protrude through to the other side of the earring. Otherwise, they are a cute statement pair of earrings."
3.0,I have ordered or traveling and I tried to put shoes and it's perfercthanks
3.0,"They look cute online (they always do) but the color is strange and so far I cannot find something to wear with them.<br />bummer purchase, too late to return."
3.0,Looks good but it was way too big.
3.0,Ok ... shorter Thani wanted
3.0,Polyester
3.0,The fabric is not ideal for hot weather
3.0,It good for the spring very light weight.
3.0,Very comfy band. Came with a single bent spring bar. Metal clasp came pretty scratched up. For the price its not too bad.
3.0,The color and style is perfect except that the butt is nearly transparent
3.0,Not as I expected. A bit too small and thin. I like the Dri Fit Microfiber Bodybuilding Stringer Tank Top. I will buy more of that one.
3.0,"Definitely runs narrow. Fine for shower flip flops at the gym, but if I were to wear them around a beach or a pool day they’d definitely get uncomfortable."
3.0,"Very flattering cut (upper seam neither too high nor too tight, meaning it looks good even on the non-flat-chested), nice length, and (the sine qua non, for me), it has POCKETS!!  It could be a little more opaque, but it's mostly fine.<br />Revised review: I will probably have to return this dress due to the very odd (and practically useless, not to mention VERY annoying) pocket placement.  We usually like to have pockets around where our hands fall.  This dress has them up beside the breasts!  No, thank you.  I'm not sure if I just got an anomaly, where the seamstress cut the fabric from the wrong side and rather than starting over,  just turned it upside down or what, but this won't do.  Such a shame! I'd originally given this 5 stars, but useless pockets are a deal-breaker for me."
3.0,Chose size based on measurements in the product description but the actual dress was many inches too large in all dimensions. My friend is 2 dress sizes bigger than me and It ended up fitting her perfectly. Disappointing because I really love the look and fabric.
3.0,"I love the color of this hoodie but it was not soft and comfy enough, on the inside, for my liking. I typically wear a medium but found it to be too tight (I’m an athletic build 5’7” and 160lbs)."
3.0,Nose pads are too hard on my nose
3.0,Key Ring and Pen were not included in the order.
3.0,Just ok. Nothing special. Needs to be polarized.
3.0,Very soft<br />Very comfortable<br />Definitely not sturdy enough for a pre-teen<br />Also fit very snug
3.0,SMALLER THAN SHOULD BE MARKED AS XL
3.0,"Pretty comfortable except the &#34;tag&#34; that is in the middle of the slipper. It raises up and is kind of uncomfortable when I walk in them for a bit. Also, the traction on the bottom will pick up tons of dirt and track it all over the house, so don't walk in moist dirt, mud or anything but sidewalks or asphalt. OR just take them off when you get to someone's or your home."
3.0,It's  ok
3.0,Me gusto pero la diadema se resbala
3.0,I really like this apron and the image on it I will definitely use it when I am baking or cooking something greasy I wasn't expecting it to be so stiff and I really don't like that. I'm hoping after a few washes it will relax the material. It has two pockets and I love that cause I can't go anywhere without my phone. It is waterproof. All in all I would say research material if that matters to you.
3.0,"This dress looks lovely on but at times throughout the day during my first wearing, the material at the neck line shifted and gapped showing the frontg of my bra. I'll need to wear a cami next time- boo! As a reference, I am 125 pounds, 5'4'' and 34d. I purchased this dress in a small."
3.0,"I like the bottom bra-part of this crop top, but the mesh part is extremely thin, the seams are too heavy, stitching is shoddy, and it's just plain unattractive and horribly done. If you sneeze the wrong way the thin mesh part will rip, and on mines, it had a little section where the mesh was torn a little above the left breast -- making it unwearable. I think this crop top is a good idea, just poorly implemented. I also couldn't get it pulled down the shoulder fully like it is worn in the model photos. I would pass."
3.0,"I got tha shoes for my lil girls who seem pleased with tha shoes,but me personally i question their authenticity. But in this company's defense i dont even wear vans so im not so sure"
3.0,"I wear a size 6 (small), but I ordered a medium & it fits comfortably....,the small would have been too tight. I never thought I had a large head....but the head piece does NOT fit at all. It’s not that it’s tight....I can’t even put it on! From the picture it seems that cigarette holder is included, but it was NOT sent. The fish net stockings fit (I just placed one leg in to try it).<br />I guess I will have to order a separate head piece and the cigarette holder. Unless the seller sends me one??? And maybe a larger head piece???<br />If not, I guess I’ll have to spend extra money to get these items.  For this reasons (head piece & cig holder)I deducted the 2 stars."
3.0,"Arrived with a permanent crease in the middle from being folded. Good is it's lightweight as stated, but is not an elasticized strap, so is hard to take on and off without messing up your hair."
3.0,"the pictures make it look so slim, but as soon as you put you id and 3 cards in, it balloons to the size of a normal wallet. since i already have normal wallets, this isn't for me. that being said, the wallet has a nice design and seems well built, but why bother using a money clip if the wallet is already big enough to hold cash?"
3.0,I think this is nice necklace.  It's just too heavy for intended pendant I have.
3.0,Very cute but run a little narrow.
3.0,The description said cotton. This dress is thinner than I would like and definitely doesn't feel like the same cotton dresses I had been ordering on Amazon before. I wish they would allow people to buy good quality sturdy cotton dresses and not these thin knock offs.
3.0,"Began showing wear and tear (card slots tearing, latch is cracking, and magnet doesn't work) before 30 days of normal use. Not happy with product."
3.0,Pretty setting but the ring was sent without two of the side stones.
3.0,They are bit smaller than others. At least get one size bigger than used too. Washed once and allready got holes. But they sure are soft
3.0,This item is of inferior quality. It turned my wrist green. I'm returning it for a full refund.
3.0,i bought the bow tie for my grandson and he was pleased
3.0,"you do not get 2 metal locking , one has been changed to magnetic , misleading ad"
3.0,"I bought medium instead of small. The romper tore, I gave three stars because of the tear."
3.0,These southern marsh shirts have such cute colors and designs but the shape is so weird. Too long and narrow with big boxy sleeves.
3.0,"Looked really nice for the low cost, but the stone fell off the first 24 hours!"
3.0,"Not the best, the shape of the leaf is a really deep V, making them stick out pretty far from my ears. They're smaller than I thought they would. Might still return."
3.0,great looking necklace the lobster claw clasps would not open  I had to repair it but that's okay because it looks so good on me
3.0,Masks are thin and fit loosely. I was searching for masks made in the US - received these and found they were made in China... packaging is also poorly translated - mentions washing but no washing instructions.
3.0,I ordered the blue and the red. Blue is see through. Red pops nicely. Way too short for me at 5'8&#34; and it's not made for my torso as my chest was lower than the A-line seam. Not made for chesty girls. Perfect in red for petite gals. Ties on shoulder come seperate. Deep V in back and flirty hemline is very feminine.
3.0,Pendant is pretty enough but the string is really thin from the neck rope through some stones and it frayed 2 days after wearing necklace so now it's just a wall hanging because I don't know how to fix it. Also the stones look like they were thrown in the mold rather than arranged per the picture. Design is flawed.
3.0,The weight of the camera may overencumber the headband if not strapped on tight enough to head. Also very tall People like myself find themselves having to look downward or squatting to get a better shot. People's heads are cut off from the shot when walking/filming. May work much better on shorter people I think because I'm 6'3 and can't film the people in the surroundings without watching downward.
3.0,"the material feels good and the fit is fine, but not interested in the ""boxing shorts"" style of waistband"
3.0,The fabric and fit were fine but the cut was off creating one large sleeve and one small.
3.0,It's really pretty but I've only warn it once and it's already starting to unravel
3.0,Very cute but not machine washable
3.0,"Pretty cheap, and pretty thin, but you get what you pay for. They’re soft but they don’t feel like they’ll last a long time. They’re also very festive."
3.0,After a few wears and washes these tend to get holes in them.
3.0,Nice bracelet but expected it to be a little heavier like my other Montana Silversmith pieces. Still nice for the price though.
3.0,"They are really heavy, but beautiful. Unfortunately they don’t wear well"
3.0,"These shorts are fine and serve their purpose as shorts to sleep in. I am sure they could also work as workout shorts if you are cool with the middle school gym shorts look (and that might be the style these days, I am too old to care)."
3.0,A bit short than expected
3.0,The background it's the same .
3.0,"Cute and fit as expected, but the colors are not what are pictured.  Mine was much more orange.  It's comfortable and soft fabric."
3.0,Took FOREVER to receive and is much bigger/thicker/duller than it looks in the picture. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,The wings broke quickly and had to be glued back together.
3.0,"it fit just fine but i thought the color was going to be darker, so i had to return it."
3.0,I ordered my shoe size but I need a size larger. Other than that I was happy with the look and product.
3.0,"Loved everything about this dress, but had to return it. It was WAY too long!! I'm 5'3"" and ordered the small. It was about two+inches too long. I was very sad about that and wished they had an XS."
3.0,These fit weird. Ok to run with. Wide frame
3.0,Too short.<br />Is particularly small in the sleeve length
3.0,My son likes it. I wish there was a way to tighten them though.
3.0,"Cute shirt, soft, longer larger than expected. I ordered a medium, as I always do. This time it felt like I ordered a large."
3.0,"It's a beautiful piece, but tends to be very heavy after a few hours of wear. There is NO CUFF on the upper part of the earring, so you kind of have to wrap it around your ear to keep it from toppling down, which makes it look rather awkward. It would have been better if there was a cuff on the upper part of the earring to keep it in place."
3.0,It was vibrant in color but was smaller than I was expecting.
3.0,"Don’t think you can wear just this skirt. When you put it on, the whole front is open. You’ll need an underskirt or entire other costume piece so plan on that. Also, I’m 5’4”. 115lbs. So it’s not like I’m too big for it to wrap around. Beautiful blue color though."
3.0,"Bought this hoodie for my 8 year old; looks good but the material you can tell is pretty cheap, especially for the price."
3.0,"For my 5’, 100 lb daughter the large was fine from a length (girth) standpoint but too large in the girth of the arms. She is not a scarecrow, so it seems the manufacturer does not know how to handle larger sizes.  She loved the look.  Returned."
3.0,it fits ok but i felt it is long
3.0,"Bought the Large size, S/h done M. I'm 36c... wanted them to be a little bit tighter. Compression? Not really compression material."
3.0,Didn’t fit quite as expected but still loved the fabric and was still happy with my purchase as it wasn’t too tight but a little bigger than I had liked. Still would buy this product!
3.0,Really nice but order too big.
3.0,"mmmm, i could easily finded t this one at my town for $5.00 dlls. if I bought here and paid $7.98 is because I was expecting a better quality.<br />that was my mistake I guess, I won't take the time for return it either since I did break the bank to buy it!"
3.0,Very flimsy and thin material.  Started to fall a part after the first wash.
3.0,Love the jeans but too big
3.0,"Just not for me nothing wrong with the product ,"
3.0,I got the large because I read the reviews that said this runs small.  I usually wear a small or medium.  This was still very narrow in the shoulders.  I gave it to my 13 y/o granddaughter.  She likes it very much.
3.0,"This necklace is gorgeous in pictures!<br /><br />I'm not sure if others can tell how cheap looking it is close up or not. I've gotten compliments on it and I just try to discourage my friends/family from touching it. The felt backing makes it very lightweight and cheap feeling. I keep thinking that it is going to fall off or blow away.<br /><br />Overall, I really do like the look, but I feel like I am wearing my little sister's cardboard art project while wearing it."
3.0,looks o.k and quality seemed to be fine as well.<br />It's not as impressive as in the photo though
3.0,Absolutely love this dress. I purchased it in the black sunflower 🌻. I received so many compliments and its very comfortable to wear. Only dislike—— So far I have only worn the dress once and the stretchy stitching on the bust part of the dress is already coming undone 😫.  I would have giving 5 stars but I don’t think this dress will survive past a few more wears. I almost want to purchase another because of how much I love this dress but it’s no longer available so I’m taking it as a sign. lol
3.0,"I bought multiples of these because when I first got them they were super comfortable. If you were only going to wear these to an indoor gym, I think they'd be great! However, I wear them outside on sandy ground and within minutes the socks catch little pits of sand and gravel inside the lip at the back of the ankle. That sand then works its way down the sock and just gets pressed against my ankle/foot until I'm back home and can take my shoes and socks off. First time it happened I thought it was a fluke, but it's been consistent across multiple wears. Recommend these for indoor use, but definitely look elsewhere if you'll be walking/hiking outdoors."
3.0,Doesn't stay in
3.0,I like the comfort but the fit is a little tight and short
3.0,M  muy grande
3.0,"Looks nice, but, wire connections are very fragile and become disconnected after a few uses.  Somewhat flimsy."
3.0,"I took a chance on the size because the size chart wasn't helpful. The bottoms fit, but the top is too small and flimsy (no support for a plus size bikini top)"
3.0,Flimsy but OKfor my aqua fitness class.
3.0,This are adorable but I purchased the 2 pack and the pink ones fit great but the blue are way bigger and fall off my face. I’m not sure why they are such different sizes.
3.0,"I like the color, but the material was a little thick and the waistband could have had more stretch, or more give."
3.0,"I'm going a little on the low end, only because I think it is a little too pricey for what the product is. I like the dress a lot, it fits where it should (not quite like the model), but the material and construction is more in the 15 and under price range if you ask me."
3.0,Cute set & nice price. My grandson will love thid
3.0,With a little defect... some white spots on it
3.0,It was ok bery flimsey
3.0,Cute and good quality but shorter than I was anticipating.
3.0,Its not beige like the picture. What I received is white trimmed with black. Disappointed as I didn't want white.. I wanted beige.
3.0,I am 5'2 and ordered a small. The straps on this dress were to long cutting to low and showing my bra. The material is very heavy and not forgiving at all. I am not very big but after having 3 kids I am not in the shape I would like to be in. This dress clings to your body showing everything.
3.0,Manufacturer says they will look at size. Size suited for Women's 5-7 only.
3.0,"Thin material, but my dad likes it.  It’s very lightweight and he wears it around the house.  It’s not great quality and not great to look at."
3.0,"If you dont want them to be basically form fitting, I'd size up."
3.0,I would have given this all the stars IF it had been the real size . It was at least 2 sizes to small and it wasn't as long as the pic .
3.0,Consider the tan this suit will leave behind.
3.0,Ordered L and XL as gifts. There was very minimal sizing difference. The XL is more like a L. And the L was like a MED-L. Ordering a 1X since it seems this maybe more of an XL for two gifting purposes.<br /><br />The fleece material is as expected. It's not very thick tho. Pattern is exactly as depicted.
3.0,"It worked for our 2 1/2 yo dance classes, but pilled quickly with just one wearing."
3.0,Size is not right it says that the size is true but it is not runs larger .ordered a large would have ordered a medium if i had known  and picture  is much nicer than the product and it is not a sweatshirt like you are expecting to see  more of a lite silky shirt with hood
3.0,OK not great but ok
3.0,Ghkbgc
3.0,The coloring is great and look is stylish but the band broke in a few weeks - it has a small link in it broken so it now snags on my clothes.  This is why the low score for durability.
3.0,"The band is very small, and doesn't look like it would last a long time. From afar it looks pretty stylish though."
3.0,My neck was hot so they will be good for the winter
3.0,"Upper part too smal, couldn’t put strips through the shoulders. Too narrow"
3.0,Give it 3 because I live the material and color. ..however this the size was a bit off. ..8 ordered a large fitted to close
3.0,It runs a little smalll
3.0,These earrings were much prettier in the picture. Not impressed at all in person.<br />Phyl p
3.0,This just fits a little weird. The bottoms fit like a diaper. The top is fine but there’s absolutely no support and just looked a little “off” to me.
3.0,I really like the skull cameo part of these earrings. I really really dislike the actual earring part. It is very poorly designed and I am immediately going to go to my local Hobby Lobby to buy some replacement hooks and just redoing them myself. Hence the three stars. The cameos are cute but the poor hooks make them totally unwearable as is. Changing them is a Very easy fix but I still have to fix them so...
3.0,"The charm was a little small, the quality was not great, but my daughter loves it and that's all that mattered in the end!"
3.0,"The cut is off. The fabric is like a man's disco shirt, shiny, slick,  and not a t-shirt texture at all. The Henley idea is lost in the wrong fabric, and cut of the shirt too.  I wear a small shirt or a medium shirt and rely on the size chart when ordering on line. I ordered a medium, and it doesn't fit, but I'm not sure that ordering a small would help that much. I am 5'8"" 130lbs, 34 D bra, and 35 or so chest. I wear a 28 jean. This makes me look frumpy.<br /><br />Some how the shoulders want to pop up and pull up then fall forward and fold. I don't like it, it reminds me of a mail  order garment from the old days. I once ordered a beautiful dress online for an event. When it arrived, it was horrible.  Just like this.  I think the ad is not selling the shirt so that my expectations were met.  The color is not attractive either.  If you look at the color swatches to the side, that they offer, those colors don't match and definitely more peach in tone for the color swatch. This fabric reminds me of the 80s and dusty rose. The lower hem and body fit is okay, but again this is not a pleasant fabric and style.  It's frumpy and isn't easy to wear. Doesn't look like the ad.<br /><br />If the shoulders are pulled down correctly, the arm pits are too low. The arm pits win and move up. This is a bad shirt.  Clothes should be effortless and should fit and stay in place. This is not that. Why bother if you are going to make something do it well, we're talking resources and industrial waste by creating these things. People deserve better after spending so much time shopping. Things must be accurate in the add and the clothes on the model need to be the exact same item.  Even the cap sleeves are off. Anyway....<br /><br />3 stars."
3.0,Not so much small as lonnng. I gave it away.
3.0,Nice-looking watch I have another of the same brand I bought this one because they elude to it being water resistant and I am testing it in the water to see if it is! I gave it three stars because I'm still testing it. What's confusing they say it's good until maybe a hundred or so meters but then they say don't shower with it lol.. well I showered with it and I also went into the jacuzzi with it... so far so good. Time will tell hopefully no pun intended... that's again why I gave it three stars since the jury is still out.
3.0,"One of my rings was bent and flat.  The others are lovely. I wished the whole lot of them were nice.  Otherwise, got the rings quickly and they are very nice for the cost!"
3.0,Stone it's small.
3.0,They were fun mouth seemed a little off on both of  ours but we stretched it out and it was fine. My daughter wanted matching one for us
3.0,Cute but broke fast and easy
3.0,My father was very glad with the bag.
3.0,Puede se más gruesa
3.0,"I ordered it large based on the reviews, but it was to large.  This dress would have been really nice, but the bow was sewed on the dress oddly."
3.0,"The arms were too short and the shirt had no type of stretch to it. I’m 5’4, 125lbs and I got this in a small. Thought it would replicate the image shown, a little off from the picture. 6/10, still overall a cute top."
3.0,"Nice thin band, however it did have some kinks/wrinkles in the mesh and was too PINK for the rose gold color.  Returning.  Delivery was prompt, seller good."
3.0,"Tried to use these for my cartilage piercing but it wouldn't go through the hole, but works for my regular holes"
3.0,"I got these yoga pants for myself as loungewear because I stay home more often during the pandemic. These pants are super soft, stretchy and light, giving my skin a silky touch. I love wearing them because they are comfortable. However, they are pretty long for me, and I’m 5’4”. Moreover, the waist band is too thin, so it doesnt stay on my waist well. In overall, these pants are okay to wear at home but not qualified to wear out as yoga pants."
3.0,Really nice gift for a longhorn fan that i know...
3.0,"They are a size 8, although I wanted them a little bigger than my shoe size im fine with it. It does not come with the fur hearts on it, I was really disappointed about that because that was the main reason I paid $15. Other than that they are cute, but I can find better ones for less than $10."
3.0,it is a very cute necklace to layer with
3.0,I got a medium because that's what I normally wear in dresses and it fits rather large on me. My husband calls it my &#34;Mumu.&#34; It is comfortable and it looks way too large for me to wear out in public sobibjust use it as a nightgown or around the house!
3.0,Pretty but small for wrist
3.0,"Nicely made shirt with pockets. However, it runs very small. Usually a medium is fairly roomy on me (5'5' 135 LBS) but this was too tight. Go at least one size up."
3.0,Comfortable even for non-jean wearers.
3.0,Cute. Ran big. Especially in the arm holes. the white seemed see through so back it went.
3.0,It's a little heavy (durable?) and a bit small for XL
3.0,it has change colors. (tarnished)
3.0,"Beautiful on the outside. Looks like genuine leather. Please read the description . It is not genuine leather and it was smaller than I thought. The inside is made of cheap material. For the price though, it will work"
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter's birthday. After a couple hours, the flowers and bow both fell off."
3.0,"Nice, but it is buttercream. Not white."
3.0,"I kept having to fix the ring into my nose all night. Each time I laughed, the ring would begin to slide off of my nose which sucks. Other than this, they are super cute. Think I’d rather get a real piercing again than a slip on"
3.0,"I like the size of the bag but the inside zipper came detached from the tracks. Other then that, I like it"
3.0,"The cuts in the fabric make the garment fit awkwardly, the shoulder cut puts are off centered and too long. It fits, but its not s polished as the picture the seller is using. Would not by from them again."
3.0,The shoulders were tight
3.0,"For clothing, the important points of evaluation are accuracy in sizing, quality of materials, the feel of the fabric on your skin, wash-ability, closet-space and fold-ability. As such, for dresses, these are the points I evaluate. I can't evaluate style, as we all have different tastes, but the objective points can be easily reported in review, to aid you in your search for that special something that will work for you and make you feel beautiful.<br /><br />Accuracy In Sizing:  This dress is not sized accurately. It is a bit larger than stated. Additionally, the bust is very difficult to situate. The shoulders move so freely that the bust routinely moves downward, exposing the bra. This isn't a very well fitted dress, but loose dresses are generally designed to hang in a specific way, in a specific position, to allow for the person to move around in the dress without fear of it falling down. This is designed very poorly and falls easily due to poor sizing in the upper portion of the dress.<br /><br />Quality Of Materials:  The material on this dress is of average quality and slightly thinner texture. It is thick enough to not be see through and to appear of decent quality, however, it is not a very thick material and feels thin.<br /><br />Feel Of Fabric:  The fabric is soft and comfortable, not ultra-soft, but, still, quite comfortable and easy to wear.<br /><br />Wash-ability:  The fabric is washable and can be washed easily. It should be washed inside-out, as should all garments.<br /><br />Closet-Space:  This one takes up an average amount of hanging-space, but can compress easily. It did wrinkle a bit, when compressed, but wrinkles came out easily.<br /><br />Folding:  This dress can be folded like a t-shirt and creases come out easily.<br /><br />Good luck finding the dress that will make you look and feel amazing."
3.0,It’s okay. Like a comfortable house dress.
3.0,Kind of cheap and they turn colors
3.0,"This some what fit me.<br /><br />Normally my bras are sized 30B; or XS. The bottom fit pretty well nice and snug but the top was a different story. The cups was firmly molded so for the girls of the itty bitty titty committee it would not work unless you stuff a pillow inside. I also wonder if it would work for women that are larger, would it cut into their skin because it is of a pretty hard/thick material......<br /><br />It's pretty disappointing. But st the same time it's also not for me cause my husband said I looked like I was wearing grandmas swimsuit....."
3.0,"I like the style of the dress and the material but, it ru s small."
3.0,"I may be out of date on recent trends, but it arrived wrapped in plastic and covered in grease. I wiped it down as best I could. Under the grease was quite a bit of rust.  I got the impression that I was supposed to be thrilled with this.  If this is the latest way to sell cast iron goods, I must have been asleep when the trend started. I'm too busy to send it back. It's supposed to be a gift so we'll see if the recipient is more savvy than I am."
3.0,"Costume was cute, but the ""jem stones"" fell out of the wand MINUTES after holding it. My granddaughter cried. Her mother had to take her glue gun and glued them back on"
3.0,"The ring is absolutely beautiful, I took a couple photos just to show it in different lighting but it’s much more beautiful in person then on the photos. Doesn’t feel cheap just hope it lasts for a good bit! I will update later on how well it will last!<br /><br />Update April 9 2020<br />The stone broke in half and even after super gluing it...it still fell apart. Eventually got scratched and bent. For someone who wears it everyday, and works with heavy equipment and constantly picking up things this ring did not hold up well. I would say for looks BEAUTIFUL but long lasting under working conditions...yeah thats a no from me doc."
3.0,The dress is REALLY thin and very short.  Not recommended for tall people.
3.0,Ran smaller then I was expecting but looked nice on
3.0,"I received the dress and was excited to try it on. I'm not a tiny person, wear about a size 14. I ordered an extra large and could barely get it over my shoulders. I probably needed 3 sizes larger. If you are small with a small tummy and bottom then this would be a great dress for you. Material is pretty thin but the pattern is really pretty and I would have loved to have kept it if the size were right."
3.0,"These are beautiful leather boots but were way too big. I have several pairs of the Lucky brand booties and ordered the same size in these.  My feet were swimming - I easily could have gone down a full size, maybe 1.5 sizes."
3.0,"these came in and were huge on me! if i knew they would be so big, it would be a good product but i was expecting them to be normal sized."
3.0,While the face is large the hands are difficult to see due to the dark background.
3.0,"The shorts fit me just fine, however the top ran small."
3.0,"Pretty bracelets and I will keep them, but doesn't look like hematite or a high quality of hematite that I'm used to."
3.0,"Thought these were going to be iridescent, but my son said they had glitter.  Glitter is a non starter.  Very cute, but overall didn't fit correctly."
3.0,the ring is nice since I'm a big fan of the Saints but the part that closes is to small
3.0,"I've been wanting these earrings since seeing a similar design in a catalog years ago.  I love their unique, edgy look and how easy they are to put in my ears.  A couple of problems with these though:  #1, the silver is very soft and bends easily (misshaping the earring), and #2, they slide out of my ears easily.  In hindsight, I should have spent a little more on a better quality silver.  As far as the earring slipping through the hole in my ear lobe, I guess I could use those rubber thingies, but those will show and defeats the intended appearance of the earrings."
3.0,There pins.
3.0,"Cute top, runs large but that’s due to the loose fit style. Im 5’5, 125 pounds and ordered a small. The quality was good but not light weight for summer which is what I was looking for so I returned it."
3.0,I have had a pair of this sun glasses before and really loved them but ive only had these for two weeks and the lens pop out very<br />disappointed to pay this price and dont have a pair of glasses
3.0,There do not run true to size. I wear a large and they should be loose fitting. I got a large and they don't fit so I ordered an CL and they are really tight. So I would have to get an XXL to fit normally and I'm over it.
3.0,One of the pockets is partially sewn shut but besides that it’s a pretty great dress! No other complaints!
3.0,Wear under Scrubs  rides up during the day.
3.0,Zipper gets stuck at times
3.0,Super thin flimsy material but love the front/back graphics so it will have to do for Halloween
3.0,"I do like the print and the way the top fits, but unfortunately the print doesn't match at all wherever there is a seam.  This is normally not a problem, but when the pattern is large or stripes are mismatched it's blaringly obvious.  I realize it's a low cost item and concessions have to be made, but this is just too sloppy.  I will probably return the item."
3.0,"Purchased this top in white for an outfit I was planning.  The fabric was soft and stretchy, but clingy, easily wrinkled, and see-through.  This might be ok if you purchase a size up and wear it with soft leggings, some sort of slip, or a shaper, but it didn't work for me."
3.0,"Bought it to potentially replace my leather bill fold that has stretched so much my cards fall out unless I stuff it full, an endless cycle defeating the whole purpose of a minimalist wallet.  I bought this on the off chance it would more securely hold my cards without bulking up my pocket.  Sadly this turns out to be no thinner than my bill fold when my cards are added and it lacks any division or compartments to segregate cash from credit cards from ID and insurance cards.  I also am skeptical of the physical security of the wallet as the band only holds in one direction, it seems like its only a matter of time before a car from the middle slips out and gets lost, maybe it wouldn't but it does seem like more of a risk than I am willing to take with my credit cards.  Worth a shot, but it isn't the answer I was looking for, instead I will use it to hold additional cards that I don't carry around on a daily basis."
3.0,It's small than what I have expected it to be and a little pricey for the quality of it.
3.0,"Truthfully, I should have purchased a pair with colored lenses.  The black is too serious looking for my personality.  Otherwise, they're okay😎"
3.0,It is pretty stiff but cute on.
3.0,"I love the colour, and the fabric is nice and breathable, but it's a bit on the small side."
3.0,The dress was good quality. However it was WAY too short. I am about 5 foot 4 inches.
3.0,They quality is good but they don't fit. Ordered 2 different pairs of shoes same size but these are way too small.
3.0,"It's a little bigger than I expected it to be.. but that's okay because it's really really cute and the cork comes out so you can place whatever little trinkets in it you'd like, which is really neat. You just have to squeeze the cork back in really good. It seems like it might fall out if you aren't careful. Also, the little decoration on the bottle slides off really easily so I'm going to have to glue that on, which is why I gave it 3 stars.. but over all I think it's a really cute and neat accessory"
3.0,I’ve had compression socks before. These were extremely tight they literally were cutting my circulation off. I can’t wear them and I only wore one laid 1 day.
3.0,The fit is goog
3.0,The bottoms are too cheeky for my 12 yr old. Top is cute and she loves it but 👎For the bottoms. Should mix and match
3.0,I m 5’6 and the skirt is kinda short. It’s doesn’t cover my ankles like the picture
3.0,Good quality sunglasses. Well made but extremely dark for my taste. Not good for driving.
3.0,Material is kinda ehhhh. But it's breathable. Worth the money you could say
3.0,"This runs about 2 sizes too small. I ordered a size up because of other reviews and it was still too tight, the screen printing was also cracking, but the shirt itself was a nice thick fabric and good quality."
3.0,"Very cute hat, but isn't really &#34;toddler&#34; sized. My 18 month old is almost too big for it, and the brim isn't really large enough for toddlers. Cute hat, but it's sized for infants."
3.0,"This is one of those instances where, you get what you paid for, but why pay for it?<br /><br />I bought this belt in yellow, for a little pop. It was my first venture into waist belts, so I was primarily interested in trying different things out. And I found that I really like the look of this belt and it works well with the types of dresses I wear.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is only made for a ""few"" times use. Some people may be okay with this, and the price certainly matches that quality...  however, I don't like throwing things away that quickly. By quickly I mean, I bought the belt 6 months ago and probably wore it 6 times... and a couple of those times I wore it with the faux leather already cracking and starting to flaking all over my clothes. Not very attractive. However, since this is an inexpensive belt, it is somewhat to be expected. I just wish it had lasted a little longer.<br /><br />So if you are happy with: use it, use it, chuck it in the bucket, this belt may be perfect for you."
3.0,They don't fit right.
3.0,"I purchased six pairs of MediPeds as a less expensive alternative to some of the other name brands.<br />They offer good fit and appropriate compression.<br />However, four of the socks have already worn through at the heels, even though I only wear each pair approximately once per week.<br />Rather disappointing...<br />I have ordered multiple pairs of a different, more expensive brand. Hoping they last longer than a few months..."
3.0,I bought a few of these from different sellers and they all seem the same.. but they aren't.. these are definitely a cheaper feeling version of what these are. Buy these from a different seller is my advice.
3.0,"cheap.. sorry that i have to put that but they were all wrinkled up and it's like they have some kind of spray on them that makes them stiff so with them being wrinkled up in shipping, they were horrible.."
3.0,Bought a 0-3 but got more of a 6-9 month outfit
3.0,"Petty but, the pearl's were plastic."
3.0,I guess my hole was too high? I gave it 3 stars even though I tossed these as they didn’t look good for my face but might for others. But honestly they need to go a lot lower with the middle to achieve a mustache. It just curves around the side of my nostrils. So if you have a smaller face it should work?
3.0,I am writing this from my husbands account because he surprised me with this outfit.<br /><br />I am in the process of losing weight and revamping my closet so I was excited when my husband grabbed this outfit for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Its arrived quickly with prime.<br />-The color is a teal or dark greenish-blue color but very pretty.<br />-It is very stretchy and fits super comfortable<br />-The Pants are long and touch the ground like I prefer my pants. They are also high waisted so they have an elastic band in them. I am top and bottom curvy and got an XL for reference.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Immediately when I tried it on one of the cut out holes that holds the strings popped out. I am going to have to either sew it back on or take it to the cleaners to be fixed. Its a really cute outfit but buttons should not be popping completely out before I even get a chance to wear it.<br /><br />*I Did contact amazon and they rectified the situation*
3.0,You get what you pay for. Not great quality but for the price it is acceptable
3.0,"The photo is a bit deceptive. The shirt does look the same and it is a very cute shirt but, the entire thing is see-through. This would work great to cover a swimsuit, but if you just try to wear a strapless bra you can see the bra, your belly button and stomach through the shirt. I tried wearing a cami underneath but it looked really odd and clashed with the “off the shoulder” style of the shirt."
3.0,One of these toe ring tarnished quickly and I threw it out. The rest seem fine so far!
3.0,"This is a fabulous material.  It fits a bit snug under the arms.  If it weren't for that, I would have kept it."
3.0,"The handkerchiefs are pretty and very lady like. The only problem is that some do not look like the pictures. And, They do not even match in size, color, lace and embroidery pattern. Some thin and some thick. Some are large and some are small. In fact, I have 36 handkerchiefs thats of a totally different design than each other. And most of them are not what is pictured. It seems i was sent a &#34;hodgepodge&#34; assortment of hankies. They are not for group gifting! I could not use them for what I ordered them for. i dont even want to bother with returning them. I have decided to box them for individual gifts and give them to elderly ladies. If you want the same design, color and quality Do Not Order these!"
3.0,"Really wanted to love it but the material causes everything to show!! The pockets, your undies, everything!!"
3.0,Great while I was preggo then had the baby and now they roll down my bum.
3.0,"I love the look of it, I like the pockets and the fact that it'll keep my clothes from getting ruined, but I wish it was a stiffer material, it doesn't lay right on your bady. I don't know, maybe it'll be better the more I use it."
3.0,"They were what I expected based upon the price. I actually ordered one size bigger than what I usually wear and it still fits a little snug.  The shoes arrived with a weird odor,  that has disappear over time."
3.0,It's nice but runs small
3.0,"I was looking for an earring that hugs my ear, these are too big."
3.0,"It's HUGE, bigger than I expected it to be. There is also a wrinkle in the material that I'm assuming will cause it to come undone at some point."
3.0,"It’s definitely not a perfect fit, loose Around chest but in wrong ways like I have mini wings. But I’m still glad I purchased it"
3.0,Had to give it away. Too much hassle trying to send it bavk after I was sent a mefium after ordering  a 2x.
3.0,Thin material but overall cute
3.0,"Top fit great, but v-neck was ""off."" So disappointing because it's a pretty top, pretty color. Probably will re-order and hope next one is better."
3.0,"Pretty colors, pretty design, just thin. I mean thiiiiiinnnnn lol. If you get a slip to go under it, it should be fine. Caution the wrong shapewear will give you away in this ,choose something seamless if you're wearing with a shaper anything will be brought to light,  literally."
3.0,"They do certainly look good, but suddenly snapped at the lens one day on their own after 2-3 months. I guess I got what I paid for. >_> Where do I find a higher quality version, though?"
3.0,I have a relatively short trunk and that top is barely covering my belly. The bottoms are super tight in the waist area. I'm 5'8&#34; and 150lbs and I ordered size medium as usual.
3.0,You can tell the quality isn't on par with Adidas and Nike but they aren't terrible. These are like those generic shorts you get with fake soccer kits...they ight.
3.0,The pants fit well. I like that unlike the floral pants they don’t drag on the floor.
3.0,The rolled down my legs all night. Thankfully I will only need them once.
3.0,"I like this. Light weight, It fits well. I did not have to sew the ear holes smaller or tighten up the back so that it wouldn't slide down.  I just wish that the skeleton was closer to the top so that it could be seen, at least on me. The best part is hidden where it folds on my neck and chest"
3.0,I don’t think it tracks or calculates your heart rate accurately- or it takes forever for my heart rate to register during a high intensity workout.
3.0,Got them for my 9 year old.  They fit but are short.
3.0,Shoulders are huge.....
3.0,I bought 5 of these for my children’s clinic and they are perfect — EXCEPT for the super strong chemical smell that they all have!  :(  I have washed them and they still smell so strong that I worry I can’t use them for what I intended. Such a bummer! I’m surprised none of the other reviews have mentioned the smell.
3.0,Very cute but broke in about a month
3.0,"Looks beautiful, feels nice to the touch, is soft and elegant. BUT - it is so so large and boxy. I will be returning it only for that reason."
3.0,"It's a bit close around the chest and neck, and way too loose through the torso. If you like that style, this dress is for you, but I wasn't a fan."
3.0,Fits fine except in the crotch area a little too snug and I’m just an Average guy
3.0,"The graphics on the shirt are funny, but the size and material are off the mark. The shirt is too small and not long enough. The company they used for the shirt definitely did not use standard sizing. The XL fits like a large and is 3-inches too short at the bottom hem. The material itself is near threadbare already. They should have gone with a 5.5 oz to 6.1 oz shirt, which is the standard for imprintables."
3.0,This is my third pair of these gloves in the past 12 months. I use them to work underwater as a scuba diver for the state. The last pair I got the right hand fit like a 2XL but the left hand fit more like 3XL-4XL. They're great gloves other than the inconsistent sizing.
3.0,"The fabric is too thin.  I would prefer not to wear a tank top under it, especially in the summer."
3.0,It is minimally as expected. The front and rear pockets were to shallow in depth but the front cargo pockets were acceptable.
3.0,"They fit perfectly, but they started squeaking by the second wearing."
3.0,I have both the regular and lite mesh  Drymax running socks.  I prefer the regular ones for my hiking or walking shoes.
3.0,this dress is super cheap looking... didn’t keep it
3.0,"Material was too thin, style a bit different."
3.0,"Cute and cheap for when needed in a pinch. I took the padding out of the top because you could see it through the fabric - it looks and feels better without it and you can’t see your chest even without the pads. It doesn’t have a lot of stretch to it, so if you are squeezing into it, you’ll hear the ruching seams rip and it leaves an uneven pattern where the seams were compromised. It doesn’t leave holes but the ruching comes undone."
3.0,I’m an average sized dude and these were alittle on the smaller size I would get a size bigger good material though
3.0,"I think the quality is probably great, even though they seem a little thin to me.  Also, because of the one size fits some, they don't really work as compression sleeves on me as they are rather loose. I am 5' 6&#34; and weigh about 145 lbs. The will keep my arms warm, though, when I need a sleeve, so am keeping."
3.0,"The top fit just fine, but the bottom is way too long. So long that the only way it wouldnt drag the ground is for me to wear the waistline on my shoulders! I am 5'8"", so too long has never been a problem for me. Cmon.... Really tho....."
3.0,"Very pretty, shiny and cute but uncomfortable to sleep with, and not too convenient to change out before bed each night. Also keeps turning in your ear and needs constant adjustment to look right."
3.0,"Sadly I got the skirt before they fixed  the true sizes, so my skirt was way to small, but the skirt was beautiful and light weight (good for summer)"
3.0,Cute dress not bad for the price but the sleeves were so incredibly tight I cut them off
3.0,"When you open them they are in a nice white leather case that I think I will keep for my nicer sunglasses.  I was amazed at how flat they are and surprised there is not curve to these glasses at all.  They do not wrap around your head, they are all square corners.  That being said for this price point they are functional and I could use them as sunglasses.  I have purchased sunglasses at the same price point that have felt sturdier and I believe will last longer but at this price point I feel like it is a lot more of a gamble what you are going to get.  If you want cheap aviator style sunglasses that are very flat these work, just don't expect them to last well."
3.0,A lot bigger than it seems.  Make sure you read the dimensions of this before ordering.
3.0,Get it if you look like the model. The large on me looked very boxy.
3.0,"So these are cute if they match an outfit or costume, but you can't work at a desk with them on. They are too clunky and chunky. If they hit counters, doors, or anything else too much they start to chip and the paint comes off showing the wood below. That could be a look you want or are going for, but that isn't what the designer had planned."
3.0,"Super soft and fit perfectly, for the girls and the dolls...BUT both of them ripped extremely fast. One of them two days after Christmas while she was sleeping and the other New Year’s Day while playing hide and seek, so neither of them were doing anything crazy.  Thank god I can sew because both of the girls were extremely sad about it."
3.0,Looks okay but was not what I expected
3.0,"It didn't cover my rear end or the front.  I get that it is lingerie but, but a &#34;dress&#34; as described it is not.  I intended to wear it with leggings anyway so it worked out."
3.0,Beautiful stone but back fell off fast
3.0,"Quality seems okay, but out of the three prints we ordered, we only received one as the other two were not what was ordered. Too close to school to return."
3.0,Poorly made and kinda tight
3.0,Those sunglasses are good for style but my eyes ache when I put them on
3.0,Just to short for me and tight
3.0,"The reason I can't give this 5 stars is the sizing. I usually wear US medium but ordered large in this the first time and had to return it. I loosened the ribbon on the back as far as I could and still couldn't close it. I ended up getting a 2x and it fits. They need to fix their size chart because it is inaccurate. I am pregnant, but even if I wasn't it still would have been way too small. My belly isn't big yet! I would suggest ordering two sizes up from your usual size."
3.0,Dress fits big.
3.0,Beautiful shirt too small in a X Large
3.0,Nice product but runs small
3.0,"It's nice combination color of dress! Quality doesn't look expensive !<br />I retuned due the size not actuate as described. Don't follow Amazon size chart. I'm 116lbs, bust 35, waist 27, hips 37. Ordered size small ,it's too tight"
3.0,"It's nice, but it is a little bigger than expected."
3.0,I didn't like the color. The picture cleary shows red but it was burgundy
3.0,"The charm itself is lovely, however the glow in the dark ball was not attached to the firefly! I wanted to love it😟"
3.0,These were purchased for my 7 month old granddaughter. They are much too big for her.  They may fit when she's a toddler.
3.0,Sorry I returned this.
3.0,"It’s a beautiful gown but the front doesn’t lay nicely, show boobs"
3.0,Quality of product seemed fine but I ordered black but was sent green in a box labeled black. Exchanged it and got another green in box labeled black. Maybe I should’ve ordered green to get black. 🤷🏻‍♂️
3.0,Wasn't expecting it to be so tiny. It was so small that you could barely tell it was a carrot.
3.0,"The biggest issue with this is that the shoulder strap only has a single pivot, causing it to tangle and strain the strap fairly easy. This brand makes VERY durable products, and this bag is no exception, but it is rather heavy in exchange and the strap is obnoxious. A good buy if you want a sturdy, spacious protective computer bag"
3.0,"Very pretty, but are small in size, look like something that would fit a 10 year old."
3.0,"These shorts are made with great material, I just wish they were fit to the correct size. I had to stitch them up a bit so that they would not fall off in the pool. Plus, the legs of these are no where near what is pictured. They might as well be one piece swimsuit bottoms."
3.0,Thin but ok
3.0,"The fit is true to size.  Daughter is 4 years old (but in the 20th percentile for height and weight) and this is a size 5; there's a bit of droop, but she'll grow into it.  That said, we have other leos that are ""4-6"" that fit fine.  The issue is that while the material is stretchy, it's not quite elastic; it's more of a cottony material so size accordingly.  However, overall, just a so-so value for an Amazon branded product."
3.0,"This is a lovely versatile piece but the sizing is definitely wrong!!!!!! I ordered an XL and it fits a size M/L body type. My client could not even get her arms in, so I would suggest going a size or two up. Also if you have bigger arms  this might not be the garment for you."
3.0,These are ok for the price.  They are for a costume party.  Not for every day of course.  They fit well.
3.0,"Very nice shirts but, two out of the three Flair at the armpit area. If it wasn't a gym shirt I will be more upset about it but forewarning for anybody looking to buy this"
3.0,"It worked for what I needed however, I had to engineer and safety pin it to a bra so that my breasts weren’t exposed. That is my only complaint I was constantly readjusting and pulling upwards."
3.0,Pretty but way small....
3.0,Can't read this watch.... gold on gold
3.0,"The item looks great out of the package, but the fit is all wrong.  It doesn’t drape and flow like it does in the picture. The arm openings are also quite small.  I’m thinking this product would only work well for someone that wears an XSmall or small top."
3.0,"I was unsure on sizing so got an xl, too loose up top for my liking - and I’m not a firm fitting kinda girl. Wasn’t super impressed by the material though it might make a nice island vacation kind of dress. One thing missing was definitely pockets. That could have made the difference in my keeping it. I didn’t."
3.0,Me gusta mucho la calidad son muy cómodas se ajustan a tu cuerpo pero le doy 3 estrellas porque se enrollan y soy XL y ordene ML y pensé que te presionaba pero no fue así las compre para soportar mi espalda yo creo lo que tal ves la S puede que presione
3.0,The earrings are cute but the backs are so small you can hardly pick them up.
3.0,Fit well look cheap.
3.0,I ordered 5 sets for our family and only 4 came with the socks.... This is very disappointing and unfortunately I didn't realize it until now they day before I am going to use them....
3.0,"Have had this almost 4 months and material has held up (no scratches or tears) and the straps haven't torn. However I noticed the other day that the coloring is starting to wear off on the straps. Overall a decent value for an inexpensive purse I suppose, just not sure how long it will hold up."
3.0,Extremely tight/small.. See-through. But cute.
3.0,These are pretty but much smaller than expected
3.0,"Not very excited about this purchase. They are somewhat see-through in the black color.  They are not stretchy at all except for the waist band, and they are tight in all the wrong places. I have a curvy backside and normally things are tighter there but in this case the backside was loose with the waist and legs being tighter. I am 5’3, 180lbs and usually wear a 14 or 16. These were purchased in an XL but I think I’d need a XXX to actually fit which is not the case with any other clothing I own.<br /><br /> I will likely return these."
3.0,Too small. Very uncomfortable. Dissapointed.
3.0,"I ordered a size small, received a medium. They fit okay but a small would've been ideal. They're very soft. Arrived on time. Caution: dry clean only. I seemed to have missed that detail in the description. Who sends their yoga shorts to the dry cleaners?"
3.0,"No lie. We put it up in only slightly breezy conditions and the pole gave out and it bent right over onto my wife who was in the hammock.<br /><br />That said... I did have it in a stand that was lower than your average outdoor table and it bent right at the table top. Still upon examination, the material the pole is made of is quite thin.<br /><br />I have since sawed off the bad part and filled the lower tube with ready mix concrete. It's been solid as a rock since ;~)"
3.0,Sox
3.0,Nice glasses - frames too big for my small face.
3.0,"too revealing and see through for me, seemed a little cheaply made."
3.0,Too snug for an XL which I normally wear.
3.0,Shorter than I thought but other than that I think it will be ok. I haven’t worn or washed it yet though.
3.0,Loose around my wrist
3.0,"Bought these for my husband and he doesn’t like them. They sit far too high on his nose and look strange. He also can’t read his phone with them on, and that is frustrating."
3.0,"I purchased this top in the yellow . I t is very thin you can see completely through it . I am keeping it because it's not worth sending back . Not happy with it at all . The color is pretty , and the style not bad but the fabric is very thin ."
3.0,Bootsy style but way to big for me and i have a big head
3.0,Not true to size at all. Extra extra small
3.0,I like these but wish they were a little bigger.
3.0,"After reading all reviews, I decided to get the M size.  I am  5'3&#34;, 112 Ibs, and it fits fine. I got the navy blue with bright pink a cent color and it is pretty.  Lining is a bit thick and the pads were not attached.  A few stitches fixed it.  I washed it at night and left it in the shower to dry.  To my surprise, when I went to put it away the next day around 10:00 am,  it was not dry yet! Had to leave it in the sun to dry out.  I guess, one cannot walk around in it after getting out of the pool or on the beach, without changing It, which at times is not really possible!<br />Also, there were some loose treads here and there and the inside finish wasn't clean enough.  Hope it does not unravel too quickly.  I guess you get what you pay for!"
3.0,This product was cute and came as described. The reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the packaging. It came in a small box which caused the hat to come bent up and not be able to shape it the way it is supposed to be.
3.0,"I didn’t even have her try this on because the buttons were so hard for me as an adult to get them undone. I did not want her to get attached to the coat and then get frustrated trying to Button the coat. A coat should not be hard for a four-year-old to button, let alone a 67-year-old. So I returned it in hopes of finding something that the four-year-old will be able to button and unbuttoned by herself without any frustration and still love the coat."
3.0,Not Oakley X-Metal Earsocks they fit ok... but high price for a cheap knockoff. they slip when you sweat not like the real deal.
3.0,Delivery was fast . The only reason why Im giving 3 stars is because I had a lot of duplicates and they claim different.. I dont plan on repurchasing. I had maybe 2 or 3 that the balls were broken .. I haven't contact customer service so I cant rate on that.. you get what you pay for.
3.0,The sleeves are incredibly tight and the shirt itself is really loose. Sizing didn't match up with size chart in my opinion. Very cute blouse- just wish it fit!
3.0,pins in hinges started falling out in one week.  my daughter is 9 and plays very nicely and not tons of towing around and didn't stand up as much as I expected for price.
3.0,"the ""pearl"" is obviously a piece of plastic it doesn't even have a pearl finish its a little bulky i got it because it has a peacock feather on it it feels heavy but no stamp and no idea what kind of metal its made out of. For the price (about $5 with the shipping) its cute."
3.0,Tight.  My calves are 18 inches around and these are not very comfy.
3.0,"Not bad, not great, just made for a large head size in my opinion"
3.0,"Shoe is very cute but I had to cut the strap off because it was digging into my daughters foot so bad it was giving her a blister. Besides that, they got great."
3.0,Too big for my face but use now and again when needed. Hard to buy stuff you can't try on but mostly a personal preference not the product.
3.0,Only I of the lenses are polarized and are mad with cheap plastic but fit in and looks good
3.0,"Not for me.  Smaller than expected.  No longer in my drawer.  Otherwise, the build quality was fine."
3.0,"I bought these with a little fun in mind but it might be one sided.  As a male with average wrists, these will barely clasp.  Keep that in mind if you are a guy hoping to be the one chained to the bedpost."
3.0,It is ok. But it is not the color i sent for and the packaging not good at all.
3.0,hardware brakes easily
3.0,Cheap made... don’t recommend
3.0,"These are ok but quite poor quality, guess you only get what you pay for"
3.0,"This is so me !💖 Just got it yesterday and I'm in love with it. Unfortunately, It's been a couple weeks now and it's beginning to fade. Oh well..."
3.0,It good but too small
3.0,As seen.... small and dainty but seems well made good for silky scarves.  Nice
3.0,"Bought it for my son and my husband. It was way too big, it's not the average stocking cap."
3.0,"These are very snug. If you are bottom heavy order a size up. You can not wear these like regular leggings, they are very sheer after you get them on. The band around the ankle also seems a bit tighter. They roll at the waist also and when they do push on your abdomen when you sit. I found these to be a bit uncomfortable. Not like other ones I have worn."
3.0,A little on the short side & order a size larger!!
3.0,"I knew the bottoms would be tight but I was hoping the top was a bit smaller. The elastic around the chest (under the boobs/the bottom of the top?) feels worn out which is strange since the elastic around the thighs are out for revenge.<br />Despite that, this swimsuit is gorgeous! I think I am going to sew elastic into the top to make it fit and try to stretch out the elastic on the thighs a bit.<br />For reference I have 32D and am a size 7 (6 normally but haven't been careful post Christmas)"
3.0,Material has curten-like non gentle feel. Fits trie to size. The pattern on green skirt is not exactly what i expected. But generally skirt looks nice from far if irond. ))
3.0,"Was going to use for gym work out...they did arrive promptly, however, they fit rather small and I cannot wear...but on a good note, my wife can."
3.0,"The ring was pretty, it was definitely a large stone but I was okay with that it was the color that bothered me. It was a definite green turquoise as opposed to a blue turquoise. Which doesn't mean much except that it didn't match anything that I owned. Personal preference. I will be returning it. On a side note, I have a ton of jewelry from Jude Jewelers and I have no complaints about any of it. I am sure that I would have felt the same about this ring had it not been for the color."
3.0,Im a C this was a lot of material in the cup not sure if a smaller size would have been better.
3.0,"I don't like the way the ankle cuff is designed,the little metal squares look off"
3.0,"I rated only for the fast shipping, the dress was too big although I ordered size S."
3.0,Fits loose on the top of my key but its super duper cute.
3.0,"First let me start by saying this top is super cute it looks just like the picture, but maybe a little bit more sheer. That being said the top is way too small in the arms and shoulders. I would have loved to wear it but I will have to find a smaller person to give it to. I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,"The fit was perfect for my daughter , but she does have a narrow foot that many shoes do not fit well.<br />Quality of the shoe is not great for multiple wears. They are beautiful shoes, but they fall apart after only a few times being worn. The bows came off and the jewel strips started coming off after 3/4 wears.<br />I would still purchase again for special event wear."
3.0,"It’s a beautiful dress overall. Love the style and really love the pockets. It runs very small, I should have sized up at least 3 sizes. The company did try their hardest with suggestions on alterations."
3.0,It is a little on the small side. My daughter is an 8 so I bought the 10/12 and its snug. She was disappointed that the bathing suit she received was blue as opposed to the picture on Amazon which shows it as being black.
3.0,This shirt was ordered for one of my sisters and she said it was too tight around the neck. I told her I would return it but she has not asked me to.
3.0,"This was bigger than I expected, and extremely light , almost feels and sounds like made out of tin. It's ok, very eye-catching though."
3.0,"These aren't very good quality for the price.  For $25, I would expect a softer feeling fur.  The fur is a bit on the long, silky side, but not very plush. Warmth is ok, not as good as it could be."
3.0,"It's probably cuz of the placement of my piercings, but it wrapped snug around in one ear and a tad looser on the other, which was more comfortable. Keep in mind the length of this earring from the needle to the bottom"
3.0,So the shorts are giant on my 6 year old and the shirt is too small for my 3 year old. Why are these giant shorts paid with a tiny shirt? It is a belly shirt? I don't know how to rate this for size.
3.0,"Dress looks beautiful online, but looks much cheaper once it arrives. I ordered my normal size and couldn't get it zipped up around my rib cage...not even close to zipped. I ordered the dress with extra length to be safe and it was extremelyyy long. Typically this would be great because  dresses are usually too short (I'm 6'0), but I would've needed to get it hemmed quite a bit just so I could walk without tripping on myself."
3.0,the arm holes were to big my tits hang out but then it is tight around my midsection
3.0,"These were bought for my husband.  They worked well for him at work, but within two months the strap broke where it attaches to the glasses.  I bought these as a trial run before buying the name brand.  I guess it’s time."
3.0,"I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color. Unfortunately, this one arrived with very poor side stitching. It looks like someone sewed the sides by hand as can be seen from the photo. Other than this, they are the same as every other one I ordered.<br /><br />Note that they wash well in a lingerie bag but I lay them flat to dry."
3.0,"The sweater is ok, looks nice from the distance but in close inspection doesn’t seems so high quality, looks a bit so-so  about the cloth. The inside is warm but looks a bit cheap. Not bad in general, I use it for very casual outfits."
3.0,The bracelet itself is beautiful but the chain/clasp keeps breaking. I wore it twice.
3.0,Great aid when you need those extra few inches at the waist line.
3.0,was weird around the chest and shoulders. the padding is weird
3.0,Too small pretty nice slippers
3.0,"I thought the design of this dress was cute, and because it's unlike anything else I own, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I ordered the Medium size based on the measurement chart, and while the dress did fit well, the skirt material was just not soft enough to lay nicely.  It was so puffy in the back, I felt like I was wearing a bustle!  Needless to say, I didn't think a poofy behind was very becoming, so I returned the dress.<br /><br />If the design could be improved, I'd recommend the following:<br />1) Solid and patterned &#34;shirts&#34; (not everyone looks good in stripes)<br />2) Softer material for the &#34;skirt&#34;"
3.0,we have to Belize once with them and to Washington 2 or 3 time. zipper worked good  enough room for all you need to pack.  a little flimsy scratch a little maybe not good for a world traveler
3.0,This really was a well made skirt.  Great prove but...  I am 5'11 and the skirt well 4'' too long! Did not want to pay for alterations. Runs small also.  Wanted to buy it and m wearing it.  Not put extra money in to it.
3.0,"Fit my 8 year old, I wouldn't recommend for an adult size foot."
3.0,"The product came in a box without any protective shipping materials. Perhaps from the box movement while being shipped, one the glass of the watch was cracked. The product was shipped overseas and I’m waiting on to see if the watch works at all."
3.0,its a lot smaller than it should be.
3.0,This shirt runs at least one size small
3.0,I love my Bogg Bag and its accessories. After my anchor accessory broke I decided to purchase the K one for my daughters' initials. It did not live up to my expectations. Even thought it is very well made and cute; it arrived looked a bit used and dirty.  The item itself is well made and pretty but the quality control was not up to par on this one.
3.0,"THIS HANDBAG IS OK, BUT I FIND IT TOO LARGE!  The one-way zippers are inconvenient, and there is no particular organization for my plastic."
3.0,I really thought the idea was cute but you can't read the writing but for the price u still get a cute picture!
3.0,"The belt is very odd. It is hard to figure out. The pocket isn't attached to the skirt and is supposed to clip on, though there isn't any indication of where. The skirt is better without the belt and pocket."
3.0,Cute but this dress isn't worth more that $5
3.0,"Nice fit, very comfortable. Good weight for summer. Definitely over priced."
3.0,Hated the pockets
3.0,Missing Product
3.0,"Gold wore off after a while, but I guess that should be expected."
3.0,They are fine. I don’t really like the material or the metal at the end of the drawstrings.
3.0,Pretty small for an extra large. I usually wear a large but I'm glad I ordered the extra large. Runs small.
3.0,Super cute and I love the fit however it’s very see through and I got even got the black color. I figured it might be cute over a swimsuit so I kept it.
3.0,The style is very cute and the print is nice. The material was not what I expected. Feels like those cheap nightgowns I used to wear as a kid. I’m kind of scared to wash it.
3.0,Item not at described.  Earrings are short and does not reach your shoulder as described. Could be a little longer
3.0,Shinier than I expected and too big for my small wrist. gave it to my sister in law and she likes it.
3.0,"I loved the band, but it was tough to put on the watch.  I got it on but it broke shortly.  Lasted a month and a half.<br /><br />I took it to my friend, a jeweler, who redid the screws, and it has been fine since."
3.0,"I like the Jersey, but not the fit.  The sizing chart (even ordering up a size) was not correct."
3.0,"This is a fine bathrobe - soft, long, and provides full coverage.  If it continued to look the way it did when I first put it on, I'd be thrilled.  However, this garment fades and begins to show signs of wear after wash #1. The crummy part is now that I've washed it, I can't return it."
3.0,Too big. I usually wear small. This tshirt is too loose and long.
3.0,"i liked it but the second day of putting it on, it broke"
3.0,the picture here is just hanging on a very small frame shame on the seller for doing this it makes it look way bigger then it is ....this is cute but very very small  something for a child to wear in play dress up
3.0,"These were a lot larger than I expected, but the do perform the way they should"
3.0,"Pros: cute colors, soft, not too thick so my feet don’t get toasted like in some other slippers I own.<br /><br />Cons: too wide even for my wide feet, although the length matches the size. The inner sole is not attached to the sleepers and it instantly makes them feel unfinished.<br /><br />Bottomline: I am keeping mine since I already started wearing them and they are not too bad, but I wouldn’t buy them again."
3.0,"I didn't like the fit, the quality and price was good enough for me."
3.0,Nice earrings but it's very difficult to close the clasp I don't wear them often and will probably get rid of them
3.0,I did not expect these Tesla compression baselayer shirts to affect my blood pressure. even after I took them off. I have had to limit the time I wear them.
3.0,The buttons are on the left hand side I don't like that...
3.0,"Love the socks, but way too small for the person I bought them for."
3.0,"This hat doesn't fit as the picture suggests it will, or at least I've never figured out how to make it stay like that. Still a lovely and warm hat that I've worn a great deal."
3.0,"Cute shirt. Fit well. Stayed the same size after washing. Only washed the shirt once before wearing it to a Christmas themed float trip. That was not enough. It felt itchy and when my boyfriend looked at my back, I had a rash. Too nervous to wear it again. Maybe after washing it 5 more times..."
3.0,I gave this to my bestfriend for her birthday. Smaller than I expected and it broke within a week.
3.0,Not sure yet Smaller than I thought Little difficult on closing Will update after had chance to use
3.0,for $1 apiece
3.0,Top is more like a mock turtleneck.  After washing 3 times (cold water) it is fading.
3.0,They are fine. But I have arthritis and now wish I'd bought battery operated set.
3.0,"Fit as expected and comfortable. I ended up returning the item as I liked another sweater just a little more, but I have seen others wear this sweater and it is stylish and cute."
3.0,"These are cute, however once my baby starts wearing them I don't see them being very comfortable."
3.0,I really like these glasses but they fit a little tight around the sides of my head. They look really good though. ;)
3.0,This item broke maybe only two weeks after I wore it for the first time.
3.0,I get so many compliments on this strap... but in the time of owning it it has fallen off from the pin 3 times. On the third time I had to call it a day as I am not prepared to lose my watch.
3.0,I like it but it does not sound like yeet at all when you push the button. It more sounds like a child that cant talk yet trying to yell eat but not doing a very good job. So if that does not bother you then its fine.
3.0,These earrings were defective when I received them and one of of the stones was missing!
3.0,"I was not really impressed with these gloves.<br /><br />They are very soft but very thin. The design is cute in that the long wrist unfolds to make the gloves really long. But if the wrist area is folded down ( and kind of secured by a thumb hole, the gloves are then very short.  When folded down the excess material lies over the palm. But since it just sits there, the excess material gets caught up on whatever you happen to pick up.<br /><br />The Forefinger and thumb have pads on them so you can use a touch screen.<br /><br />Overall a Cute concept and design, but in production it has some flaws. I would say pass on this product."
3.0,Way too big for a 3month old.
3.0,The shoes were too small and I sent them back. Please send me a refund. Thank you.
3.0,"The top fits well, the bottom not so much."
3.0,I didn’t notice any improvement in my vision while driving at night. I had my daughter-in-law try them and she didn’t notice a difference either. It was the same with them on as it was with them off. I would return them except I didn’t keep any of the packaging.
3.0,Idk who measures these products before they send them out but apparently no one does. The bottoms look like smalls where the top is barely an XL.<br />Material is nice but these went straight into the yard sale bin.
3.0,Fit perfectly looks nice but maybe should have ordered an xlrg.  And material was not as thick and cotton as I thought but overall I like it.
3.0,"These are fun little lights for when the grandkids come, assuming your kids are old enough to be safe with the tiny size.  The batteries don't last long but, for the price and the number you get, it was still worth it for the fun of having little lights on all of our fingers.  I have used them to find things in my purse at night."
3.0,They are very cute but the metal gets WAY to hot. I couldn't wear them outside tanning for more than 30 mins.
3.0,They were bigger than I thought but were liked by my granddaughter.
3.0,They are a weird material.  Too tight.  And the crock buttons fall out.  Lastly. Yes I did buy a second pair two sizes bigger and it fit better. Still tight and he got a weird rash.  Not happy.
3.0,very flimsy and fragile<br />not worth it
3.0,"Way too big for me. It's nice, and didn't come damaged but it's way too large for me to wear."
3.0,It's too short. But it looks great.
3.0,Good quality construction. The molded cups are all wrong for me. Molded cup bras never work for me. Should have thought of that. Sending it back.
3.0,"They are thinner than pictured. The earrings are okay, but not what I expected. Returned."
3.0,"Runs a little small, but the quality is really good.  I love the color and the material.  Very comfortable.  Definitely would purchase more colors."
3.0,ITS LOOKS CHEAP
3.0,"This hat is so cute, but way tight. I don't consider myself to have a large head either. It's adjustable, but only to be smaller. I don't understand why they wouldn't make it adjustable both ways. I hope they change this feature in the future. Super bummed as I really liked it."
3.0,They just have to be washed a few times to loosen up
3.0,"Hat was a bit small, but my fault (I was between 2 sizes & ordered the smaller one based on a review I'd read).  The size (in cm) was accurate, however, so if you're between 2 sizes, order the larger."
3.0,Kind of rolls but over all comfy
3.0,The product was good as described but the color was a little off.
3.0,"I bought these and think they are very cute, and at 20$something compared to 50-70$ selling elsewhere the price on Amazon make them even better... The only thing I am disappointed in is the rings on these shoes, where the rainbow ribbon runs through is corroded and looks like the silver is peeling off of them, I would be very angry if I had paid full price for these."
3.0,"Cute embroidery, but the zipper broke when I tried it on."
3.0,"The sweatshirt fits ok.  As previous reviews stated, the arms are a little long but ok.  The material is thinner than what I expected.  Would be ok for light fall but I am buying for winter.  I bought the light gray color and the waistband was a different tone of gray than the rest of the sweatshirt which I did not like much, otherwise; I might have kept it to wear in the fall."
3.0,If you have very short toes these may work for you.  I have average length toes and I am typically a size 7 but toes were hanging off -eww
3.0,To tight and could not wear it for my son’s wedding.
3.0,"Bought for exercising, yard work, fishing, hunting...  This fits as expected*, wicks sweat away very well, and is comfortable.  Biggest issue is with the neckline - it’s been loose and saggy since I got it.  Tried wash/dry on high and doesn’t seem to work.  Works great as a base layer though."
3.0,Im a man and they fit perfect.  Disappointed that they kept slipping down during the light jog and/or walking.  Could use better elasticity at the top.
3.0,"My husband really likes wearing them, and I like that you can buy different colors in one purchase as these aren't that common, however he got a hole in one of them the very first day he wore them and the seams seem to be falling apart. The other two seem ok so far, so I may buy them again in the future to see if this was a one time defect, and, if so, change my review then, but as of now I can only give 3 stars."
3.0,"I bought this for my husband for an Oscar party. Super cheap and tacky, I would never use it for a real black tie event. Thank goodness it was just a costume party"
3.0,Made for Shrek-sized faces. Hoping they'll shrink in the wash.
3.0,"Structurally they are made well, seem quite strong and won't easily break under the clumsiness of a child. Tint of the lens isn't too dark and the rubber arms and nose piece will help keep them on a child when they swat. Wrap around the face to provide as much protection as possible.<br /><br />Why only 3-stars? Because they don't fit my kids face well. They wear cheap shades that they give away during events or ones that you can by for five bucks at a mega store. But these don't fit my 4 or 7 year old. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the nose piece. It doesn't sit on my older kids nose, the lenses actually sit on her cheeks. So I think if your kid doesn't have a small nose or a flat kinda nose they should fit fine. Also my 4 year old is pretty skinny so may be a small face is an issue as well."
3.0,Ordered these for my sons. I was very excited!!  Reality….  Very disappointed that the card with saying was not included.
3.0,"I'm not even 5ft talk and the small fits well and is a good length. The picture on Amazon didn't show a patch which is why I picked this I've, but it arrived with a Hufflepuff patch on it. The yellow fabric liner is very thin and looks dingy with black behind it. We'll work for a costume but was hoping for a brighter yellow and no patch to be a little more authentic for my trip to the Harry Potter: Forbidden Forest Experience."
3.0,"For the price I shouldn't expect a lot, but at least I would like get item from the photo. My bow part is very, very tiny so it doesn't look anything like one on the picture. Other thing I really don't like is that parts of necklace turn around while wearing, maybe chain is slightly to short for me or something, but it is still very annoying."
3.0,"Convenient, but thin.  Don't think it will stop a virus but it covers your face and is convenient to take down and put back up without having to hang onto it.  Polyester or nylon type material can be a bit warm even though it is thin.  Works well for atv riding to keep grit out of your mouth and nose."
3.0,The top is a bit to small and I am C-cup.<br />It is a bit cheaply made and not cut properly. I may still be able to wear it
3.0,"Was as pictured, but it states unisex and i just don't feel like the mask works for a large man. It's for small faces."
3.0,"Should of listened to other reviews,  order a size larger"
3.0,The bottoms fit me (I’m usually a 6 in jeans) but the top (I’m a 36DDD) is not really wearable unless I have a bra under.
3.0,The dress fits well but the black parts stretch when you put it on and it looks gray. I bought a medium. Maybe I'll try it in white to avoid this issue. For the price it's not a bad work dress.
3.0,These shoes are very heavy and fit small for their size.  My son wears a 13 and I ordered the 1 and if it were up to me I'd return them for a larger size but he was too excited to try them.  They are very tight.
3.0,"Cute sandal Good quality , be sure to order a size up !"
3.0,The Q-PIDS have the engraving on one side but are hollowed out in the back. So they feel kind of light weight and cheap.
3.0,Runs very very small. Very nice material soft and comfy. I normally wear a large ordered an xl because I read reviews that said ran small. Had to return xl and get an xxl hopefully that one works.
3.0,Outfit is real but runs real small
3.0,"They're ok.  Not as flowy as shown in pic, more straight. Although I ordered according to their measurement chart, the fit was still a bit small.  More dress length, but will be ok over leggings.  I suggest you order bigger than you think you need.  Material is nice, not thin or see thru."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:a18155a5846e48e64f7e1c1b87a49587]] It’s really on me that i didn’t measure and think through how long 118” really is!  It really isn’t wide enough to efficiently provide back support or act as a waist corset. The multiple thinner fabric wraps around and around and ends up slipping up or down and your body fat squeezes out between the layers which is not flattering and to me defeats the purpose of a waist cincher!  There are so many hooks that it is slightly difficult to get them all hooked in a straight row!
3.0,Ordered an 3XL as per sizing it would be overly big on me. It’s not it’s actually snug. Turns out it’s meant for Asian women from what I’m taking from the tag. The side strings will pull back up into the string pockets unless you triple knot them. The seams are also coming apart and I’ve resewn one side seam already.
3.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and a thin-to-medium build and I like the fit: sleeves cover the wrist, and the length is mid-calf. However, the robe is 100% polyester and not very thick, so it's mostly useful as a fair-weather cover-up. It's not what I would consider a winter-time robe."
3.0,Run small order size up
3.0,Needs a zipper
3.0,"These are not yoga pants. Yes, they are stretchy. However, they are shiny, SATIN. I am not sure who would wear them out of the house for exercise. They look like satin pajama pants. I would give them 1 star because they clearly are not what the photo looks like (nowhere do I see that these are thin satin). However, my fiance likes them because they are comfortable, so we are keeping them. But, for $18.99 realize that you are getting stretchy thin satin pants that look like pajama pants."
3.0,The color is a little off!!! All in all I like the dress!!! Comfortable and stylish....
3.0,Returned it.  Too small in the waist.
3.0,I love the style though they are a bit heavy to wear all day for me.
3.0,"The model must be very tiny.  This dress fits me better than expected with the hem hitting just below the knee (I'm 5' 6-1/2&#34;) and the sleeves are not as long as on the model, nor does it hang off the shoulders.  It is very cute but the care instructions are very difficult.  Before you buy consider this; it can be washed on delicate cycle cold water but must hang to dry and then be ironed inside out with a cool iron.  I'm not good at ironing and it's not a chore I like to do.  I worked and worked on this but it  has three flounces below the waist and except for the bottom one are almost impossible to iron."
3.0,They came quickly and I was happy. Today was the first day I was going to wear them and they had a scratch in the lenses.
3.0,Material was thin and didn’t hang right
3.0,"This is cute. Another pinky ring. However, the cat looks more like a lizard. I like the adjustable feature and the fact that it is sterling. I'm going to wear it even tho it does look like a lizard, maybe it will be a conversation starter! It is very very tiny."
3.0,Good looking attractive shoe. But the straps keep coming off.
3.0,Son felt the surprise giftwastoo &#34;girly&#34;.
3.0,"Wow. I went by the reviews but only ordered 1 size up - when most were recommending 2 sizes up and these overalls were HUGE!!! I'm going to have to order 1 size DOWN. They are very cute for the price but size description is so wrong, also they are not stretchy and are a bit heavy, but that might have been because of the size. Sending back."
3.0,Kind of weird.... there is a zipper in the middle of the shirt .... that just looks out of place.... I wasn't  paying attention  when I ordered  it ... but there  is . ...it is cute tho
3.0,About 3 weeks in and one eyelet for the laces has come out already. Not the best quality. They fit good. Lights are great.
3.0,To much athletic wear not enough bra.
3.0,"CONS<br />-fits a ring size of 5. (Cannot be adjusted) if you try to squeeze the ring to tighten, it just goes back to its original size.<br />-out of the 60,  12  did NOT work."
3.0,This swimsuit Fit the way I’d hoped. It covers her tummy. However the color of the bottoms is way brighter than I expected. They are more of a neon coral color.
3.0,"I bought these with the hope that they'd be as real as diamonds. Obviously, those are unrealistic expectations. However, I am still disappointed that they were as mediocre as they actually are. Although the cz is good, the backs on these things are super thin and poor quality. If you look at them up close, they look like toy jewelry. Also, they sort of droop down when you wear them. However, I guess they are ok for temporary wear and if nobody looks closely. But for me, I am returning them tomorrow."
3.0,I like the dress but the materiel is very thin.  Not what I expected but overall it will be ok.
3.0,Has a rough spot that becomes uncomfortable after about 8 hrs
3.0,Shorts are lightweight a bit too lightweight for diving; very thin material. Dive flag design is perfect but they are orange rather than red.
3.0,Sized way to small!! Looks good but person bought for can not use it
3.0,Returning it. It didn’t fit right.
3.0,Good quality shirt but the shirt run small for a size 7. I would recommend buying 1 size up because of how small it runs
3.0,I like the size of the shirt. Poor Quality and the size of the shorts doesn't match the size of the shirt. Shorts are 4 sizes to small.
3.0,A little stiff. Good for a special occasion but not for everyday wear.
3.0,"My 9 year old daughter loved the way this little owl watch looked online, and just had to have it.  It is a cute little owl that to open you only need to pinch the ears together, and the wings spread apart.  One side is a little stiff, but I thing a little oil and a break in period will correct that issue.<br /><br />the only issue that we have had with this watch, is the chain broke the first week she had it.  We replaced it with a higher quality necklace and all seems to be right in her world again..."
3.0,"I like the comfort of this bra with the thick shoulder straps. However, I do feel that the bra is a little confusing--it's a push up bra, and yet the cups are too full to show any cleavage whatsoever. I felt almost too covered by it because I like to show at least a little bit of cleavage. The bra is a beautiful green color and has lace details, yet with the way this bra fits it would not be one that I would want my boyfriend to see. Overall, this would be a bra I would recommend for someone who was focused solely on comfort and having full coverage.."
3.0,"I initially loved this product, and it looks just as promised. The beads, however, made the necklace drape down too far to where it was no longer a choker, and the strings were obnoxiously long and would tangle in my other necklaces."
3.0,Beautiful but cheaply made<br /> Don't stay in the that holds it very well. The necklace also breaks too easily.
3.0,"The product fits as expected, but it looks like it was used. Additionally, it had a very strange smell which I couldn't place. The color was fine and the product  kept my knees warm...but I wouldn't buy this again. Also noted that my package was opened upon delivery and I'm not sure why."
3.0,"I like the necklace but I found the earrings to be too big, heavy and clunky.  The necklace has a little weight but it helps it stay in place.  It is still a good deal for the price."
3.0,The glasses are great but the aren't very comfortable on the ears
3.0,"New out of the wrapper I found the material to be heavier then expected, probable better for further north than central Florida. An area was a bit lose, not defining the ab area. Overall, not bad!"
3.0,Runs very small. I have a small head and it barely covers nose and mouth.
3.0,"Super cute, but ultimately I got what I paid for and that was cheap but cute boots for wearing in the office."
3.0,This is too is a cute style but definitely fits a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"I purchased a 5-pair of these earrings for my bridesmaids, and was surprised to find one of the pairs came with two visibly different earrings.  They were both silver love knots, but one was much smaller than the other and had a different pattern on it.  The other 4 pairs were fine, but it was still a definite disappointment.  I gave 3 stars overall because Amazon was great to work with on the return process - I didn't have time to return all 5 pairs and get new ones, so Amazon refunded me the cost of a single pair, which I then used to purchase another single pair (which were a correct matching pair) - but the earrings themselves were a little larger than I expected.  Not huge, and not overly heavy...just bigger than I thought they'd be."
3.0,"I wish I had a picture to show.. but this just wasn’t great. The tail worked, kinda, so I wore it for my costume, but the ears were a little embarrassing to put on. They’re super tiny.. looked awkward on my big head."
3.0,Shorts fit a little loose and the heavily rely on the draw string. The phone pocket broke after one month of sparatic use.
3.0,"I have several stretch jersey dresses,  they are typically easy to wear and easy to dress up, great to pack and travel with. The weight of the material for these dresses could be heavier but in all the places you would want more coverage the fabric wraps over itself almost making it OK. However I feel like it settles on every bump, fold, elastic line, even with appropriate support garments. I'm 160 pounds, curvy bust and hip, 5'3&#34; and wear a size 8-10.  I think the way the shirrring is constructed at the sides along with the lighter weight fabric, brings the fabric into any small fold and rather then being flattering it accentuates absolutely every flaw. I have several other dresses in similar materials that are very slimming and very flattering coupled with a body briefer or carefully selected underwear, they present a nice finished appearance. Not these dresses.  So the finishing and stitching are adequate the design is nice with the Deep V neck and tulip hem, the length  is great and the two colors that I ordered,  one being black and one being a very light aqua are lovely and as pictured.  I intend to return them both based on the unflattering fit."
3.0,I ordered the red buffalo plaid (L) and it fit perfectly.  I decided to order the blue plaid (L) and it fits more like a Medium. Can't wear the blue one buttoned up
3.0,"It was cute pj. But I thought it was very thin material, especially the shirt. Also fit on the larger side especially around the neck portion of shirt."
3.0,Cute but faded a lot after one wash
3.0,"definitely a little small for my big chest, and i ordered a XL, i have DD's. but will fit nice under a tank top. i basically wanted it to use as a less ugly approach to a shirt that will see bra straps versus traditional bras. the caged straps are very nice. but the bra itself could use more material. especially for the larger sizes.. i would recommend getting this as a nice alternative to a nicer looking bra as an underneath item, but  thats about it."
3.0,"We just bought these and have used them twice. The second time in use, the snap broke!! We were just taking them off and it came apart."
3.0,"once its scratch its a staying for good. the shades it self was great but when i ordered a second one they gave me a slighly different one. One that does not look like whats on display on this page. Not so sure if i did something wrong, but over all its ok."
3.0,I've had this for a while and I was hoping it would wear out/stretch out. It didn't. I have this hat in the clownfish print and it's great. But this one is smaller and is uncomfortable.
3.0,Cute shoe but they really hurt your feet.
3.0,"Very wedding dress like, but the skirt was too see through"
3.0,"I got this dress as a beach coverup over my swimsuit, but it was too snug. I liked the light material and style. I’m 5’1”, 138lbs and wear between medium and large. This Large was more like a small- it fit my niece who wears a small."
3.0,"I believe it’s a quality jersey and seems to have the correct warmth and appears to be well made, But  the sizing is off, too small in the chest and tight in the arms. I sent it back and reordered the next size up."
3.0,"The only reason I'm giving a three stars is the dress came worn. It's stinks of perfume has a few stains, hopefully all will come out with a good wash. Otherwise I love the dress, that's the only reason I'm keeping it"
3.0,"I didn’t know it would have a white bottom. But that’s not my biggest issue. I was aware the purse would be small from reviews, BUT, I was unaware that the zipper and purse opening would be so small. I have to JAM my iPhone in there (it fits but hardly) best you’re getting is the phone, a lip gloss, and a debit card or two for the adult use. If you have a large smart phone or any iPhone plus model IT WILL NOT FIT. just a disclaimer. But the bag itself (although tiny) is super cute and well made. The strap feels sturdy and clips on easily. And it’s a really awesome bag to show off in all honesty. Great buy, just beware of size/PRACTICALITY"
3.0,Cute gift for my granddaughter but it broke within 2-3 weeks. Upset me and her!
3.0,I had to take them in because they were way too big. They fit great now. Very soft and I love the color.
3.0,The band is REALLY thin. Get 10 k for sure so it wears down slower.
3.0,"Cheap chain, but still a cute necklace"
3.0,"Love the color of denim and the floral embroidery, but they are too small in the waist for me."
3.0,Will not be returning these. Too big for me but a friend likes them so will give them to her.
3.0,It is really cute. But narrow at the bottom. I gave it to my friend and ahe loves it.
3.0,Well made. Looks great. BUT it is not HYPOALLERGENIC for me. Started itching within a day of having it on. I am going to find something coat it with so I can wear it.
3.0,Doesn’t hold scent very well. Nice quality bracelet though
3.0,"It just came today, seems like good quality.  I was severely disappointed to see that it does not have the patch.<br />Edit to add: Im not super happy with this backpack. There is a lot of space and pleanty of pockets, however, the backpack seems flimsy and the straps on the side will not stay laced so it will not hold anything to the side ofthe backpack."
3.0,"Great glasses, fit my face perfectly. They broke quite quickly though..."
3.0,When we went to universal studios Fl first day ripped by the time we got back all ripped and torn up
3.0,"The fit was fine on the bottom, but I don't know who they designed the top for. My breasts were squashed. The fit was simply terrible and I had to return the item.<br /><br />That said, it was well made and the return was simple."
3.0,Very pretty. Looks Bohemian paired with several other necklaces.
3.0,"I'm 5&#34;5 135lbs 36D chest - bought the medium.  The top wasn't big enough in the bra support for my boobs, the bottoms barely covered my crack!!!  Based on the other reviews I think the large would be too big.  returned.  Sad because it was cute."
3.0,"The bands at the top and bottom are pretty tight, which is good to keep a snug fit but can be annoying for long stretches."
3.0,"They seem like great sunglasses for a toddler anyway however my 2 year is a big kid with big head and these won’t stay on his head, intact they fit my adult head. They seem flimsy in the arms and easily stretch wider so they won’t stay on his head. They say toddler and reviews say fit as young as 18 months however mine don’t. Not sure if I got a bad batch or they are all like this. Now have to try and find another pair."
3.0,They work as far as sandles go. Kind of cheap but they serve their purpose.
3.0,"I loved this piece so much, and I know you get what you pay for. But after a couple of months of wearing it turned my skin green."
3.0,"Looked very night, however it broke after like 10 or so wears.<br />The little ball that is what holds it in the notches broke off and not the thing is useless to wear.<br />Past that the belt itself looked good, felt good and was slimming."
3.0,I didn't love the material or the fit. The waistband and wristbands were tight. I returned the item.
3.0,Works but for only a short period of time
3.0,"I only received 3 pairs, I understood I would be receiving 9 pairs.<br />They are very small but thick, making them difficult to clasp."
3.0,"Bought these for my teenager. They fit well, but within a few times wearing them, the snap ribbon on the side leg came unraveled from the pocket as it wasn't attached securely."
3.0,"Expected much better , but this also not so bad.. we can use, fitting is good"
3.0,"These are comfortable and well made garments, but even at XXL, they were too small for myself and my wife who are both over 6' tall.  We returned them."
3.0,"Pendant was true to size and quality, but not too impressed with discoloration of chain"
3.0,"I originally thought this was cute for my roomate who has a blck cat.  Seeing the price, I bought four thinking they would be great gifts for a few of my friends.  No one has worn the necklace yet.  I'm not hurt, nor can I blame them.  When is it appropriate to wear a black cat around your neck? I think only Friday the 13th."
3.0,"I didn’t care for these sunglasses. They were only 6$ which is why I bought them. But they didn’t sit right on my face...one side touched my eyebrow, and the other didn’t. They looked fine, just didn’t feel right. So if that doesn’t bother you, get them! The quality was great for the price."
3.0,"Very cute purse. This is able to hold all of my cards as well as dollar bills. The color was nice because it can go with anything.<br />Not the most flexible material, a little stiff if we’re being honest. And the back where the cards are held has a large gap when I snap it shut (as if it was to wrap and hold a phone too, but that didn’t work when I tried it. So it was an awkward gap).<br />The front compartment where a phone should fit did not hold my IPhone 8+. I actually got it stuck and had to force it out.<br />Overall, this is cute for someone who has a smaller phone and who wouldn’t mind the stiff, awkwardness of the bag."
3.0,"They are lightweight and are good for a couple wears. After that the metal hook starts to get oxidized & turns your ears green. If you need these for one night, they are great!"
3.0,It was 2 small 4 child not adult
3.0,Bought for my 3 yo. Slightly too large for her face. Packaging says 2-10. I do like that it comes with filters.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:3f06052ed8a31e84e6b3f409293103e2]] The fingers are abnormally long, if you can sew it’s an easy fix but if not don’t buy"
3.0,This product runs very small. It fits but is pretty tight. I think the next size up would have been better
3.0,It is bautifull but not big enoth strips is to low
3.0,"These are comfortable shorts but they run large.  The zipper is very cheap and won't hold up too long, just received them and zipper already doesn't want to zip correctly.  I would not buy again."
3.0,"In my opinion, I think they would be much prettier if they were smaller...they are almost gaudy"
3.0,"Not too good, but very nice"
3.0,"The upside is the pants will 'work with you' if you enjoy a snug fit, or if your weight fluctuates for whatever reason. But the feel is closer to polyester than denim. And for me, wearing pants in warm weather that don't 'breathe' adequately means more sweating and less comfort.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The look is ok and they'll definitely give here and there if need be. But I'd save them for cooler temps."
3.0,Fit smaller than expected. Nice material for staying dry.
3.0,"I usually love all my PattyBoutik purchases, but had to return this one.  It’s thick and the quality is good— but it was very large and the sleeves were way too long."
3.0,"Beautiful pieces of jewelry especially considering the price.  I've received compliments every time I wear it!<br /><br />Unfortunately it fell apart after wearing maybe 5 times. I'm very disappointed, as it is beautiful piece"
3.0,"The small shirt is very long.  The papa and mama shirts are fine,"
3.0,These fall off way too quickly.
3.0,It's nice material and fits snug to the face but the filters it comes with are difficult to keep in the pouch ..<br /><br />Unless they figure out a way to keep the filters from constantly shifting and twisting in the pouch I wouldn't recommend this product unless you're willing to use it without the filter in the pouch ..
3.0,"Ken could not get his hands in them because they were too small.  He had to cut them off to fit because he was using them to bath and wash his face with.  They fit me fine.  I was happy with the price so it did not bother me when he came in and showed me he had taken scissors to his pair.  Glad I bought two pairs. The only reason three stars is because of the size for Ken, but 10 stars for the price."
3.0,It is cute. I just tought that the heart shape would be better. But I still like them anyway :)
3.0,I needed to replace my salon color robes.  These are nice but I do wish they were a little thicker.  The material is really thin and I don’t know if they will last after numerous washes.  We will see.  Great product for the cost.
3.0,The fit is nice but the material is thinner than expected.
3.0,Fabric is a little cheap. Lint magnet.
3.0,"Super cute dress, a great alternative for dressing up in costume. Love the A-Line, flattering for almost anyone. However, it is a bit see through.  You have to wear a cami or sports bra with it."
3.0,"I got the 2 black and 1 pink 3 pack. They fit a little small, and the pink shirt is a different material than the black ones. On The black ones, the material is so thin that the first time I was putting it on my toddler, my finger went right through the shirt and ripped a hole. The pink shirt is nice though"
3.0,"The mechanism to tighten the band doesn't stay snug, so I keep having to readjust & tighten my watch throughout the day."
3.0,"On surface and from outside this does appear to be a good and a likeable purse.  The metallic strap is of good length and decent quality.  The satin fabric that has been used to make this purse also appears quite good. The grey silverish sheen on this purse actually makes it look very good and it does seem quite versatile which can go with any dress.<br /><br />Overall, this purse looks wise is quite good.  The issue comes in with what is inside.  As you can see in the pictures, the edge of the purse is bent inwards and that creates a bit of dent. So if you don't have a lot of stuff in the purse, it will give that hollow feeling with the inwardly bent edge.  Due to this, the closure flap at times works and at times doesn't work too.  The closing mechanism is magnet based but it doesn't always align due to this edge being bent.  So that's where this product falls flat."
3.0,"I like the color and the inside of the bag,  just wish it was a little bigger, wanted it for traveling, so now using it as an every day bag"
3.0,I got a large. It didn't look right on me.
3.0,Way too long. I looked like I was wearing a dress.
3.0,No es buena calidad ! Lo mullido 👎🏻
3.0,Like Halloween costume material. No pockets.
3.0,Very cute boots.. fit a little tight. Might wanna order a size bigger or if you like an 8 order and 81/2. The studs are already getting dents and bent up a little... not to bad though. I like them :)
3.0,"I want to give this watch two stars but I will give it three to be nice. The watch is okay. It doesn't look as brilliant as it looks online. The gold color is weak (like 12 karat gold color) and the leather band is tacky looking. The band was also small for my hand. I am 6' 2&#34; and it barely wraps around my wrist (last notch). I never had issues like that with a watch before but then I realized that they are marketing this watch for men and women so they are trying to get the size in the middle for both. The strap is too thin and feminine to me. I also bought this watch on the manufacturer's site for $79 so it's always good to see it selling $10 cheaper on amazon right after you buy it. In short the watch is okay. It's better on women I think or it can be for -as Arnold likes to say- girly men. Personally, I will use it for work for like a year then give it away."
3.0,"While the size and design are just what I wanted the earring post is very thin and bends easily, even during the process of inserting them in  your ears.  Don't think it will take long for the post to break off."
3.0,"Really nice dress.  I purchased a few in different colors.  They stain really easy and the stain doesn't come out no matter what I have use, except clorox."
3.0,It looks really cheap like a vinyl iron on And the extra large fit to small
3.0,"It's ok but I did want this to look like the photo- it's very light grey white and pinkish red, I got the one with the strap tank not the thicker thing if that helps anyone. It's slick poly material and it fits well so I am going to keep it but it's not what the picture shows."
3.0,"A birthday present for my granddaughter, she loves it."
3.0,Its cute but you can't wear it with closed toe shoes. 1 month in and one of the stones fell out. Bummer!
3.0,"Perfect style that was desired and need, but was a little big for a kid"
3.0,Material was not cute
3.0,"My dress arrived today... Very fast shipping! The dress fit perfectly and I really like the design, however, I do not like the way the dress feels. The fabric is too thick although, I like the amount of stretch.  The dress felt too heavy when I tried it on too! It felt like I was wearing a 50's costume! I am returning the dress ASAP!"
3.0,"As pictured, length okay, but material is much heavier than the full length I purchased a week ago and the same capris I purchased a few months ago. I like the higher waistline and pocket on 90 Degree, but  the materials when buying the same exact item is not consistent. Not so much a fan of the heavier ones as they take longer to dry and weigh more to pack for backpacking."
3.0,"liked the packaging,  the case,  the cleaning towel,  the color,  etc.  The shape was just not how I would normally expect this style .  Too much room on the bottom side,  about a fingers worth."
3.0,"I recently received this item from China.  The item is as pictured except for one thing.  The wings do not lay flat like I assumed. The pin runs vertically on the back of one of the wings.  So with every movement the pin rocks which is not something you want with such a large pin.  I carefully stuffed material on the back side of the pin to keep it stabilized.  However, this didn't solve the problem concerning the way the wings are displayed as a two dimension effect.<br /><br />It's kind of hard to explain.  But the weight of the pin isn't so heavy that the pin pulls forward from the material it's pinned against.  But because the wings do not lay flat, it's as if it had.  Essentially this is not the best designed pin to have in your collection.  The wings are a great distance from whatever they are pinned to.  I haven't measured but it could be as much as 1/2&#34;."
3.0,Thought it looked like an old ladies dress. 😐
3.0,"I mean, there were a couple of dollars so, you get what you pay for."
3.0,neat socks but too small for my 8yr old nephew
3.0,"Order 2-3 sizes up! Adorable shirt, great quality, thick stretchy material, but a large was the size of a juniors small or medium. I know this because I have a 13 yes old and it doesn’t fit her. It’s tiny. I ordered up (usually a M) because of the reviews."
3.0,This necklace is very odd to put on and constantly gets tangled.
3.0,"Took 29 days to arrive.  Not as big as I had expected and looked kind of flimsy.  Other than that, I like the design and color scheme."
3.0,"Pros:<br />Feels soft and good on touch<br />Appears to be well made<br />Cons:<br />Seriously smaller than the one in the pictures<br />Not a slouch, just a beanie"
3.0,Love the dress but was too long and material itched. Material was also heavy
3.0,The glasses are sharp looking but do not fit snug over my glasses to stop wind from coming in sides etc. So good for car travel not outdoors. The ear arms are also very sharp (pointed). Could be a hazard if not careful. Not impressed with the fit. These may go back. I bought them because I am having cataract surgery and wanted stylish polarized sunglasses.
3.0,It's really cute it is a little snug and no room for error so if you are not sure order a size larger
3.0,I like the dress besides being to large in the bust and some stiching overlapped on the dress.
3.0,A great look! Easy to put on my wrist but not that great in durability. The pin that holds the buckle in place fell out somewhere at work. Never found it!
3.0,"Nice looking sneaker, and the reflective piping increases visibility. Very cool looking at night!<br /><br />I'm not sure how long these will last, but wanted to leave a review to let others know that these run quite small. I usually buy size 11(in a wide if possible). If a wide isn't available, I'll buy a 11.5. These 11.5's run quite narrow, and feel smaller than an 11.<br /><br />Definitely buy a size up."
3.0,The pants became baggy and wrinkled as the day went on. The ladder at the side of the leg was elastic  and cheap looking.
3.0,Flimsy made but do the job of blocking sun<br />  Just have to handle delicately
3.0,Fits tight.
3.0,"I really like the quality, materials and overall construction of these boots...  BUT they are very narrow, like fancy dress shoe narrow.  I wear a 10.5. my wife wears a 7 and ,,my size 10 shoes were too narrow for her size 7 feet.  Now I admot that I prefer wide shows but these seem especially narrow warranting this extra note...  I think these are still an ok buy, especially if you have narrow feet so I am giving them a 3 star buy rating...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
3.0,"Three stars because I LOVE the way that these yoga pants feel and look, minus two because forget doing any downward dogs; really see-through. I am going to try going a size up and see if that helps, because I want to be able to wear these so bad : ("
3.0,3 months before all but one stone fell out. Bummed because of the price and only 3 months of use
3.0,Excellent product but the small size is to large
3.0,Not really long enough
3.0,"Not too black the lens, but beautiful shape and oversized, the only issue is the transparency of lens"
3.0,Touch screen doesn't work at all. They get wet easily and cold when they're wet. But they do stay pretty warm when dry.
3.0,It's an okay shirt. Bigger than expected and the top didn't lay flat
3.0,"wrong band, my bad"
3.0,Oof
3.0,It was not flattering.
3.0,I really wanted this to work but it came with a broken main compartment zipper. I liked the bag otherwise and was looking forward to my first sling bag.
3.0,"I couldn't wait to receive my new sandals, but unfortunately they do not fit properly. The foot portion fits well, they are wide as stated. The calf area, however, is extremely large. Much larger than I understood from the wide calf in the description (most imported items run smaller) They are well made and cute, i wish i could wear them! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"If you plan to use this shirt for layering, error towards a size smaller. She new this shirt tends to shed."
3.0,Cute but did not fit as expected.
3.0,Some earrings would be nice it's hard to find se to  match up. Also was delivered broke
3.0,"Product looks just like I thought it would from information provided on Amazon page.  Quality overall is good.  However, The one buckle on the handle keeps coming undone.  I had to sew the strap to itself in order to keep it from coming undone.  Not too happy about that.  Otherwise, happy with it."
3.0,"Having purchased this type of product in the past I knew they tend to run small.  I wear a size 5 in regular underwear, but purchased a large in these disposables.  Good thing I did as the fit while a tiny bit big would was the size I needed.  Quality is good."
3.0,Tight around my arms and neck and I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear
3.0,"It’s thinner than expected, making it see through."
3.0,It does help a bit with night driving but i don't notice any degree of polarization as advertised. Kinda big on the temple side.
3.0,"This review is for I&S Men's 12 Pack Low Cut No Show Ankle Socks - Size 10-13.<br /><br />The value for these socks is great but I found them pretty thin and I wouldn't really call them low cut, I'd call them normal cut. These are good for summer months and shoes that might be a bit snug, but I wouldn't use them when going to the gym as they wouldn't be very absorbent. My husband either requires socks for dress shoes or more absorbent socks for anytime he's wearing sneakers. That said like I mentioned the value is really good for 12 and it's always good to have extra socks!<br /><br />Disclaimer: Please note that I received this 12 pack of low cut no show ankle socks at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Opinions are entirely my own and I do not guarantee five stars. I depend on reviews and know others do too. I hope this review is helpful for you."
3.0,Great fit!! More of a red color than maroon as pictured. Mine were bright red but I wanted maroon/burgundy. True to size!!
3.0,Chest area is too small given the looseness of the rest of the dress. Fabric is pretty and would be a great summer dress but unfortunately flattens my entire chest.
3.0,the material is itchy.  I sent it back
3.0,"Pretty bands. Easy to install, brilliant colors and loved the look of them. I really wanted them to work for me. Eventhough I ordered the small. They were too big on my wrist. The buckle ended up in an odd spot. One notch...the last notch was too tight the the next one up was too loose. I had to reluctantly send them back."
3.0,This is a birthday gift for my granddaughter<br />Not sure yet
3.0,"I could not get this over my head. I usually wear an xxl in all dresses, I am a pin up model searching for the right clothing for upcoming events, and this will not even go over my head with my arms. So disappointed!"
3.0,"The beak is crooked & filled in so it doesn’t fit over my nose. The eyes are close together & slanted, so it’s hard to see out of since they don’t line up will with normal features. Must trim the feathers on the bottom since they go up your nostrils when breathing in. It arrived 3 days late, but in time for the party I plan to wear it to. Overall it’s cute & would cost more than the price to DIY it. I wish it were a little more “functional”."
3.0,The thongs fit ok. The first ones I order according to the chart and were wayyy too big. The 2nd ones I ordered were perfect fit but the pouch is very small. Too tight for comfort and I'm not larger in the package area.<br /><br />The material is very soft though
3.0,"They LOOK great! Fit nice, but the stitching was very poor, so I returned them."
3.0,"The model for this suit does a beautiful job making it gorgeous but not so much on me.  The extra material in front is too big and feels like wings getting in my way.  Would be more flattering I think if they weren't so prominent. I love the pattern and the material is great.  One of those, almost but not quite kind of purchases."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ab86cf624bf693535a96fee33e3db5e9]] Great product, nothing to complain quality-wise. However, it's too darn large even the smallest size which I ordered. Still very baggy, tons of material not filled. I'm a short but bulky guy. Helikon-Tex is a great company though."
3.0,Pretty pattern but very thin cheap material. Not very flattering over bumps. I am 5'5&#34; and 160 lbs ordered a Large a little snug. If I was taller than 5'5&#34; this dress would be too short.  Not worth the amount I paid.<br />Updated review.<br />Since posting this review my Google gmail has been hacked🤔
3.0,They are nice sunglasses although are a little wide so slide off my head pretty easily.
3.0,"I like the stretchy material,  the fit and the style."
3.0,"The hat itself is black, but the logo background is Navy Blue NOT black like the photograph."
3.0,Camo Tactical Tube Urban Digital Camouflage Bandana Military Multifunction Face Mask Ski Balaclava Snowboard Moto X Face Protection Harley Davidson Snowboard Ski Mask Multi Function Tactical Seamless - Very thin and poorly made. As others have said very thin and not effective. Better than nothing but not what I was expecting at all. Cut from a tube of material and not finished on either end for it frays apart.
3.0,Good quality.  Size just runs too large.
3.0,Cute but needed adjustments because it was so small.
3.0,"They are ok. Nothing too fancy. Interesting fit as well. Have yet to rock them with an outfit, but once summer ends, I can see these being fall staples."
3.0,Did not care to the fit on my body. The pockets were in a weird location that made my hips look super awkward.
3.0,"They feel fragile, and are quite small. I'm not disappointed in them for the price, but I feel like they could break easily."
3.0,This shoe is very tough and should be strong enough for the outdoor adventure but compared to those branded hiking boots there are two main problems with it.<br />1. the size comes a little small. i used to wear 11 but this 11 i bought is too small for me.<br />2. The insole is very thin so you will feel pretty stiff when you wear it and the geometry does not provide too much support for the feet. So it makes me uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,It is more of a summer night robe than a winter. Great for summer or warm places.
3.0,"They're really cute, but after a few washes seem really small and barely come past my ankle now."
3.0,This was ok. It was smaller than expected and the fur was very matted.
3.0,Great back up shoe but wears out quickly if work as main shoe.
3.0,Too large wanted a slim one. I've used it my error.
3.0,"I expected it to be a stiffer material, almost like a suit jacket. It's a nice material, but it's too flowy and not acceptable for the event I am attending. I'll still wear it otherwise."
3.0,"I like the design of the sunglasses but there is a major flaw, glare on the inside of the lenses. If the sun or lights are behind you or off the the side, you will get an almost blinding glare."
3.0,"Cap is made in nice Camogrom camouflage (plays well with MultiCam type camo) from the same &quot;shark skin&quot; material as the [[ASIN:B004L4HU04 Helikon Gunfighter Soft Shell Jacket]].  This material has an inner layer of fleece on one side and an outer layer of rubbery material that is highly water resistant.  I like Helikon's &quot;shark skin&quot; material better than Mil-Tec's and Tru-Spec's versions, which don't feel as nice and are not as comfortable to wear as Helikon's.  So this cap is useful for when it's cold and wet out, but it will eventually soak through because the material is also slightly air-permeable.  It has coyote colored interior, under-bill and patches, four hook-and-loop velcro panels in different sizes on the front (approximately 2&quot; H x 3.5&quot; W), top (1.5&quot; x 1.5&quot;), rear top (1.5&quot; x 2&quot;), rear bottom (1&quot; x 3&quot;).  The hook-and-loop strap on the back can accommodate my big (size &gt; 7 3/4) head, which is always a worry for me when faced with a &quot;one size fits all&quot; cap, but the cap rides high and often works its way loose, so I took off two stars.  But the fit and finish is excellent with no loose threads, no crooked or bad stitches (all the velcro panels are properly and symmetrically placed), and no obnoxious labels just a small Helikon label stating how to care for the cap (machine wash but no dryer), what it's made of (polyester), and where it's made (China -- not Poland as some have thought).  Recommended for heads sized 7 3/4 or less.  Material and camouflage matches the [[ASIN:B00GYV2G6U Helikon Gunfighter Soft Shell Jacket Camogrom]], which I like better than Helikon's MP camouflage."
3.0,This is the photo you requested.one came with out the hook.
3.0,I returned this bag. It is makes a lot of noise when you carry it. To much clanging for me.
3.0,"Came in a generic box without the Nana dedication, which is why I bought it. Disappointing"
3.0,The material feels really cheap the one I ordered was supposed to be black and I got a dark gray
3.0,"If you're looking for a shooting glove, this is not it. My hands are already big so with pistols this is a no go. Ar's are Ok. As a work glove yes. But I recommend looking at something besides these gloves. I use 2 different pairs. Oakley and mechanix gloves."
3.0,"I specifically ordered these because I was searching for something seamless. I get that they have a seam, because search results aren't always accurate. But I wear them to sleep and even then they cut into my toes. They are otherwise soft and nice and I like the anti-skid bottoms."
3.0,I don't know why the small amount of spandex in the jeans can make them &#34;grow&#34; on you so much!  This morning it fit perfectly but by afternoon I had to be hauling them up!  I suppose the best thing would be to buy two sizes smaller so that by the time they start stretching they will be the right size.
3.0,I have been looking for the style for a very long time and did look at the size but didn’t really pull out my ruler. They are so so so so tiny. Do your homework before ordering
3.0,"I got the &#34;chloe ivory&#34; colorful shirt. The texture of the main fabric was not very soft, was think, and sort of crinkly... it just wasn't what I was expecting. I returned it."
3.0,I am 5'2 and about 130 lbs. The small fit me well but was too short for my taste. Also I wasn't as crazy about the all lace back as I thought I'd be.
3.0,Just an average umbrella
3.0,For my Great Granddaughter who is a tiny 10 month old.  It would fit a 6 mo old.<br />Disappointed
3.0,"These are Asian sizing. A size 3xl doesn’t fit and that’s normally a comfortable size for me. Graphics are cool, feel is ok, but delicate."
3.0,It seems to be a little tight.  I ordered a size bigger than normal.
3.0,"This is a fine, Chinese made watch, with Miyota movement. No made in Russia imprint. A bit overpriced."
3.0,"Not durable but pretty and different, can be used as sleepers also"
3.0,"These are beautiful,  but very heavy"
3.0,They are pretty but it’s different than the picture
3.0,"It’s a beautiful color pink and I like the length. However, that is about the only good I can find.  It’s a VERY thin jacket and it’s NOT waterproof in any way.  It would be a push to even call it water resistant. Too think for rain or cold weather protection.  It is a cute jacket.  I had one snap in the arm sleeve that won’t snap. Very disappointed for the price."
3.0,"These are nice, fashionable sunnies that are great for everyday use.  I have a low bridge nose and these are a little too high for that kind of nose, but they are still nice over all. I feel very stylish in these days. I recommend them to anyone looking for decent, fashionable glasses without wanting to break the bank."
3.0,"These look very cute in the picture but I will tell you they are very cheaply made. They come in a plastic bag, not in a box so when you get them they are all creased up and folded and soft. I can tell the first time they get wet the water is going to go all the way through. These are only to be worn in dry weather, they are also very thin. I am not very happy with my purchase at all."
3.0,"Absolutely not true to size. Made of cheap metal, way overpriced for what it is."
3.0,Smaller than I thought it barely crosses over in the front for me. Its also pretty short and gets static clingy very quickly. I honestly would spend more money on a good cotton or bamboo robe over this one again.
3.0,"I really love these shirts but the largest they come are 14-16 and they are definitely not that size. They are much smaller. Unfortunately, I must return them."
3.0,"It's not bad for the price. Already a little thread wear after one washing, but not too bad for a cheap robe."
3.0,"what is there to love with this? I dont know, couldn't even get it on to try it, big bulky. Just returned it,"
3.0,"Cheaper material than i expected. Also shorter..comes couple inches above knee...rides up when i move. I love the pattern, so I’m keeping it. Just wish it was longer like picture and better material. Advise getting fewer sizes larger if you want it to fit better."
3.0,"I would would actually give this about a 3.5 star rating. Now don't get me wrong, I do love them but I have a couple of complaints.<br />#1- I didn't realize that the connection pieces was literally doing to be like a nail. If I had known that I probably wouldn't have bought them because after a day it makes my poor ears itch and ache.<br />#2- the wood itself feels pretty cheap. I was expecting more of an actual wood but this stuff feels like the cheap, fake wood.<br />#3- I'm a little concerned about the quality of them over an extended period of time. When you put them on, it's essentially just putting a nail into a precut home and I'm wondering how long it will hold over time.<br /><br />The design is still awesome and they look great. I was just expecting more."
3.0,My husband used this ring to propose to me but ordered it under someone elses name so i wouldnt know...the stone fell out twice and now its just an empty ring my heart was so broken because i loved my engagement ring.
3.0,"It fit as expected. Not ax cute on, but too late to return."
3.0,I usually order a medium but decided to go with a large this time just in case. When I tried it on I was hoping it was going to be a little loose but instead I struggled to take it off for a minute. I'm getting another one hoping the X-Large will be a little loose. I would recommend ordering a size or two up. Definitely ment for people that are smaller...
3.0,This skirt is cute. I bought the burgandy one for a party. The only problem is that it's somewhat sheer.
3.0,They didn't last long. great sizes. but started to chip and fade pretty quick. had sharp edges I had to file down just to be able to wear it.
3.0,Cute outfits good quality for the price newborn onesie fits like a 12 month and newborn pants are more like 9months.
3.0,Nice thickness but I feel runs just a bit small. Color is what I expected. Warm.
3.0,My son liked them.of course they look fake but they are the cutest for kids who are pretending like my 9yr. old
3.0,"They are a little hard to put on at first but once they get on, they feel okay.  They are perfect for the new coat I bought. And I am a  huge University of Alabama fan so I love them."
3.0,"This is a nice, solid, well made ring, but.... The WOW factor is not there! The metal and the cz's look the same so it looks like just a metal band. There is no sparkle from the stones unless you look close and they are smaller than what I thought they would be. The ring itself, like I mentioned before, is solid and very comfortable to wear and I'm sure will last. But if you are looking for sparkle, pizzazz, and WOW, this ring won't do it for you."
3.0,"I ordered from the chart.  XL = 16/18.  The tag on the suit said lg/xl.  It's a bit snug, but wearable.  Won't purchase from that seller again.  Also, took 2wks. to get it."
3.0,"If you have big boobs they will spill out on the sides . Bottoms fit great tho. Also, the sting that wraps around your neck isn’t padded so it will hurt"
3.0,"I like this choker... is simple, just how I wanted it. I just dont think I'd be willing to pay $10 for it. I'd be willing to pay at most $5 for it.<br />For this price, you'd expect the golden part of it to be more &#34;heavy-duty&#34; but instead it looks rather cheap.<br />Dont get me wrong, it is cute... just not for the price.<br />I will update on the quality, I could be wrong.<br />Edit:<br />Originally gave it 4 stars, but the velvet is not longer attached from the golden piece... cheap"
3.0,"I mght have been paying attention to the details, but this is very small.  It's cute and ended up working for my nephew  because he was only a year old when we were trying to dress him up as the White Rabbit, but I was surprised at how tiny this is."
3.0,The top half of the ghee is great but the bottom half is way too wide and big almost unusable. I don't know what I expected for so little money. I got one of the smallest ones in the waist was like a 40.
3.0,This sweater is a little brown and not a rich deep brown that I was looking for. Nevertheless sweater fits as expected.
3.0,"It didn't last 2 full months before chain broke, with intermittent wear."
3.0,It's pretty but a way to big
3.0,tupac would be proud
3.0,"Poor quality what you get for the price. Instead of returning, my kitty is wearing it and looks cute on him. Fits perfectly so not tight at all. Changed 2 stars to 3."
3.0,Had to sew a hole in the waist seam.  Dress ok.  Not a fan of the fabric.  Dress cheaply made.  Will not order another.
3.0,"Well, pretty dress but definitely made for someone who is shorter. The waist came up way too high and it was extremely short. I’m 5’8 and 210 lbs. The extra large was the right size for me but, more meant for someone under 5’6”. Had to return."
3.0,It’s a little long and when I was outside I felt like I was wearing a slip bc it looked satin to me. Fits high waisted which I like and was not tight at waist.
3.0,"It’s cute and hopefully it will last a while. It was on sale so I guess the price was reasonable. If I had paid more, I’d be disappointed. It is very very thin and flimsy. Also, I didn’t realize it was made in China."
3.0,"Love this watch, and lots of other people find it intriguing. Unfortunately, the second hand fell off. I bought in September, so had it only six months or so. It shouldn't fall off no matter what, but I actually have been very careful with it AND don't wear it (or any watch) very often. I'd give a normal, defective watch one star, but I actually like this watch so much that 1) I'm willing to wait right now on the phone to file a warranty claim, and 2) am willing to still give it 3 stars. Feels very light, and the strap is very comfortable."
3.0,"This seller provides wrong information for the product, misleading customers to purchase. The material is not cotton. Not comfortable. Refund never back to my credit card from June 16, 2022 issued.<br />It’s very bad experience."
3.0,"The picture doesn't show its an oversized sweater. I ordered a medium and it fit like a 1x. With that said, it is really pretty and kind of a cottony sweater. Returning it was very easy"
3.0,Pretty and I can wear them for a short bit but the front piece must not be stainless or surgical steal bc my ears rashed out due to a reaction. I can’t wear fake Jewelry.
3.0,"The suit fit well (size 16), but the scoop back just doesn't give enough support for large breasts. I wish this went straight around the back like the miraclesuit swim dress and the tankini I have."
3.0,Purchased for wife - has objectionable odor upon  opening but has subsided with time.
3.0,The color is not as vibrant as the picture shows disappointed
3.0,Fix was a little tight but washed well.
3.0,This is fine for laps at home which is why I wanted it.  Cups aren’t great quality better without them.
3.0,"Soft. Not dry fit material feel. I got a white in size medium and it is see through. It gives me a loose fit having a 27"" waist and 37"" hips. It doesn not hug around the hips. The fit is like the picture they advertised but 3 stars for it being pretty see through. The length is what I like which covers the crotch area, so its good for leggings."
3.0,"The watch itself is nice, but the band breaks too easily"
3.0,"The bottom of the feathers spreads out over time, they end up looking like big triangles. But you get what you pay for I suppose."
3.0,"Other than a ""creak"" in one of the heels, the shoe is very cute and fits well"
3.0,Ordered the 3 pack bears print and expected 100% cotton as in the product description. Disappointed that they’re cotton/spandex blend. They’re soft and stretchy and we shall see how they handle laundering and whether they shrink.
3.0,looks a little cheap from up close. Strong blue looks great from far away and on pictures
3.0,They are short
3.0,Plastic pockets and tab not as thick as the original Rolf's and probably won't last as long. Windows a little snub for two credit cards.
3.0,I returned this because it was too see through.
3.0,"I wear size 18 jeans, these were big at first but after washing they shrunk and fit well. They don’t stay up as well as I would like them too but I wasn’t surprised because most pants this style don’t anyway on me"
3.0,"Nice quality, however, white is more of a ecru or off white color"
3.0,"I am 5'4 & 130lbs, 34D bra size. I ordered a large suit & it fits ok. It deff runs small I am glad I ordered a large I am usually a medium. Overall ok suit. I suggest ordering up one size"
3.0,This blouse was not the same as the picture.
3.0,This is a super wrinkly shirt.  I actually purchased it to match a pair of work out pants I have so it's ok but I would hate to have to iron it all the time if I wore it out of the house.
3.0,Goggles are great! Cool carrying case. The swim cap tore first use. Never even got to try it. Seller was responsive and gave money back. Overall happy with purchases.
3.0,"I like the style, but unfortunately it was to large and the right shoulder strap was sewn on twisted. I returned it."
3.0,"This is not the first time I bought a Fox ranger short. Now I believe quality was a under my expectations, no zippier pocket and after a first wash it looks like if I had it from months age."
3.0,Knee parts are not extra padded.  They're more like socks.
3.0,"Lovely leather bag BUT MUCH SMALLER THAN ANTICIPATED.  Even after reading the reviews that the bag is small, it still wasn't the size I was expecting.  Also...it's decent quality but not top of the line. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3.0,This purse did not work for me. Fast delivery.
3.0,It’s a cute dress. It runs a little smaller than the seller says. I’m a 2x in everything and ordered the 3x because amazon clothes tend to run small. This fit perfectly. The seller says it fits like a 22 but it’s more like an 18. But it’s really see through. You need a slip or something underneath to not see your undergarments.  I held the dress up in front of my face and could still see through both the front and the back of the dress.  Got to return it .
3.0,"Beautiful. Slightly sheer. RED NOT BURGUNDY. No tags - what?! Definitely cheap, and I probably wouldn’t buy again. Be aware empire waist makes just about everyone look fluffier than they are. (I’m 5’5’, 170lbs but pretty active.) I blurt an XL and could have sized down. But I did feel fun and flirty and got several compliments."
3.0,"Like the dress but the top part is very thin and see through , at least in the light pink version. I’m sure a darker color would have been fine but the light pink didn’t work without an undershirt of some kind."
3.0,Cute style but I don't care for the material - too flimsy.
3.0,Lenses got lines in them after a few weeks of light wearing. Not scratches but some kind of failure inside the lense
3.0,"I like the idea of this shirt. The font is cute and the “bleach splotch” look is nice. But the material on this shirt is awful. I can’t stand the thin stretchy spandex material and this shirt does just that. It isn’t flattering though in the image it looks like a baggy t shirt material, it isn’t. It is clingy and stretchy."
3.0,real thin
3.0,runs smaller than your regular size.  Love the suit though.
3.0,"The first time out I got lots of compliments, I wore it all day in high heat so it needed a wash. I hung it in the closet and when I put it on next it had lines all over the front of it. Weird lines that I cant explain outside of I washed it and it didn't hold up well."
3.0,Shipping was faster then expected but the size of the bags weren’t large. I still plan to use them but they won’t be good for large grocery trips. Just good for going to the store grabbing small light items.
3.0,"I don't love how the sleeves look.  Other than that, it's okay.  I will wear it around the pool at home but had originally purchased for a trip.  Couldn't bring myself to wear it on the trip."
3.0,I expected the fabric to be a heavier weight but the product will serve the purpose just fine.
3.0,"Cutest shoes ever,tons of complements but the sole ripped right off and had to get them fixed right away"
3.0,"I was REALLY hoping this dress would fit me and be flattering but it was not. I am a 38DDD and the chest area was tight. I could of sized up to see if it fit better but I ordered 3 more dresses along with this one and decided to go with another. The color is true, pretty teal. The torso area is like a tube top material. Straps are adjustable, I would try this dress again in the future, just didn't work out for right now."
3.0,The first blouse was too small.  I am a small but had to get an xtra large.  The blouse that came was not stitched on the sleeve.  I'm going to have to do a repair before I can wear it.
3.0,"Bigger stones than expected.  So gave to my sister, who loves bigger size jewelry than I do."
3.0,"I bought this to use with my Apple watch that is rose gold.  I won't be using the cover for the watch face.  It's made of cheap plastic.  I double I'll use the band, but may try it with my rose gold to see if it's OK."
3.0,"Where the heel meets the rest of the shoe, it’s already breaking. This is very disappointing. I really liked these boots but they didn’t last very long."
3.0,Doubt let your husband wash them... they turn into belly shirts.  The material isn't the highest quality-like cheap jersey material with a rolled hem. Very drapey & best layered.
3.0,Love the color; material is a little thick for summer (best for winter). Should be listed as a Mini type dress... or just  a Tunic.
3.0,"I’m still happy with the jacket, it’s good for fall and the color, although not as saturated, is pretty. The length is like the photo."
3.0,"These are a great pair of workout shorts.  They are light, breathable, and they look good as well.  They have a mesh interior for extra support.<br /><br />My biggest complaint was that the size was totally off.  You have to look closely at the description and the label, an XL pair of shorts is actually a M.  This is really annoying because I really like the shorts, and they would be great for working out.  They are moisture wicking and lightweight and a perfect length for running."
3.0,"Pattern and color very nice. Nice style. Runs big across chest for me. Bought X-Large , I'm usually large, based on reviews due to larger chest area and it's very baggy. Material is a type of nylon and see through so will need a slip or shorts underneath."
3.0,"I love the style, fit and feel of this shirt, but it snags so so easily 🙁"
3.0,Cheap but i was sorda expecting that
3.0,"Fits as expected and is comfortable enough.  I was hoping to use this for jogging but feel like they don't hold me well enough (ie: bouncing occurs), which makes it quite uncomfortable to run in.<br /><br />I would absolutely use this for a lower impact sport though (weights / yoga / etc), but not good for running, sorry."
3.0,"I got this for Halloween.  I had to look up what it actually comes with since the description on here doesn't really specify.  It's the skirt and head piece.  I added some more feathers to the headpiece because it seemed too plain without more.  The tutu is fine, but I think I could make one of my own.  I already had my feather piece for the back and I just needed more ""peacock"" added to me.  So, it was okay, I got it last minute because I couldn't make something in time."
3.0,"~The product is well made. I really like it, the only issue is the 3 WHITE bottoms in your intimate area. So werid!"
3.0,Top ok tulle No disgusting it looks like a toddler took some scissors to the skirt
3.0,It was my own fault that I did not see in the description that the sizes were china sizes and that I should probably order a couple sizes larger than what I needed in order for it to fit. I bought based off the size chart which is based on American size.Also it took a really long time to get here. And the jacket is a lot thinner than what I was looking for. I probably could have worn a 4x ( normally I’m 2x) but they don’t go that hi
3.0,"I ordered this for an elderly aunt. She needed a snap front, due to her age and arthritis. Upon receiving this, I opened the top of the package to discover it had buttons, not snaps. This ad was misleading. I sent it back.😔"
3.0,Dress has an odd fit. I ordered a small (5’2 135 lbs) and it was lose and tight in all of the wrong places.
3.0,These boxers run small. If you are goign to purchase go up one size.
3.0,"Ordered a large and it fit like an extra small, gave it to my daughter in law. Won't do it again."
3.0,Buy a size larger to ensure comfort.
3.0,Really cute...but being a 12-14 the large was too small.  Gave it to my daughter who is a size 10 and it fit her perfectly.
3.0,Arrived on time. But not size I wanted.
3.0,Ordered and XL becuase it is form fitting but even still you can see EVERY thing (good and bad). Super cute but I was self conscious when I wore it...
3.0,Buy a size bigger if you are looking for a relaxed fit because I got t the size I normally wear and it is skin tight
3.0,The color the comfort
3.0,"In Short, bad chain, great charm, but keep in mind you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Got it as a gift for my girlfriend overseas. She absolutely loves it and wears it every day. The chain she found tore into her neck and wore through the thin silver coating on them, turning her neck a bit green and the chain a copper color. The cat has been fairing a little better, but still is showing a similar color now. She is going to try cleaning it with some silver polish to bring it back. The chain was not savable, so I had to buy a new one."
3.0,It's an ok dress. The material is kinda thin and scratchy. It is a pretty color and gives a n8ce shape.
3.0,Beautiful but broke in pieces after 2 days
3.0,I liked this dress. The quality was not all that great but i would not call it poor either. I returned it.
3.0,"The gift box was torn, broken at the edge, and the gold foil was coming off the logo at the top. The socks were nice, but hard to give this as a gift with a terrible box."
3.0,I am a very petite lady and I purchased this dress in an small and it was to big but the color was great and it looked nice on me. Great buy still!
3.0,The needle comes loose on one spot!
3.0,Got these as a last minute party favor for my wife who was having a Twilight party.  The ladies all loved them - took pictures with them etc.  Well worth the small $'s paid for them
3.0,"These socks are what I was looking for; however, they are too big for my small feet."
3.0,Good for the price but quite lightweight.  I have not worn them to the gym as yet.  Need to wear a sport bra with them for sure.
3.0,"I looked too wide on the hips , pretty color and nice fabric though. Just too bad I don't look good on it"
3.0,The color is pretty and the fit is ok.  What I have an issue is with the fabric became pilled and I didn't even wash it yet!  It got pilled just touching other shirts hanging in my closet.  I had to spend 15 min with the fabric shaver.  Disappointed.
3.0,Loved the product however it doesn’t hold up. Never got it wet never caught on anything. The band had a crease from where i ware it . Started to show after two weeks.<br />From there on you could see it expand until it broke .
3.0,"I really wanted to do some light skirts & shirts this spring/summer. I do like these skirts being light weight, the color selection,  and ability to wear with a tank top or dress it up. This did not flatter my wider hips however, the fold over top didn't help either. I ordered an xl, could have got a large. Either way, I just don't think it would have looked less bulky around my waist/hips. If you are more confident,  I'm 5'6, 150, then go for it. I'm not super body confident yet after gaining about 20lbs. It is an easy piece to add into your wardrobe."
3.0,"I ordered the long sleeved dress with the red top and white/flowered bottom. It fit well, was very comfortable and flowy, and the colors were gorgeous. What's the problem, right? The white skirt was definitely see through. I'm guessing the darker colors wouldn't have that issue but since there's no lining, the white definitely shows everything where there's not flowers."
3.0,"Not as pictured, the dress is straight but it is off shoulder, but it does NOT look exactly as pictured.  3XL fitted me a bit big and I'm 38C/D and 18 waist."
3.0,Love the color. Product is made of a very light material. May want to check if see through depending on size you order.
3.0,I was a bit surprised by the size of the pin.  It was smaller than I was expecting.  My desire was to use it for holding my work name badge.  The loop is just barely large enough for this.
3.0,"This was a gift, it was much smaller then we thought. Pretty but small"
3.0,"Great quality but the fit is off. The top fits perfect, but the bottom is way too large around the hips. Had to return it"
3.0,The top part I didnt like too much but it was a good fit for a jumpsuit.
3.0,Like it but fits like a shirt not a night gown. Not appropriate for wear in front of the kids
3.0,I finally had to replace my original belt. My old one I had for several years it finally was time to replace it.The new one definitely is of a lesser quality the company has sensed gone downhill Don't advise picking it up anymore.
3.0,"I loved how cute this sandal was, but it's pretty tight. My daughter has fairly skinny feet and small toes and the straps left marks after only 5 minutes of wear and her toes were spread pretty far. Sad, because I wanted more colors but I don't think they're comfortable enough for her."
3.0,Loved these but they turned very fast
3.0,very cute but the elastic broke the first time I wore it. But it was an easy fix. I just fed the elastic band through and re-sewed it.
3.0,Love it...super comfortable
3.0,Fits tight in the bust and the keyhole gaps wider than expected. I bought a medium and I'm a c cup. Other than that i really like the dress. The wine color is beautiful. The neck portion has a few odd edges but if i bought a size larger i dont think it would bother me.
3.0,It was ok. It is comfortable to wear. You could see the stitching on the sleeves and bat wings and fray strings on the stitching so it's pretty obvious to see. It was a little bit larger for me then I usually wear but I think this is comfortable and cozy.
3.0,I really like the style and how they cut it at angles. I ordered a red and it was more like a salmon color.  It was also not a stretch fabric.  Felt a little stiff. I recommend ordering a size up
3.0,My nose must be narrower or smaller than the average customer. The plastic frame with non-adjustable nose piece slides down so not good for viewing computer screen. The lenses and frame seem fairly sturdy.
3.0,"These are tighter and more structured then I anticipated. They are super warm, but because they are a little tighter, I feel like they flatten my hair. I only use them for taking my dog out to go potty in the winter because if I wear them anywhere else, they will either slip off or I will arrive looking a mess. However, they are very thick and good quality. I would like it better if it was a little more slouchy."
3.0,There is nothing on the back of the shirt. Not as described.
3.0,"I was really excited about this product to come in and once it was here, it does not look as great as on the photos(not necessarily a bad thing, but its just my personal feeling).<br /><br />As always, the wallet can only be as slim as the stuff you put inside it, right? I personally have an ID, 3-4 bills and 4 cards(I do not carry all the cards that I have on me). So, at this point its is fairly slim(again, &#34;slim&#34; is subjective)."
3.0,Soft metal for posts the bend easily when putting on the backs. Very soft metal
3.0,I should say the quality of this product is slightly below average. Does not last for long.
3.0,"It's too bright and shiny, looks like plastic. Isn't very long and not that nice."
3.0,"I love the design on this mask, but I was disappointed when it arrived because I didn’t think it was the accordian folded style. The photo made it appear to be the kind that is shaped like you face without horizontal creases. Because it does have them, and because of the silky fabric, it isn’t easy to breathe in as it doesn’t stay out from your face."
3.0,"While the quality was good, I didn’t find this dress to be very flattering. I returned it."
3.0,I love the jersey itself but the XL feels like a large and is way tight on me so I am thinking about exchanging it. Make sure you size up one or maybe even two sizes.
3.0,Arm holes were weird.
3.0,I got this for my mom as a gift but sadly after just a day she was complaining about how the time is constantly off even though she keeps fixing it.  Really wanted to like it but it just would not keep the time.  Had to return it
3.0,"It's cute, it does run small as all the reviews say. I ordered a large, I would usually order a size 4."
3.0,Not too bad. Not as thick as I’d have liked. Very cute.
3.0,I have a D cup and am 5’2 130 pounds. The small fit Lengthwise but the deep v neck was wayyyy to revealing.
3.0,Be sure to order up a couple sizes especially if you're top heavy! Nice deep color and the back is open so be careful ordering because I looked over that I guess.
3.0,"I bought this scarf based on the color shown since I would be wearing it with something that needed the right shade.  The scarf is as described, but the color is distinctly more orange than shown here.  It can show gold but goes very red-orange in different light.  It won't fit my needs at all, but would cost more than I paid to return it."
3.0,"So they aren’t completely broken but they dont fold up like they should because he pulled them off a bit to aggressively. We have other pairs that are similar which have survived the same vigorous pulling without deformation, so while the price was ok, I’d rather spend a couple bucks more on the ones that haven’t been bent out of shape in ten minutes."
3.0,Very cute but very cheap quality. My daughter wore them for about a week before her ears got badly infected..
3.0,"It's a cute concept. I'm 5'4&#34; - 120lbs - 32/34a and a small was weird. The top was slightly loose in the boobs but the arms fit fine and then no matter where I put the skirt it was too tight.. even when it was on the smallest part of my stomach. The grey was a light grey/washed out purple.<br />Again, super cute product but order a size up and only order if you have a rack.. honestly - even with a push up, I don't think I can fill this top out."
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter and her friend. They both love it, however, it seems to be very itchy. My daughter does not keep it on for very long."
3.0,Bought this to have in a second vehicle as my partner has one already and forgot to take it out of his personal vehicle when he went to work. This one is larger by an inch making it to loose compared to his current north face of the same style.
3.0,"The wrist cuffs are a little too tight for the size that i purchased. There is no give to the fabric. We expected something a little different I guess. The pattern is screen printed onto it, it's not dual layered, and the quality makes the pattern seem a little fuzzy up close. You get what you pay for, c'est la vie."
3.0,had to repair it
3.0,Great for pj wouldn't wear them out in public ..
3.0,It's just ok. Looks cool but lacks the comfyness of a sweatshirt.  It's not stretchy at all and the seams along the body have no stretch.
3.0,Love this one too but same situation applies.  I wear it different than the picture shows.
3.0,Very pretty lace top to bottom.  Especially like the lace skirt.  Shapely bodice.  Not stunning.  Not fond of the unlined lace arms.  Too short for heels over 2 inches.  Not designed for large busted woman.
3.0,"It's a decent watch but hard to read in certain lights. Also having to press the button every time you want to know the time gets a little annoying. Perhaps you can set it to where you can read the seconds for longer, but for me the screen goes off after about 8 seconds of displaying the seconds. I need it longer for work reasons."
3.0,"I was looking for a compression/thermal to wear under my scrubs at work. The product is decent for the price, but just not what I had expected. Some of the reviews said that they were warm, fitted and like a real compression shirt. I'm 5'5, 140 pounds with a DD chest size. I ordered a small in these. I was expecting a very tight fit but to my surprise they were still baggy around my stomach area and the most important place for me, the sleeves. I did not want to be constantly rolling up the sleeves when I'm wearing gloves. The material was also just very thin, and I wished they were a little thicker and warmer. The shirts would be great for some who doesnt like skin tight though!"
3.0,These jeans look how I expected. But they’re not high waisted like I thought. Also I ripped the belt loop putting these on very easily. And they were to small so I’d order up a size
3.0,"The chest is,a little tight."
3.0,"I got an extra large, but I am size L and now is a little big on me. Overall I like it, the quality is not great and the bra doesn't provide me with the support I need."
3.0,Be aware these are slim fit. Would have been nice to include that detail in the product description.
3.0,"Label was a sticker not printed on container and liquid inside has separated to 2 colors, have purchased before from different source and did not have this experience with it. I tried this product on an older pre 64 dime and it did clean it so idk."
3.0,I bought these for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She loses mittens all the time.  The clips look pretty ragged after two weeks of school.  They tend to come off the jacket easily.  Not as sturdy a clip as I would like.
3.0,Cute but finger tips are very tight and I have average to small hands with a size 5 ring finger.
3.0,fit fine the material is not great found something better so I returned it
3.0,The jacket fit perfectly but the pants are very tight in the thighs.
3.0,Returned as being 6”00 & 235 the length was not what I wanted. Barely covered the belt line. Quality seemed fine though.
3.0,It’s loose fit & long for me.  I ordered small & im 5’1 & slim but it’s long & didn’t fit right.  I’m returning it.
3.0,"It’s really cute, but it runs pretty small. I ordered two sizes bigger than usual, and it’s still pretty snug."
3.0,Sizing is off.  Extremely small
3.0,"These are good if you have a baby who is growing fast and won't be in them long, but I didn't think the quality was impressive as an item that would allow you to pass along to a second child or friend.  The stretch was minimal and didn't give in the diaper area the way I'd hoped they would"
3.0,The boots are very pretty but very narrow in the front.
3.0,I love it! Very delicate and beautiful but it seems too expensive. The necklace came with a stain on the pendant.
3.0,They are cute but my little man has made a few remarks they aren't very comfortable.  Something about the tounge.  He will wear them but I'm not sure that it isn't just for my benefit.  He isn't a big complainer.
3.0,Comfy but cheap material
3.0,"It's cute, but when I washed it the first time all the fringe frayed and got tangled in to this big knot."
3.0,Very pretty design.  Wrinkles easy and thin material
3.0,I love the way this skirt flows. The length is great and I'm 6'1 and it really long. I ordered a XXL and it still a little snug around the waste area. Overall I like it.
3.0,This fit as expected but is WAY too short to be a dress. I’m 5’3” and it was obscene.
3.0,"I paid extra for fast shipping & it did it’s part but the bra is missing , outfits looking good for the most part , disappointed this was for a party I was going to Friday"
3.0,"These were all n a sale or a deal and we're worth the price paid but... these run a size small. These are just okay, they tend to fall off of my daughter's feet even if I tighten the velcro strap down as tight as I can. I will use these as a back-up or if they match her outfit but they will not be her every day shoe nor will I re-purchase."
3.0,The sizing runs small. Have to get 2 sizes bigger then normal
3.0,"These flip flops look nice, there's no doubt about that, but they aren't comfortable on my feet. I was afraid I'd ordered too large, but they run small. My heel and toes come right to the ends. They also run narrow. I don't wear wide shoes, but I border on wide, and these are uncomfortably narrow. I feel like I'm balancing on them instead of feeling comfortable in them.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a size larger than you think you need and if you have wide -- or almost wide -- feet, maybe look elsewhere. If you don't, the soles are comfortable and look great."
3.0,"Comfortable and soft, fit a little big."
3.0,fits ok but was a bit disappointed in the quality
3.0,"Nice toe shape, but would have liked softer leather. Not much padding so added gel insoles & fixed the issue. Careful as outsoles are slippery."
3.0,"I have no problem with the fit of the mask. My son is 13 years old and these were perfect. The little pull tab that tightens/loosens the ear loop is not excellent but works well enough. I tried to find some without the wire nose part but the reviews were pretty good for these. The wire is fine, it is strong enough to stay in place and flexible enough to bend easily. My problem was washing them. I put them in a lingerie bag on delicate but the wire was impossible to re-position afterwards. I'm sure if you have the patience of a saint, you can move it back in place, a millimeter at a time but unfortunately, I do not have that fount of patience."
3.0,I like the head scarf its just not as stretchy as other ones I have tried and its pretty thick but It well be a better head scarf for the winter
3.0,nice shoes. just a little to big
3.0,Loved it... if only the earring backing was stronger. Lost both in a week
3.0,"We have many Disney store wands. They all light up pretty and or sing. This wands light is very dull and is nothing special!<br />And as others said, very Hard to press the button! But we kept because she likes the wand to match her costume, otherwise i would have returned! Disney needs to create a new wand soon, what a disappointment!"
3.0,"I was excited to order these because of the side pocket. However, I've worked out in them a handful of times and they have already developed a hole on the putter thigh, which really isn't a normal."
3.0,"The chemicals that they put in the school pool, ate away the top layer."
3.0,Looked good but didn't fit.
3.0,"Extremely quiet, but wrist bands are bit larger than the ""plug-in"" straps to hold watches securely while in motion.  I fixed that by adding a bit of padding under each strap."
3.0,The bag is an ok size. The handles aren't long enough. The description definitely does not say the inside fabric of the black bag is brown. The bag definitely stinks as other people commented. Due to the handle length and inside fabric color I returned the bag.
3.0,Colors were too NEON for me.
3.0,glad I ordered the large even though I wear a medium.  The large is a little snug in the shoulders but acceptable..  If ordering please order 1 size larger.
3.0,Great concept however it was hard to put on (strap very uncomfortable) and clearance inside would rub on the end of my nose(no I don't have a big nose) also wish the bottom didnt fit between your lip and chin...uncomfortable and hard to talk when on. Not for someone with a smaller face. My wife tried to wear and when she had it positioned correctly it would either go in front of her eyes and if she pushed it down it would ride on her chin. Overall a fair product with a great idea and poor execution
3.0,"I ended up returning this item.  I’ve purchased the faux wrap snoga in the same size and it fits great. However, this style with the ankle length leggings was oversized in the legs. It looked like I was wearing loose yoga pants under a baggy skirt. Quality isn’t bad but I’d probably expect better for the price."
3.0,I loved these but only got to use them a few times before the plastic snap broke and the strap can no longer attach on one side.
3.0,Cheap material. Tight in the arms.
3.0,pretty but not as stretchy as I would have liked.
3.0,It's cute and stylish - just the right length. It's warm. You can layer it with a sweatshirt if you size up.
3.0,These fall out of my ears a lot. I only wear a 00. They’re not very comfortable & I'm disappointed because they’re beautiful. They’re also glass & I thought they were plastic. They’re held on by O rings.
3.0,This shirt is super soft and comfortable. I have purchased it in different colors for sleeping in. I ordered a size up for a loose fit. This particular one got a hole after just a couple washings. Luckily it was on a seam and I should be able to stitch it up.
3.0,I really like that they are thin and soft for a wool sock but the idea that one sock is supposed to fit a shoe size ranging from 6-10 is ridiculous.  I wear 6.5-7 and the heel on these socks sits closer to my ankle.
3.0,"The watch has a great look with an almost black finish and the wood aspect makes it cool.  I plan on putting on my own leather wristband as the one provided is loose, thin, and feels cheap. Also, the hands on the watch tend to fall behind over time."
3.0,I love the fabric on this blouse but unfortunately the sizes are not true to US sizing.  I have large breasts so have to buy XL tops but the XL in this is too tight around the bust.
3.0,Would have one hairnet that the elastic was too loose. Other than that I still love them. Hopefully my next purchase will be better.
3.0,At 9.99 it was expensive for what it is. Other then that it ok
3.0,"Although this did not fit as expected like the picture shows with a flare sort of effect, it fitted me close all the way through almost hugging my body but its comfortable."
3.0,"I miss understood what comes with my order. I felt it came with mask & at least a filter. I received no filters for either mask. otherwise I like the looks of the mask, now have to look for some filters. oh well"
3.0,So cute and the right length but too big around my waist. I am 5’2 and 110 lbs. Unfortunately I will be returning :( would totally buy it if it came in xsmall!
3.0,I like this tote BUT will return because the straps are too short.
3.0,"The product is exactly how the picture is, which is nice because it's what I was expecting. The color is awesome, but this bikini doesn't have adjustments for the top so if you have a larger breast area I would recommend a size bigger than your usual size, the bottoms also run small but it is a thong bikini so its not a big deal if they are a bit smaller. There is no opening to remove the bra pads that are inside the top, which is a downfall because the pads are uneven and bumpy making the top look wrinkled. Other than that its a decent purchase, I wouldn't pay the same price again though for one like this."
3.0,The fit was not flattering at all. I’m 5’6” and the crotch was at my thighs.
3.0,Nice but nothing special
3.0,"no durability.  the seams are ripping out on both shoes. I've had them for several months, but they only see light use.  Sitting around drinking beer, occasional walk on trails, basic driving around running errands.  Nothing strenuous.  These are not my main footwear.  They are very comfortable, More narrow than other shoes. That doesn't bother me, as i have a narrowish foot.  They are extremely light, and very venti. I normally don't wear them on long drives (more that 4 hours) because my feet get cold and I'm too lazy to adjust the ac vents. The ventilation is outstanding for this hot Florida weather.  They lasted 3/4 of a year, which i find disappointing, as i'm used to getting several years out of shoes, even my hard use boots, but they really are comfortable, so i'm on the fence about buying another pair."
3.0,Love the style but I ordered a 7 and I got a 7.5. I didn’t realize it until I wore them one time and what started out as comfortable seemed to begin to stretch or loosen. When I got him I checked the box and saw it was the wrong size. I’m sorry I wore them but I do want to exchange them for the 7.
3.0,I got two for my nieces for Christmas and the white part keeps falling out and the ribbons did shred a bit. not terrible though
3.0,Love these but which the pads inside were the same size as the cup size.
3.0,I bought this item that was shown on black man what looked like a brilliant Fuchsia. It’s not. It is neon pink. I returned which was hassle less. Nice sweatshirt if u want the neon.
3.0,Too long to wrap snugly around neck — decoratuve not functional
3.0,"Cute Robe, fit just fine. Little skimpy on fabric at the bottom.  Won't buy again as on third washing it's piling...badly."
3.0,These don't fit little girls and they are not adjustable.
3.0,Neckline was unfinished and the waistline was much higher than I expected
3.0,"Looks a lot darker than it actual is, this item is light blue."
3.0,Great value just make sure your child had very skinny feet.
3.0,"These are fine for around the house.  I’m 6.5 months pregnant and they stretch and will likely fit my belly and body all the way to the end.  I marked them down though because the material is very cheap and thin, and they are super short.  I’m not tall, I’m only 5 foot 5 inches.  So for that reason I wouldn’t wear them out of the house, and I likely wouldn’t buy a second pair.  If you’re needing some comfy lounge pants for home though, they’re fine."
3.0,To small love the materials
3.0,Nice and cute but the elastic is too tight for my toddler and I don't think that her head is big.  It would be better if it was adjustable. I cut it to make it fit...that ended up in disaster.
3.0,A fine dress but way too long for me (I'm 5'1&#34; and about 120lbs). Returned the day after it arrived.
3.0,All I received in terms of instructions is a single slip of paper with incomplete instructions.  I hope I used it properly but can't be sure.  I have not tried to find a website for instructions since I didn't know what the company name was until I received the email asking for a review.
3.0,The tint is really nice. I felt like they were a tad smaller than the previous aviators I’ve purchased before but for the price they’re  decent. I got them cause I like a little variety and I’m planning on sharing with my brother.
3.0,Material feels too cheaplike for my taste
3.0,"The warmth of this jacket is great. What isn't great is that the jacket that I received had an issue where the stitching in one place on the liner was sewn crooked which left a hole where the liner attaches to the inside of the jacket. Also, the zipper pull is on the left side which is very annoying since it is usually on the right for men's clothing."
3.0,I have used this for snowboarding.  Wool is good quality and doesn't hold odor.  It is not heavyweight and your breath will freeze on the fabric causing ice buildup.  It made a good base layer under my beanie cap.  Thin material is very stretchy.  If you need something heavy for cold weather protection with minimal physical activity choose something else.
3.0,"The earrings are okay. It's a bit smaller than imaged; however, do not request gift wrapping. The wrapping looks used."
3.0,I had to give this to my daughter as it was way too small for me. She loved the lightweight feature
3.0,Skirt is nice but top is cheap and hugs to tight.
3.0,"Shipping took a bit longer that prime should be, but not so bad. The sweater is good looking but not warm at all. The quality is not as I expected. I wish I could return it but World Cup is already here and I don’t have time for it."
3.0,Great Delivery by Amazon as always.  Shirt is a tad big small on the shoulder but too wide around the waist.  If the shirt is exactly the picture than it is perfect.. instead of having a curve it is a square.. doesnt look good like that.
3.0,Smaller than I thought :/
3.0,"The color matches fine, but the metal button that snaps into the hole gets caught easily and comes undone. I have to refasten multiple times a day."
3.0,There is not a zipper as described.
3.0,"These are nice glasses and probably worth the price.  Unfortunately, one of the screws holding the earpieces on keeps working loose.  I have tightened it about four times now, but it keeps backing out.  I'm sure this is an anomaly and the vendor would be willing to send me a replacement pair, but the return time window is closed."
3.0,"I thought these would be like the other popular yoga/flare pants I bought on here. No. These are definitely lounge pants or pajama pants. Disappointed. I'm 5'3"" 128lbs size 8/10 in jeans. I got a large. Fit well except too long"
3.0,"It's a nice necklace, but the pendant is coated with something that is not meant to stay on."
3.0,Way too small . I have a small head it I can barely get it on . For the price they should specifically tell you it's very small . Kind of pissed about it.. this is for a small child not an adult
3.0,"This item has a great fit however the way that it was sewn is more like a boy shorts kind of like romper instead of like a bikini cut, I literally had to hike them up for it to look like the model they have on their photos! Just being honest. Reviewed this item for a discounted price."
3.0,The fit is great. Love how it looks. Not happy with the noise it makes when I walk. Has to be from the fabric.
3.0,Definitely buy a size or two up. They run very small.
3.0,This Runs a little small. Order 2 sizes up. I ordered XL and should have gotten 2XL.
3.0,I ordered a 3XL for a women - I am usually a 14/16 -- my daughter size 10 just fit it -- it is a nice looking jacket but be very careful in ordering.  check sizes and measurements carefully
3.0,"Very cute, fit my arms and the length was perfect, did not fit my bust (34DD)."
3.0,seems to be pretty cheaply made. But you get what you pay for. It's still intact and it's been a few months since I bought it
3.0,"runs small.  It's kinda nice, but just not for me."
3.0,"I loved this bag, the size was perfect and the compartments kept my stuff organized but the main zipper did break within a year."
3.0,"I guess I will have to hopefully get it altered. It is a beautiful dress but thier sizing is off. Ordered a 16 was just a bit to small so got an 18 and that's even small, except for bust and lenth."
3.0,"these rings came in a nice velvet presentation bag, but they were a little small and I buy rings often enough to know what size my fingers are.  Otherwise they came as described."
3.0,It did not wear like it does in the pic. I was disappointed as I had been eyeballing this sweater for awhile.
3.0,Hope to wash & dry a few times & hope fit remains as new.
3.0,Expected better quality of material.
3.0,"It's really cute, I'm  disappointed I had to return it. It just wasn't suiting my body style"
3.0,The dress is really pretty. Fits as expected.
3.0,"They are ok, looks like the picture but they were different sizes and fit a little loose. I wear a size 8 shoe. These are ok for a cheaper alternative to wear as casual fun."
3.0,"Its a beautiful piece with lots of shine, but the image makes it look deceptively slim. It has a chunky frame on the back to hold everything in place."
3.0,"I was disappointed in these rings. many had defects like they were cut and left with silicone hanging off the sides or pitting that made them look really cheap and tacky. They'll do in a pinch, but I wouldn't expect them to last. The braided bands also don't look like the picture and aren't as visibly braided as shown. They don't look too bad from afar, but when you get up close, you can see they are cheap silicone knockoff rings."
3.0,They are more bulky than the more expensive ones I've bought. I like a flat design where I can't even tell i have it on.
3.0,"Color nice.  Run very small.  Usually wear a 10, ordered these large on purpose to be bigger and roomier;  too tight for any sort of comfort.  Will never be worn, need to return."
3.0,Im 5'3 136lbs and wear 34D. It was too tight in the shoulders and across the top. I probably could of made it work if the material was stretchy but it has no stretch in it at all. I will be returning it.
3.0,"For the less then ten bucks I spent - worth it because my head isn’t AS cold anymore. I am not a “big headed person” by any means and this thing is constantly popping up and I’m have to tug it back down over my ears. Purported to be baggy fit, it’s not. Unless you are my little guy, almost two, and look like the perfect hipster."
3.0,Long time for delievery but daughter is happy about this accessory to her uniform.
3.0,"ALOT bigger than I thought it was going to be - personally too bulky for me, but for a really buff guy like the dude in Fast and Furious I guess it works. Lol."
3.0,"Fits my wife wonderful. She's very petite, 5'3"" and 110 lbs, but there is plenty of adjustability, so by a smaller size.<br /><br />Regrettably one of the shoulder straps burst at the seem after the first use. After inspecting the other seems it was discovered they all need reinforcement."
3.0,Nice piece for the price. Arrived on time.
3.0,"My 2nd purchase as my granddaughter went thru a growth spurt - she just turned 7, the 5/6 was too small. The 7/8 would've fit were she not tall for her age. They were impressed by the quality of the dress & said it's beautiful. As she didn't have the correct size for her bday, they're waiting for Christmas when I'll be there to have her real party - I'll update or review the new dress then!"
3.0,Liked the style but it was very short.
3.0,The bottom rides up to show my stomach. It’s too short for my torso. I hate the way it fits like that.it’s lightweight and all but not what I wanted. I like when it at least goes to the top of my jeans so my stomach isn’t out on display. And good luck bending over or climbing stairs it will show all the way up to your bra!
3.0,My daughter wears a 7 so I don't ordered the 10/12 and it is still to small.
3.0,"This item was really cute, but it was a little darker orange than the picture presented. It was also very thin and sheer where there was no concealing undergarments."
3.0,"rings are alright. nothing special.  They are true midi rings..they didn't look all that well on my hands, possibly cause my nails are not the length I hoped for...we'll see in the future what these rings are all about! :)"
3.0,This shirt did not fit like the picture. It was shorter above hip length. It's very nice material though and high quality.
3.0,Much heavier and more bulky than appeared.
3.0,"Ok  nothing to write about negative or positive.  for the price, cant really complain.  just basic cheap earrings."
3.0,I like the sweater but it fits a little awkward
3.0,Beautiful but huge.  Keeping it but will have to have a few inches taken in on the sides...underarms are truly hanging
3.0,"was too small, other than that very nice. they have stickers with the size on them, i peeled one off and it peeled a lot of the shoes coloring off with it. so be careful cause the colors come off very easy. easily scratched."
3.0,This product arrived with a broken clasp.  Very disappointed
3.0,the case smells like cigarettes. the zipper is noisy and hard to open and close.
3.0,Seems ok but fits really weird tight on the arms which is good but the bottom around waist is way too wide which looks stupid and isnt going to stay in place when grappling
3.0,"I bought the xxl. It barely comes to the knees, it doesnt button up and looks like it was made for a child. This was bought for my husband and I am very disappointed. It got three stars as it was made well. Has a patch on it for slytherin. Super cute, just warning these are kid sizing not adult sizing. My husband is 6 ft, 200 lbs. xxl did not fit him."
3.0,"It's a very comfortable skirt, but you get what you pay for.  Material is very thin and have to wear a long shirt (because I refuse to wear a slip!!!).  The cut of the skirt is off... with the hem at the hip straight, the front of the skirt touches the floor while the back of the skirt stops above my ankles.  I'm a size 4-6, with a very healthy, &#34;athletic&#34; booty, so I guess if you do not have a bottom at all, then the cut won't be so off.  Since the skirt is quite comfy, I'll keep for lounging around the house."
3.0,"Somewhat larger than expected.  Very pretty BUT the fringe isn't attached at all and it's constantly falling out.  Pretty soon there won't be any left!  I'm sure if I washed it, the fringe would be completely gone.  Sad because it's otherwise so pretty."
3.0,Very cute but a little big for my daughter. Wish there was a sizing chart.
3.0,The materials that it's made of are too cheap.
3.0,Works for what I wanted but other people said it ran small and they must've corrected themselves by then ok quality
3.0,Ordered this ring for my ring finger. I felt it was too big. Returned it.
3.0,I bit to big for my head.
3.0,"Very pretty and nice quality fabric. I returned it because it was too small. It appeared the bodice center was not straight but could have been due to being too small in chest. I'm not busty, so maybe it runs small."
3.0,A little big but its good quality
3.0,"I liked it, it's what I expected. The only complaint I have is that the charm where the words are engraved is not smooth"
3.0,"Beautiful skirt, the army/olive green color looks exactly as it's shown, the length hit perfectly at my feet. The only con is that it runs a bit on the small side."
3.0,Stone true to the photo.
3.0,This is a very pretty watch.  However the bracelet is too big.  The watch came with a little tool to use to take the bracelet appart but no imstructions.. we have tried to fix it but can't get it apart.  Not sure what to do with the watch now.
3.0,I love this dress and thought I bought the right size. I'm a size 8 and the dress was too tight. I made due by making my own modifications and adding a white camisole underneath and it was still one of the prettiest dresses I brought on our cruise.
3.0,"I received 6 masks.  All were supposed to be for a child.  They were all different sizes.  My daughter can only wear 4 of them.  I did message the seller and they gave me a partial refund.  I will not order from them again as each mask was a different size.  No two were stitched together in the same places.  They are super cute and comfortable, but I cannot trust that they will be the correct size for my child."
3.0,Loved these pants the fits was perfect but waayyyyyyyyy too long and I'm 5'6 so had to return them
3.0,"The product/band is completely different than what is shown on the product pictures. They are the same design as the Apple official sport bands, which might or might not be what you want (some people like the Apple version but don’t want to spend that money will definitely like like), but those that actually like the design from the ones shown in the pictures will be disappointed. I’m not sure if they actually ship those now but at least the ones I got weren’t as described at the time.<br /><br />The material is simply silicone and the surface becomes “rough” after a month or two but for the price you wouldn’t compare this to the Apple quality so that’s out of the question and I’m ok with this band. I wear it rough, I wear it when I play basketball (just by myself, just in case you wonder when I wear it when playing basketball), and the material is standing up ok, not smooth as it was when it was new but it’s ok. The problem with cheap silicon is the dust. The Apple one I had didn’t have that problem too often but this one has it. It’s just the nature of silicon I guess."
3.0,This is a TINY necklace. It doesn’t have an opening clip so that it can fit on. It’s on one chain that does NOT open. It would not fit over my 11 year old’s head.
3.0,"It is pretty, but the necklace won't  lay flat and it hangs crooked. The color doesn't  look like the picture."
3.0,"kinda too expansive. They look great but the carving is not well done, It is clearly done by a mechanical printer as it has horizontal layers to it. so considering the quality of the glasses themselves and the carving i do not see how it commands this price."
3.0,I'm 5'5 and 115lbs. The skirt fit but not as tight as I'd like. I'm going to just take it in slightly on the sides. The top is cute but your bra or boobs will show underneath that slit...just like the girl in the picture lol. I gave the top to my daughter. I'll wear the skirt with another top I have. The material is thin but not see through. Someone a little thicker with curves this would be super cute on!
3.0,Where the white decals were stuck together.
3.0,"I wanted to use these for turning metal skewers on the grill when making kabobs.  Technically, they kept my fingers from being burnt one time, so I'll give three stars.  But it should be noted the guards melted badly and couldn't be used a second time.  They might be fine for curling irons, where you're preventing an accidental touch, but I wouldn't rely on them for intentional touching of a hot surface."
3.0,I love the outfit in the picture in person not so much.. pants don't fit the way I would like but the outfit is cute. So I give it 3<br />Stars
3.0,SIZE UP maybe even 2 sizes up! No stretch so order accordingly!!!!!!
3.0,I should have listened to the other reviewer! Definitely NOT yellow. It's a nice over sized bag but the color is definitely Chartreuse. Attaching a picture to compare with product picture.
3.0,It was smaller than expected. I usually wear a Med or Large and I ordered an X-Large because of reviews I read and it is a little tight on me. It was also a bit thin and clingy on me and I wasn't expecting that. I haven't worn it or washed it yet so I don't know how it holds up under that. Overall I liked it but will probably wear something under it.
3.0,After the multiple negative review I choose not to go through with this product review. One perk I wanted was the pockets
3.0,the xtralarge is too small for a size 12-13 sneaker
3.0,"Color shown in pic (brown-tan) is not the same color as the one delivered which is more khaki. However, quality seems good, though I can't determine if the upper is made from leather.Commpared to the sandals available in local stores, this is a good deal for the price."
3.0,They’re absolutely great. Only issue is I only got 19 of the 20. Missing the blue snowflakes. :-(
3.0,Very nice style. The zips are not durable and will embarrass in public
3.0,I loved them but they only sent 3 ..
3.0,I Chose this Tee because I thought it would be loose fitting around the waist but it wasnt but over all its okay.
3.0,"I’m 5’8”, 38DD and size 20 pant and the XXL is too small. The sleeves are super tight and I can’t roll them. There is a good 3” gap where I should be able to button the dress. Nice soft fabric and I like the design. Just wish it fit."
3.0,This is just a little too flimsy for my taste. It's definitely a summer shirt despite it being long sleeve.<br />The fit is kind of slim but still loose. I'm 6ft tall and 185lbs. Ordered a Medium
3.0,When I had them get order .. I didn't know they were big not skinny ..
3.0,"Cute shirt, seems to be made well. I am normally a medium and ordered size small due to the description saying it is loose fit. The small is drowning me, it fits more like an XL :/ no time to replace before Christmas - super sad"
3.0,It's a pretty earring but I did not get the blue shown. I didn't returned it because my daughter needed an earring asap because she he hole started to close. what's funny if you take a pic with a flash it shows up blue.
3.0,"It doesn't fit all, definitely doesn't fit my boobs that much. Shows so much side boobs, it's better for girls who have a A cup or small B cup, definitely not C or D. I'm a C and shows a lot of side boobs so I have to put a cardigan to cover it up but other than that I'm in love"
3.0,This product is just ok for the money.  It really runs small!
3.0,"It was a decent watch band for the month that I had it before it broke. It fits the Samsung device securely but the band itself is fairly fragile. If you purchase it, do not plan on doing anything physical. Best bet is to keep your hands in your pockets and away from and surfaces. It will get caught, break, and fall to the floor."
3.0,Shell came off after day of wearing it . It was stuck with clothes
3.0,Well let say its not for summer the material is hot and heavy as for looks i now feel 65 i dont like that. One good thing the pockets
3.0,This is pretty well made and the actual item is nice. Description is misleading because the item that was sent was for a different version of the watch.
3.0,I usually wear a Medium but I ordered this in a size 6 and the fit was good. What I didn't like about this blouse is that its see through so I had to wear a tank under it which I didn't want to do but I had not choice.
3.0,"The fabric itself is good, but the cut of the shirt is too wide. I would say it's for husky kids. Also, the image looks washed out. It will work for my son's themed party, but I dought it will last."
3.0,"OK, for price"
3.0,Fit was ok. Fabric was ok. Army green color was more of a yellow-green than a leafy green as pictured. The pockets added unwanted bulk at the hips. I returned.
3.0,Nice but this hat looks like an irregular hat
3.0,They work well  I just can’t keep them from rolling down
3.0,"I would have liked it if it were the right size.... I usually wear a small or medium, and so I ordered a medium. (5'4&#34;, 125lb).  It was WAY too small! An extra large would probably fit good!  Man, if you like muffin top.... get this."
3.0,It is a little sheer on the bottom part so you have to be careful what type of undergarments you wear.
3.0,This could have been better made. Some rough patches here and there. It's a small bag too.
3.0,Very pretty and gave a nice sparkle for my little on stage for her music program. However after 1 wash almost all the shiny stuff on it was fine and then what was left ended up everywhere. Dress is ruined now.
3.0,"Very cute and size was adjustable, but granddaughter had already received a watch from her mom"
3.0,Some of these would not close once in my ears but the ones that didn't have issues have been great
3.0,"We are using these for play learning for my three year old twins.  We put the lights in balloon to bounce around in the dark.  We shine them on the ceiling and make discovers with how to make the light bigger and smaller, shadows, etc.<br /><br />So far, I have opened three of the packages (they come in packages of 4) and in each one only 3 of the 4 lights work.  So, it's low quality...but I sort of expected that so my disappointment isn't as high as it might have been if I were expecting better quality."
3.0,"I wear a size 10 shoe. Ordered a size 10 and it was much too tight. Very disappointed as they look and felt like they would be very comfortable, sturdy and well made slippers. A larger size is not available. If they had fit, I would have left a 5 star rating."
3.0,I like this shirt - it is cute and the quality is nice. I do not love the material though and the neckline is awkward - it is not deep enough maybe? I am not sure what it is but I am not a huge fan of wearing it.
3.0,Seem to be well made. Way to small for my glasses so I won't be using them much.
3.0,"These slippers are very cute, but the materials used aren't the best for an active little boy.  After only one use, the front portion of the brown trim is already shredding.  I would expect that to happen after a good 4-6 months of constant use, but after only one day, that's not good value for money.  The slippers are still usable, and they do keep his little feet warm, but I would have expected them to last a LOT longer.  I wouldn't purchase these again."
3.0,"Seller was great and delivery prompt, but I wouldn't recommend this ring since the black part of the band scratches easily to expose the metal below."
3.0,They are ok. But beware of super tough stuck on foods. These are very bendy so it’s not very rough.
3.0,Spend a few more bucks and get something of better quality.
3.0,"I ordered a size 32 since that's the waist size I wear in pants. But the belt is too small; it's snug on the second to last notch. The thing is that the buckle isn't permanently attached to the belt and allows you to detach the belt, cut it, and re-attach it. Therefore it makes sense to just buy the largest size and cut it to fit yourself.<br /><br />It's a nice looking buckle. I can't comment on the quality of it since I'm returning it and considering ordering the largest size, so I haven't had a chance to wear it."
3.0,Picture shows ability to read full lines. Mask cuts off edges of most lines due to the gathering. Disappointed. Got this to make a statement but others have a hard time reading it.
3.0,"I ordered a medium & it was more like a small. Quality was good, but order larger size than you normally wear."
3.0,"I purchased two of these of the same size, and selected &#34;fit as expected&#34; but truth be told, they fit very slightly smaller than expected (someone else posted that it fits larger, which surprises me).  No complaints there - it's within the range of expectations.  However, I rate the shirts overall 3 stars due to average quality (several loose threads, especially around button holes) and the collar is just a little bit narrow.  My biggest complaint, though, is that the length is a little less than ideal, i.e. they could be 1.5&#34; longer, thus allowing them to tuck in more reliably.  On a positive note, the striped style is exactly what I was lookng for to replace a couple of older shirts that have worn out.  I am wearing one right now, and basically, it's just about an average shirt for an average price, and little else."
3.0,Ok. Nothing to go writing home about.
3.0,"Super cute, but see through, so I'm not sure how I'm going to wear it"
3.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and the color is completely different from what is pictured. She ended up being okay with the color but it was not at all what we thought. The one we got is a bright hot pink. Not coral at all.
3.0,It was ok to relax in.
3.0,"I'm 5'4'' 145, ordered a large because of other reviews with snugness around torso and butt. The L fit great in those areas for me, but it was very loose around my chest - I'm barely a B cup. It's good quality and I can manage in it if I'm just lounging and not being active so I'll keep it."
3.0,"They look great, haven't wore any so my review is based on that"
3.0,I got this for my friend. She liked it
3.0,Comfortable boots but they are cheaply made. I don't see them lasting another season.
3.0,These are a good fit but they are not cotton cloth and very thin. So not really meant for COVID-19 protection.<br />Other than that it is ok quality. The seams started to come off after three times wearing them. You pay what you get I guess.
3.0,it’s super cute for summer :)
3.0,This didn't last long. It was broken within 2 weeks.
3.0,a little big but love it
3.0,It is cheaply made
3.0,"Bright colors, and nicely formed and decorated. Not built to last, but fine for short term."
3.0,"I've used this 2 to 3 times per week for 5 months. It is ripped and tattered. It looks nice, but not durable."
3.0,Dress was way smaller than a normal size large! Cute prints and pretty colors.
3.0,Charm is a little small but definitely worth the money.  It was bought as a gift for a pelican lover and she was thrilled.
3.0,Nice shoe but arrived with a zipper tab missing.  I didn't return them because the top of shoe doesn't show with pants and otherwise they are ok.
3.0,"I really enjoyed wearing these necklaces, they were danty, cute and look great when layered. However, after about 3 wears for about 8 hours they begin to fade and lose they're shine.<br />The one on the left was only woren 3 times, while the one of the right has yet to be woren which is unfortunate but you get what you pay for when you spend less than $10 on them."
3.0,"This was a good buy, however the green one started losing its color after couple washes."
3.0,"Pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for. It doesn't look very nice and looks like it could fray very quickly. But it gets the job done and it fits pretty nicely."
3.0,To me it looks good in the picture but it looks awful on.
3.0,Very nice ring! Just wish it came in size 14 because it would look a lot better on my middle finger.
3.0,This is great other than the button securing the top came off the first time I wore it.
3.0,"One of the clips lost its grabbing power within a month or so; it keeps slipping off my shirt. That's an uncomfortable feeling! Otherwise, they work as advertised.<br />(Also, this is not a complaint, but I wish I had paid closer attention to the length of the stays. Word to the wise: do that! I'm taller than average, and I can only use them at their full length.)"
3.0,"These sandals would be very confortable if they ran true to size. Ordered my actual size and they were way too small. Returned and ordered the next size up, but the width is tight so can't wear them all days as hoped."
3.0,verry pretty.. love the design.. blue gem fell off with in a day of wearing it.. easy fix but sad it fell off
3.0,It sits much shorter than it looks.
3.0,"This dress looks amazing on, as long as you don't move.  the inner skirt is so short! Even on my 5'2 frame, I felt like I was always in danger of showing the world my lady bits.  I love the dress, but I am trying to figure out how to correct the skirt so I can wear it more."
3.0,"I liked the detail of the item and of course the price. However, ypu will get what you pay for. The material is really cheap and it will roll near shoulders but nonetheless perfect for what I needed it for"
3.0,Like roominess
3.0,Very cute but runs a little tight..
3.0,"The shirt was really soft and comfortable, however, it was too big… I ordered one size larger than my normal size due to the reviews , but it just doesn’t look good oversized. I don’t think I’m going to re-order it in my normal size… The bottom of the shirt is not cut straight across which I would prefer if it was more fitted."
3.0,"The watch is very pretty, just as it looks in the picture... or even better.  BUT, it is very large and heavy, and doesn't sit comfortably on my wrist.  I put it on here at home and it felt bad, but I wanted it!  So I kept it on for a while, trying to get used to it.  I had to give up within less than an hour: it rubs on a nerve, or maybe a vein.  Perhaps others won't feel the pain that I did.  I am accustomed to wearing a watch every day - full time- but this large watch has no future on my arm.  I'm sending it back.  Also, was surprised to learn that I will be paying a re-stocking fee of $10.95 as well as the return postage."
3.0,the top of the cap does not fit snug to the top of your head like a traditional running hat.
3.0,"They look nice, but if you have a butt and larger testicles and average penis, they're too small :("
3.0,"It's okay at best.  For some reason, the front of the neck rides up and feels like it's choking you and the shoulder material stretches to the front.  Feels poorly made."
3.0,I got a ton of one or two shapes and not many of the others. Most In silver. I wish there was the variety like shown in the images
3.0,"I like it a lot but it keep breaking over and over again, at the top loop that holds the watch and wings together."
3.0,Great fit but the color is off. The pink is more of a brown. Also material is kinda shiney.
3.0,"The quality of the bracelet is fine, however the size is not close to accurate. I wear an 8 inch bracelet and this is too small to wear."
3.0,Did not stick too well to my skin and it made a weird fold on my breast that showed in the dress
3.0,Good all purpose sunglass for the money
3.0,I am almost always buy this size of pearls for my earrings but after these came in the mail the other day they just look so small. I even compared them against other earrings that I had that were 10 MM and they were noticeably smaller
3.0,"If I could go back I wouldnt buy again. VERYY thin material and not warm at all. I live in Arizona and our winters arent very cold...<br />I got a small, (im 54 and 110) and its veryyyyy loose on me. not flattering. Was hoping to buy a cute jacket i could dress up, but this was a hard no"
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the sizing chart that they refer you to is way off. I ordered this based on the chart thinking that an XL would be a tight squeeze, and instead, I think I now have a very cute circus tent. I'm going to exchange it for at least a size smaller, and I wonder if I need to go down too sizes, instead. The fabric is polyester and somewhat thin, but I expected that for this price."
3.0,"I love the way this shirt looks in the ad but it's small, not loose fitting at all.  I will keep it but the picture is very inaccurate."
3.0,"I like the dress, it fits well. But, if you hate ironing (like I do) this isn't the dress for you."
3.0,"The fabric was soft was was much thinner than I expected.  For me, it also fit smaller than I though it should have.  I returned it."
3.0,These are so cute! The only thing that was disappointing was that the picture and description make you think they come with an elastic head strap and they do not.
3.0,The waistband gets all twisted🤷🏼‍♀️
3.0,"The dress is nice, runs small"
3.0,"Not the color pictured. This shirt is a dark fushia color, not the purple pictured thus the 3 star rating. It fits true to size."
3.0,"The top part is very loose fitting. The material is light and thin, you will need to wear some type of undergarment. I am 5’7 so the skirt it too short for me, barely covers my backside so I can only wear it with leggings. I wish it was a little longer."
3.0,"The slides are very very cute, but i would say they run a size and a half too small. They fit but are a bit tight (i ordered one size bigger than usual but still a little tight). Also the rhinestones look like they may easily fall off. I hope not because i really like how they look."
3.0,"the watch was really good. it went along with any clothing. however there were times it was slipping back time, hope this is not a frequent problem"
3.0,"Love the color and bag but the shoulder strap has already broken, I've only had the bag for 2 days. Please send another!!"
3.0,"This dress is not a bandage dress, which means it would be pretty thick material and not very stretchy. This dress is made of pretty thin material and does not suck in anything or hide anything.  It fits fine, true to size, I usually wear a medium and this medium fits well. The top part is pretty tight, which is ok so nothing falls out. But overall it kind of looks a bit cheap, which it was, so I guess you get what you paid for."
3.0,Names are good size I can read them but stones you cannot see at all need a magnifying lens to see.
3.0,"I LOVE these hats! They came in three weeks, and they were in great condition! I don't know if its because my head is big (lol) or because my hair is very voluminous and curly but it won't fit...<br /><br />I'll straighten my hair and maybe I'll have better luck! But they're still cute! 😍"
3.0,Very nice watch I loved it but broke soon after I bout it when I tried to wind the watch it wouldn't work it just kept moving the hands
3.0,It was okay for the money but it really just looked like a swirl of color; couldn't make out the tree as is the picture.
3.0,"Bang for the buck, couldn't find anything around this price at any other store (15.80USD on December 2017). About the build quality, you get what you pay for, can't complain. I wanted it for a single-use occasion so I'm completely fine with the price vs. quality.<br />You should definitely buy 2 sizes larger. I wear L or XL shirts, I measure 47 in. chest, So based on other buyers reviews and product availability, I ordered the XX-Large (there wasn't anything larger). It buttons up nice, but I could have used half an inch more. Length is somewhat short too, I'm 5'9 and it's right on the edge where I wanted it to be, covering the belt 1/4 inch below my belly button, I'm guessing anyone above 48in. chest and above 6ft tall might have issues with this one. It'd be safe to say to avoid this one if your chest measure is &#62;=50in."
3.0,I love the bottom and the waist on this swimsuit. The issue is the bust area looks off. However it’s pretty cheap. I’ll continue using it.
3.0,Product was smaller than other similar I own.  Material a little thin.
3.0,Very nice jumper but the v neck is very low cut. Also I am 6'1 and its about 3 or 4 inches too short for me. I wish I could find romper or jumpers for tall girls :-(
3.0,"A lot of bows for the price but not the best quality. The fact that you get almost every color in the rainbow is a plus. I'd buy again, but probably wouldn't use these for special occasions. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"We purchased these for a family vacation coming up. After reading various things about them and checking the size chart I went up one size for everyone in my family, and they fit great! My toddler is normally a 3t or 4t and I got her the size that is similar to 5t. The men's shorts have the same swimsuit material as the women's suits, they are lined but there isn't a separate ""underwear"" insert inside. Overall, very cute. The women's bottoms are high rise and hit just bellow my belly button."
3.0,shirts come too small
3.0,"If you have boobs, not for you. But it wasn't made to bad."
3.0,After a few weeks the color wears completely off to leave a dull silver.
3.0,"Cute, very thin material. Have to wear something underneath. Makes a good bathing suit cover up.<br />Not worth money to return though."
3.0,"Returned. I wanted it to be cute, but ended up feeling matronly and yet childish at the same time. The fit was great, but the neckline was oddly high. It might look wonderful on a A-C cup bust, but any larger than that looks awkward.<br /><br />Few things to note:<br />- The material appears shiny in the pictures, but it is matte.<br />- Without any kind of underskirt, this dress goes past your knees.<br />- Came out pretty wrinkly so prepare to steam or iron"
3.0,"This is a pretty necklace.  It comes with a light chain in a small jewelry box.  I'd take it out first before putting it back in to gift, though.  I don't know why it says gold plated, because the necklace and pendant are silver, and I don't know of any silver-colored gold, but I have no way to test it.  It's nice for a cheap necklace, though."
3.0,thought it would be a bright white.  It was a stretch material...thought it would be more cotton.  It hung very well though
3.0,"I bought these for my husband. He goes through socks so quickly. After 1 wash they shrunk. I mean they  looked like a kids size. But I was surprised that they still fit his feet, size 10. We will see how late my these hold up. So far so good 😊"
3.0,"I returned this wallet because it was not at all what I hoped for or expected.  Although the price made it clear it was NOT leather, it is stated to be leather.<br />The red is two tones of red - which I find clashed and I did not like.<br />The wallet was much thicker because of all the various pockets, even if I did not fill it. Some cards stuck out too far, and money was only fitted in one of the two pockets offered.  The quality seemed plastic and I am thinking it would not last more than a few months.<br />I continue my search."
3.0,These pants are cute but do not fit well in the crotch area. They are way to baggy.
3.0,"There was a smudge, and the material is eh.. it tore the moment I touched the bottom seam part, little bit baggier than I wanted it to be. Besides that it's cute."
3.0,"They have wiggle room, don't have to fear they won't fit. I'm 5'3&#34;, and normally wear a 10-12. The problem lies within the wash and detail. For instance, after its first wash the leggings/Jennings pillaged. Aldso, the pocket detail (jewels) are VERY cheap looking; dollar store gems."
3.0,"Nice hat, but smaller than expected."
3.0,Larger than I expected ... I got first the size Medium ...huge for my son. Then I got a Small and they are still to big for him.
3.0,I ordered the wine red color. When it arrived it was a bright red color and not what the picture showed.
3.0,"These definitely look cheap. The studs look terrible, so I haven’t worn them, just Santa, the trees, and the reindeer. The reindeer are huge, Santa is pretty tiny. I didn’t have any issues with sensitivity, even with recently pierced ears. Overall it’s a decent selection of fun holiday earrings... but I could’ve gotten the same quality at Walmart for half the price."
3.0,The dress is ni e but it runs small.
3.0,i gave as a gift
3.0,Cannot be monogrammed
3.0,CHEAP PLASTIC
3.0,"Stitching is coming apart. Want the pants, but they were on sale, and my only option was to return, not exchange, so guess I'll keep them."
3.0,They don't hold for larger breasts (C or above). I am D and the top part that lifts starts to peel within minutes even under a bra!
3.0,This ring looks and fits great. The only thing I do not like about this is that it is very light in wieght. I wish it was heavier but it still looks great also shipping could be faster.
3.0,I previously reported that my package did not arrive but I found it....high winds blew it from where it was placed  down behind several objects nearby.  Sorry for the erroneous complaint.
3.0,This was a youth size large. I needed a women large.. the item was returned.
3.0,Beautiful but unsnaps if too heavy
3.0,Order a size or two bigger. I’m 5’7 160 and ordered a large. It’s just a little to tight and short in the arms.
3.0,"It fit but not as adjustable as I would like. I am 5’2” & 210lbs, it ties in a very small bow around my waist, but I would prefer one with longer ties around the waist. I hope that made sense. The quality seems pretty high quality for the price though!"
3.0,"5 stars for:<br />Beautifully made sweater. Yarn is soft and very comfortable and the knitting is high quality. The length was exactly as pictured, just perfect (I’m 5’6”). I really wanted to like it.<br />Dropped to 3 stars because of :<br />Unfortunately, the large was too snug around the bust (I’m a 38D) but the shoulders and sleeves were really big and boxy. I tried the medium, thinking I’d just button it half way up but it would only work around my torso if I chose to never button it and it still has a boxy feel to it. I returned it."
3.0,I got a large but it was still shorter that i preferred and the material is thinner that it appears.
3.0,very uncomfortable especially in toe area
3.0,"Fits well. Seems durable. But the silver ring was just coated to make it silver. Within a day half of the silver was worn off. By day 3 it is just a white silicone ring. Other than that, I like them!"
3.0,"The dress was too big on me and looked like a sack on me. For reference, I am 4’11”, around 98-99 lbs and am pear shaped.  The dress came to just above my knee.  There was so much excess material on me that it was unattractive.  I am returning."
3.0,Alot smaller than in pictures
3.0,Not at all what I expected. Just a beanie with 2 lumps not at all like ears. Looks honestly stupid. Cozy though
3.0,I have round ribs and the bottom line is too thick&stiff so when I wear tight clothes you can see the silhouette of the bra.
3.0,The bottoms are a bit small.
3.0,"Bought these for a trip to the snow with my 3 and 5 year old. Upon arrival there are two like it says however only one pair had a tinted lens. The other was clear rendering it useless on a sunny snow day. They fit well and stayed pretty fog free, but  ultimately they ended up not being used that day because the kids were fighting over who gets clear and who gets tint."
3.0,"Material was too hot for me...<br />Got enough heat going on by myself.<br />Otherwise, style is cute."
3.0,Even smaller then they said.
3.0,That's a cute ring but somewhat expensive for the quality
3.0,The material was comfortable unfortunately the shirt shrunk after 1st wash.  On a positive note the seller was very understanding and made it right.
3.0,Cute dress and fit fine but the decorative buckle in the back really scratched and irritated my daughters back.
3.0,"It's very nice, but huge. It's a men watch."
3.0,The quality was okay and they don't look bad.  Mine did not float at all which was unfortunate.
3.0,Nice. Haven't worn but once. Weather here been in the 80's. Comfy.
3.0,"Item arrived as described. Luckily 8.5 was the rite length. Only thing is, after a while, the leather encasing the cord wears and breaks where the bracelet makes contact to table tops, etc."
3.0,"Brigada's black watch with a white second hand is  a very basic theme for a watch display. Not the most exciting of minimalistic watches, but it does have an automatic movement. There are no numbers on the watch dial, the hour marks are on the bezel with impressed lines in the metal and are hard to read. The hour hand is in black which blends into the black watch dial and it is very hard to tell the time in low light or indoors, if Brigada had made both hands in white contrasting the black background it would be a much better design. The strap is a two piece construction that is glued together and with my experience will not last long before it starts coming apart and will need to be replaced. I like minimalist watches which have become a growing trend, but as it stands this watch is to basic, nice try as an art piece but not a very good watch."
3.0,"I got two left wings instead of a left wing and a right one... They're very pretty otherwise, but it kinda looks weird once they're on lol"
3.0,"The description said to order one size smaller, but unfortunately it did not fit.  I did like the jacket and the design of it."
3.0,"I like the fabric print and colors and feel of the fabric, very soft. Wonderful for a hot day. I was under the impressions it was cotton, tag says 95% polyester, 5% spandex. Also the seam was ripped. I can fix it but............."
3.0,Cool belt
3.0,I ordered the black and white pattern with horizontal designs and was disappointed the two legs do not match up like in the picture....not even close.  Perhaps in a different pattern this wouldn't matter but with this one they look cheaply made. The material is buttery soft and the size was spot on.
3.0,Been less than 2 months since I started using the cap.<br />Colors have faded with some white streaks (and dust lint).<br />Still covers my head so I'm wearing it but would not say it's the best quality.<br />The best caps brand from my experience so far is BUTITNOW (the only one that didn't fade).
3.0,I wish they would have helped my daughter's ears. They got so infected
3.0,Somewhat thin material and doesn’t stretch much so order appropriately. It’s a simple dress but was worth the purchase price.
3.0,Runs very small! Returned a smaller size and reordered a bigger size for that to fit the same.
3.0,good for the price great as a beach coverup
3.0,These are pretty thin. They are warm but don't feel like they will last long.
3.0,"I like the size and look of the watch face.  Unfortunately, the watch is incredibly hard to adjust in size.  It comes with a pin that is too small to grip well and I have not been able to change the size yet (in a week) so, at the moment I am stuck wearing a watch that is too big.  I would not buy it again due to this challenge."
3.0,"For the money I didnt expect much but they have worked for me. My first bag had its strings untie within a day, but the others have had no issues."
3.0,Runs a bit shorter than the others I purchased. Still cute.
3.0,Great idea but glasses are very cheaply made. Difficult to replace batteries without breaking the glasses.
3.0,"I loved the robe when it arrived,  If you're not using it as an after shower robe--buy it!  I, however wanted an absorbent shower robe, and this is not what I needed.  I am returning it and will buy another robe that fits my needs.  Too bad, I loved the robe and color (turquoise)."
3.0,the last tab is too long for my needs ... tough ... too tough for what I use it for ... otherwise good product
3.0,"it doesn't hold much if you have an iphone6 in an otterbox, it pops the zipper apart..."
3.0,It was delivered on time & well made!
3.0,"Glasses are cool looking and all. I figured I’d buy a pair of “knockarounds” for the beach and jetski. I have to stay, they stay on your head and wont fall off. I gave 5 stars for comfort and looks.<br /> I was hyped I finally found a pair of glasses I could rock at a fair price. However after the 4th time wearing them, I literally jumped into the water off a kayak and they broke. Obviously the quality is poor and I personally believe spending $25 was too much for glasses like these. Cheap quality, cool looking. Go find yourself a better pair for 15 bucks."
3.0,"it  came a few days earlier than expected, but it doesn't look new(not quite as shiny and a few spots in the creases of the earring). it came in a little gift box that seemed to be too big for the earing(looked like it was meant to fit two earrings in it. the box looked old and there was dirt inside the box). it fits my ear, but is a little tight around the top. A little hard to get it on, but once it's on, no amount of shaking could get it off unless you plan on baby-sitting a five year old, then all bets are off.<br /><br />The earring still looks nice and I still got a few compliments on it, so it's not entirely disappointing, but I do wish it was actually ""new"""
3.0,"material thinner than I expected, but its pretty and I will wear it on the 4th"
3.0,"My son wanted a durag, these came with a wave cap. The durags don’t stay on throughout the night, so my son only uses the wave cap to keep his locks in place."
3.0,"I want to love these, but they’re too heavy for me and leave a mark on the bridge of my nose.  I tried to tough it out because I love the look, but I just couldn’t handle the discomfort.  Part of the issue I believe is the fit is a bit big for me."
3.0,"They are comfortable and a good fit. However, I ordered the Hunter Green color and the ones I received are Grey."
3.0,Dislike it becouse the fings was messed up had to cut them off for great
3.0,Ties are super cheap and thick... it's hard to tie a double Windsor
3.0,"Color is very pretty, fit is good, but it's a pain to iron the cuffs after every wash.  Stretchy and comfortable otherwise and well made.  I anticipate having these for a long time."
3.0,To small but I love them
3.0,"Seemed like the perfect shoe -until one of the top shoelace loops ripped within the first week or two of wearing it. My 10 year old is hard on his shoes, but even this seemed like<br />Normal wear and tear to me. Doesn’t impact the use of the shoe otherwise, so these will not be our primary shoe due to the rip."
3.0,I thought it would be made of material and not that big.
3.0,Looked good at first but fabric started pilling after first wear. Looks old and worn out now and I haven't even washed it.
3.0,The rings arrived yesterday. A few days before expected date. I was really happy when I saw them. But when I tried them on I saw that they didn't fit me. They were too big 😭 I tried to bend them inward from the ends one on top of the other and they barely fit. I can't wear them like Tae gong shil lol but still not bad
3.0,"so far they are nice. i am very partial to the tint that sunglasses have though and these ones, while fire red reflective has a blue tint when looking through. I love the amber tint so im kinda annoyed but its not the end of the world."
3.0,Already coming apart inside. The pocket has come Unsown.
3.0,Was a gift so I cant say anything
3.0,"Due to the material, this looked more like pajamas when I put it on. It is now my new gown for sleeping. I do like it though!"
3.0,The fabric is NOT what I thought it would be and does not look like the picture.
3.0,"A lot of the comments said that this shirt runs baggy. I dont like my clothes baggy so I ordered the size I normally wear and it fits me fine. I like the material, and the top is cute overall. However within 2 hours of wearing it the plastic piece that holds the strap broke and now it randomly falls off."
3.0,Beautiful boots...made for small people
3.0,"So glad I finally got a less noticeable and in your face septum ring. I've used all 3 colors already and the silver and gold are my favorite since they're very subtle in photos and in person.<br /><br />As for quality, this could be worked on since you can see where it cuts off or open and close, its not an infinite seamless circle (only the gold one looked the most clean cut and made). It was really noticeable up close and also kind of pokey when you run the septum in and rotate it.<br /><br />I think for the price I paid, I expected for a better quality but it does its job and haven't broke yet so I'm good. I think there are cheaper and better quality septum hoop rings on amazon so I will be buying it somewhere else if the price is right or the quality is better. But if you just need a set super quick like I did, I'd purchase these!"
3.0,They were short on me and my oldest.
3.0,"I purchased two Kids Elite Tactical Vests for Christmas for my children.  I was hesitant of the product because of the purchase price, and my initial fears were realized when I received two vacuum sealed brick-like products from Amazon.  I was able to unwrap the vests and orange bullet clips to determine what was supplied. Separate reviews, in my opinion, are warranted.<br /><br />Vest: This is a cheaply constructed vest.  I do not expect it to last a year, as the material is quite thin.  Children, naturally, can be rough when playing Nerf gun wars and battles.  I fully anticipate this vest being torn before too much longer.  It is also quite large, so if your kids are under 70 pounds, it will be a bit loose on their body.<br /><br />Bullets: These are fine, but I was not buying the product for the bullets.<br /><br />Orange Clips: These are quite odd.  In my opinion the clips are far too large for the vest, and seem flimsy when attached in the location indicated by the photos.  The clips also do not fit in any of the guns my children own, so I am not really sure what to do with the clips.  Right now, the clips are in a closet, and they will likely be transferred from there to the trash.<br /><br />I give this product 3 stars based on the price, the vest and the bullets."
3.0,I love the look of this and how easy it is to put on. The lever to change it out though is very touchy and my band/watch fall off daily with normal wear.
3.0,Didn’t have the shine as pictured.
3.0,This beret won't fit someone comfortably with a 22&#34; hat size.
3.0,Meh. Would not order again
3.0,Bonito el modelo pero la Tela y botones no muy buena calidad
3.0,"The bracelet is beautiful, but I am afraid to wear it because it unsnaps so easily and  I am afraid it will drop off."
3.0,"Very pretty.  However,  they run very small.  I ordered a large,  then an xtra large and they both were too small.  I normally wear a size 12"
3.0,These socks are well made. The colors are really nice. I line dryed them (directions said not to put them in a dryer.) They are not tight enough and are not giving me the compression that I need in my ankle and heal. But they fit perfect around my calf. I wear a 9 1/2 women's shoe so I bought the l/xl and I'm thinking I probably would have been better off buying the s/m but I'm not sure.
3.0,"Cute but the print is fuzzy. Not fitted, just a flat piece of material. Not protective for Covid or airborne diseases."
3.0,Rash from band. Would not recommend.
3.0,"I love this bag, and it actually is a very soft pink which matched my dress perfectly, but one of the rhinestones fell out before I could even carry it.  I'm sending it back for a replacement and hope that it stays intact."
3.0,I like the style and tie dye look on this dress but it fits way too tight and really tight in the chest if you are size C or higher in cup size. Fabric is rough feeling and doesn’t fit comfortable. Not impressed with it to be honest.
3.0,"They're cheap socks, but they were very inexpensive, so no surprises here. If you're looking for a quality sock, keep looking. If you want an inexpensive sub par quality sock (like we were at the time) these are great."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift, and right away one of the pins holding the strap came out and the strap fell off right away!  I was able to get it put back on, but I’m disappointed with the quality control! I really loved this design with the skull and my boyfriend loved the look too. It’s a pretty large dial, a chunky watch! The only button that does anything is that middle one, for setting the time. The outside dial turns but it is not a real diving watch. I’m happy with the look, but I think it could have been cheaper priced."
3.0,"Like another reviewer said- weird dress. Looks hilarious as a dress; nicer as a cardigan. Makes me look fat when worn as a dress ( looks baggy yet you can see my underwear)  .. looks very short and I’m 5’2”. Not sure if I’ll keep it but it looks okay as a cardigan. The color teal is not as pretty in person and the buttons are a rusty bronze color, not white as pictured. Wrong product maybe?"
3.0,"Only bad thing, wore out to fast, but I wear them a lot more than normal"
3.0,"As a &#34;one size fits all&#34; type of product - as most tights are - the fit is always a bit disappointing. However, I have to say it fits &#34;as expected&#34; because I always &#34;expect&#34; a poor fit. I have thick thighs and it is definitely not made for women with thick legs. If you are not a super thin person, you may want to rethink any kind of thigh high tights or socks."
3.0,"I ordered this in Navy Blue, and it came in MEDIUM Blue, so it's not dark at all.  I tried it on in Large (I'm about 5'6"" and 165lbs, carrying more weight in the middle and the bust), and it fit perfectly OTHER THAN the arms were baggy/loose which didn't look great.  I had read another review by a woman of similar height/weight who said a Large was too big on her, so I almost ordered the Medium, but I'm glad I didn't.  Also, the dress isn't low-cut at all as pictured (though maybe you could pull it down a little?).  I RETURNED it and ordered it in Wine in Large, and it came in a darker RED color (not really any purple or brown which would make it look like wine).  The arms fit a little better, though it was a little shorter (definitely mid-thigh, so for me, more ""mini"" than ""midi.""  Quality control clearly isn't there, but for the price, I'm keeping the RED one."
3.0,The Material was thinner than what I was expecting.
3.0,Pretty but to small for tragus
3.0,"Looks nice (but not quite as nice as the picture) but it broke apart first time my wife wore it.  Fixable but not awe-inspiring, for sure"
3.0,It Is not red like in the picture. Its burgundy. Looks ok.
3.0,Need it bigger.
3.0,"WXXM Athletic Ankle Socks are a very nice sock for those seeking to join the ankle sock craze. The socks are comfortable, the toe area is a bit thicker than the rest which adds comfort and durability to the socks. I also like that there are breathable elements of the sock and it has attractive styling albeit aggressive branding.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fit and feel. These socks feel good against the foot and they didn't contribute to a ton of sweat while working out even in hot outdoor conditions<br />- Styling. Ankle socks are all the craze now and these socks won't show even when walking or running. When you remove your shoes the socks have a signature styling to them that fits with athletic apparel.<br />- Comfort. There are breathable elements to this sock as well as a bit of padding around the toe area. This meant activities like basketball, boxing and jogging were not hindered at all by these socks.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Wouldn't always stay put. Until I had broken these socks in a bit they wouldn't stay put within my shoe. During my first couple of weeks with this sock, I had to remove my shoes and reposition the socks at least 2 or 3 times each day. That improved as the socks got broken in but there were still times when I had to reposition the socks even after weeks of usage.<br />- The WXXM branding is literally front and center with this sock. They're no show socks so I really don't understand why this bold choice was made. The lettering could have been several font sizes smaller.<br /><br />Overall, these socks are comfortable, functional and stylish. However, it is very important to pick the right size with these socks. Order them too big and they'll lose the no show effect everyone seems to covet these days. Order them too small and you'll have to break them in, that is, stretch them out a bit just for them to stay put and not ride up your feet during vigorous activities. Comparatively speaking, these socks are OK. They didn't exceed my expectations at all but I wasn't disappointed by this product either. Translation, if these socks were gifted to someone I think they'd wear them but it's doubtful they be the first socks out of the drawer."
3.0,"VERY lightweight, but zippers are not good"
3.0,Ordered a large. Neckline stretched out after one use and looks sloppy now. Armholes are pretty big so the fabric sticks out. It is super soft and comfortable though. Not really worth the price.
3.0,Very cute and comfortable.  Look really nice until I washed them.  They pill up very easily.
3.0,Pretty dress great fabric just runs big!
3.0,Cheap feeling and looks cheap. They will do for work outside.
3.0,"material is weird, but cute fit"
3.0,"I received 1 product in a crushed up box, and the other didn't even come in a box. Both were protected in thin plastic wrap. Overall mask fit my little ones and color & patterns matched as described."
3.0,Simply too small to replace regular wallet. Way overpriced too.
3.0,This is more of a earth tones then the rose quartz or moonstone coloring.  But it's still a pretty necklace/bracelet
3.0,"Hat received has a large ugly &#34;Page One&#34; logo on it (front and center).  The hats in the images obviously do not have the logo printed on them.<br /> It is not a problem with the camera angle, the logo simply is not there in the online images.  Because of this I will not wear it in public.  The ugly logo makes this hat suitable for yard work only."
3.0,"Frankly disappointed in these tights. While I followed the sizing guide and purchased the M/L version (I'm 5'6&#34; at 140lbs so it should work) these tights would better fit someone 6 feet tall. The legs were way way too long and bunched up around the knee before sliding down the ankle. Thank goodness I was wearing high tops with them and was able to bunch all the excess fabric around the ankle. They're super cute and I did end up wearing them, but only because I had no other alternative for the costume. Quality's great. Length is way too long."
3.0,Very cute- fit well-but its see threw material and semi short.
3.0,Nice pendant but chain is way too small to fit around my sons neck.
3.0,"Pretty, but not finished very well.  I had to buy some matching yarn to repair some dropped stitches that would have otherwise unraveled and ruined the headscarf."
3.0,"This necklace has a very thin chain and a very small pendant, and would probably only be good for a young girl.  I suspect that the woman in the product photo is very petite.<br /><br />This item is 14k gold fill, which if you know much about jewelry, it means that its probably going to be hypoallergenic, which is a good thing.  But it also means it has an extremely small amount of actual gold in it. It would be difficult to consider this as buying an asset that will hold value.<br /><br />I think this would be good for a gift.  Overall, I don't really recommend it."
3.0,The glasses are nice but the navy blue is purple.
3.0,Micro size. Cute but really really tiny
3.0,I doubt these would make it through one gentle cycle in the wash before being useless.
3.0,"Cute shirt but it's very cheaply made. The material is not soft AT ALL, which is a huge let down for me. It's also bigger than what I expected it to be. I'm a true medium and while it fits lengthwise, it's wide fitting on the sides. I wouldn't have paid $17 for this shirt had I seen it in person first."
3.0,Pretty but doesn't fit in arms as should
3.0,I am going to keep it. I did size up and was disappointed at first that is as short as it is in the front. I got it in black and like it with a longer black tank top under it to dress up jeans. Not bad for the price and a gold necklace?
3.0,"This was smaller than what I was looking for, but it’s still a nice ring. I will keep it because I love amethyst."
3.0,"did not like, fell off chains easy"
3.0,"Well worth the very inexpensive price.  One complaint is that it is quite difficult to set, both because of hard to understand directions and small size.  I wanted the small size, but fail to understrand why a company as large as Casio can not hire a few people that can communicate in English to write their manuals."
3.0,"I like it very slylish, but fabric is not durable."
3.0,"The quality is good and I like the little color strips on a black tank. Black is the best for workouts since light colors become see through because of sweat. I hate when that happens so I prefer black. But at the same time I do not want all the tanks to be in 1 color coz that just feels like you are wearing the same thing again and again(specially to people who see you often at the gym). I know thats a weird thing to bother about, but for  some reasons, that is why I bought these tanks in the first place since they are all black with colored lining.<br /><br />Another thing I like about them is they are very soft and made of sports fabrics like that of nike or any other popular brand. so the look and feel they bring is very classy.<br /><br />I just wish I had them in the right size since they were pretty expensive. I am gonna return them though and buy 1 size smaller ones<br /><br />I bought a medium size, and it still is large for my shoulder and arm area.<br /><br />If you wanna buy them I would suggest buy one size smaller than what you actually wear."
3.0,Lack luster.
3.0,The stone are so fake looking and it take from the design
3.0,Can't use it its not the right size.
3.0,The top fit nice but the skirt looked a bit cheap
3.0,"I ordered this dress for my Elle Woods costume. It came when it was expected, the dress looks exactly like the picture, and the fabric was great, but I am 5'6 and 140lbs. and a medium was just too big around the waist and in the bust. If it would have been offered in a small then it would have been perfect, but i had to return it."
3.0,The back and fabric
3.0,Nice but I guess you get what you pay for . I would buy again the material is a thinner than expected .
3.0,"I'm 5'11&#34;, 172lb with a lean, athletic build. I ordered a medium and was hoping for a nice slim fit; someone close to how a blazer should look. This coat was actually someone large. I have slightly long arms(always buy 34-35 sleeve dress shirts) and the sleeves rested just below my wrists. The length was about right. I have a 31.5&#34; waist and there was very little tapering in the body. The build quality seemed good overall but it felt like a regular, thick fabric jacket, except slightly more fitted."
3.0,"Not very well made. The posts bend way too easy when trying to latch into the back of the hoop. Once bent, it's near impossible to realign for proper connection."
3.0,"Very cute, real. But after a week of wearing my husband lost the pendant it was not very secure and he was sad it was so easily lost. If you want to wear this on special occasions it is perfect. Everyday wear on the other hand. Not so much."
3.0,They for too well. Too fitted for people with muscles.
3.0,"They seem very warm but the fit is very narrow and tight, and a bit long."
3.0,"Arrived late, and fit much smaller then the size it was supposed to be. However it is beautiful and I love it. Thank you!"
3.0,The fabric is pretty but the arm holes are too large. Keeps it from covering your chest.
3.0,Material is a bit scratchy for what I'd expect from lounge pants. Also the orange waistband is overly tight. There are definitely more comfortable lounge pants out there.
3.0,Very cute but does not last. Cheaply made and breaks easy.
3.0,"Worked great until I had to wash it, then it shrunk and doesn’t fit good anymore. But for the price it worked great until it got covered in mud."
3.0,They sent me the wrong size at first but after reading my review sent me another one which which actually for though it does not hang baggy as the model on the picture it's still a bit snug around the hips ... it's still a cute jumper and I got compliments but I wish it was baggy
3.0,The length isn't very great nor does it have the best quality. Gets the job done.
3.0,Se puede usar solo en cabello corto
3.0,Small and compact
3.0,Material is really thin. Bra shoes though
3.0,"Disclaimer, I haven’t actually tried it on just want to note don’t expect this to be safe for indoor exercises, really only good for outdoor exercising where you want to have a little added protection for yourself and keep others safe that are passing by, it’s probably great for that, so 3 stars?<br /><br />It has an air vent below which will make breathing much easier and add comfort but it’s basically a hole in the mask. I purchased by accident not realizing this until it was too late, and returned it before I even wore it/ unpacked it."
3.0,"It's  pretty, but it's not loose fitting and it's to thin and you would need to wear something under it. Just not for me,"
3.0,Just a little tight width wise
3.0,"Received this band yesterday the quality is average, just good, no complaints there. however I have small wrists and this band is WAY TOO LONG! For that reason I will not buy this brand again."
3.0,Does not seem to work on my Pandora bracelet  :(
3.0,Good for price but they loose color really fast
3.0,My suggestion would be for you to order up one size
3.0,Tooooo short in the Front!
3.0,"So cute, but Mines turned color pretty fast.  Maybe some cleaner will help."
3.0,"Initial hat was defective, replacement is great."
3.0,"Very nice colors. The only problem is that the magnet is not strong enough to hold keys and a name badge. If you only need one or the other, you'll be fine and like this product."
3.0,These are very pretty but also very heavy. I can't wear them nor can my 2 daughters due to the weight. Took about 3 weeks to receive
3.0,"Bought this bag because I fly Frontier so much.  It seems pretty durable, but the zipper is a little sticky.  Will easily hold a weekend's worth of clothes."
3.0,Very nice but it needs a new clasp as the original  one is too difficult to work.
3.0,The product was subpar. I opened up the package to find a small hole in one pair and threads hanging from others. I’ll be shocked if they last very long.
3.0,The cups are huge for people with a smaller chest. The materials is perfection though. Just doesn’t fit right if you aren’t large chested.
3.0,"OK first off, its $2. So do I need to say more. If you have any expectation of anything other than running then you will be let down. ITS $2!!!! It is not a true chronograph. They are just glued on. It is comfortable, and the band is remarkably soft and comfortable. its quartz its cheap. So enough said."
3.0,"It’s well stitched. Quality is good but the fabric is too thick. Even with the AC on, I got too warm. It’s for winter time. I got a small size and it was roomy and a bit too big for me but if you want a lose fitting, super roomy pj set this is for you. The color black is a proper deep black"
3.0,"I think it would be helpful if we knew the size, height of models since they are modeling it. I wear a medium and bought a medium. It’s super cute but not on me."
3.0,The dress is adorable. I wear a size 14 so I ordered an XL. The dress is too small so I had to send it back.
3.0,Quality was less than I expected.  I wore it and lost 2 of the head feathers from the light wind that blows in Southern California.  I will buy something better quality next time.
3.0,"The color is so off it looks awful. I'm not sure if I just got a bad band since others have said it matches but it didn't match my series 5 at all.  I didn't like it for that reason but otherwise, it's a nice band it fits and feels good. The color match is just a deal-breaker for me so it's going back."
3.0,"Did not like the material, the area where a bit tight to body gets kind of see through and not looking good."
3.0,up a size. runs small
3.0,"I have been looking for a sweater like this one for a while and I figured, why not? It took about a month to arrive and since I was going for more of the &#34;slouchy&#34; look, I went up one size. I am glad I did but also thinking if the fit would look more similar to the picture if I ordered my normal size.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. the material is very soft and the color I ordered (beige) was nice.<br /><br />2. With me ordering an XL (I am 5' 4&#34;, 141 lbs), i did accomplish the baggy/slouchy look.<br /><br />3. For the price, it really is not bad for this sweater.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. it did take a while to arrive (but that is understandable with it originating in China).<br /><br />2. Where I lean towards the other side regarding going up a size, I am glad I did because the large would have been really tight in the shoulder area.<br /><br />3. It does not fit the same in that area in the shoulders, and as a matter of fact, the look does look a little different than the picture.<br /><br />I really can't recommend to order your size or go up one because it really depends on your individual shape, but, if you are looking for a really baggy look, I would say it would be safe going up just one size."
3.0,"The product is decent material and all but I don't know who decided this is a size small. I'm a pretty average build, my thighs aren't exactly tone. Yet I'd have to gain a good 50+ pounds to be able to wear this thing. It's huge!"
3.0,"Nice, but the rose gold does not 'show off' the attractive crystal."
3.0,"It would be nice if they posted a picture of these next to an US quarter to give you an idea of size. I thought these would be dainty and elegant, but instead they were huge and more like costume jewelry.  The ear posts are ticket than your normal size, so if your ears are sensitive or if you have small piercings, these will be harder to put in and wear. They are also much heavier than anticipated due to the large size. A picture of a mannequin wearing these would help in understanding the size of them. In total I spent $11, so I gave them to a friend who was bigger and they looked great on her. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"This is a pretty dress, but it run small in the sleeves.  I would order a size up."
3.0,"This is a good top but because it is one-size, I had to get it altered and I put some hooks on the back. It is good for the price, but you might want to consider altering it if you are a skinyyyy gorl like me:)"
3.0,Charms missing!!!! Only received 98 charms.<br />Also have a weird smell to them!<br />The designs are okay. It’s a couple in here that I don’t understand what they are but<br />I can use the other ones. I just didn’t like the fact it’s missing charms. In which I read in all the other reviews. That’s not acceptable or professional.
3.0,"I like it , and I ware. thank you."
3.0,Was excited to get these shoes but disappointed when I saw them. From the picture they appeared to have a thicker sole and a little more substance to them. I will keep them even though they aren’t what I was expecting; still kind of cute.
3.0,"My husband has been wanting to find a swimsuit that dries quickly. Preferably almost immediately. This is not that suit. It doesn't dry any faster than his other swimsuits. It also was too tight, though he did wear it last night in the hot tub. He's a size medium 34. I was aware of the sizing issues and ordered him the XL. Unfortunately it wasn't a good fit. The color is great though and so was the length. We'll keep trying to find the super quick dry suit."
3.0,My GF wore this only 4 times & seams came a part. Hole in leg because of that
3.0,The string is too small and no open hook. It is impossible to wear. The bead is so so. I give 3 star because the design look nice.
3.0,The handle is a bit awkward
3.0,Great pice to small for what she wanted
3.0,Roomy but the material is a little stiff. Hoping they soften up with some washes otherwise won’t be comfortable to sleep in.
3.0,Not great quality; there are some fairly visible flaws. They are a gift and I don't have time to replace them.
3.0,It's not as elaborate in detail as it appears on the website.
3.0,I had to buy the next size up for my baby. The sizes are too broad and run more on the small side
3.0,"Looking for a cool rough- out boot, so had to return these- the toe box was kinda clunky looking and bigger/ taller than expected.<br />Also, they run big, so I had to send ‘em back anyways. Bummer ATF doesn’t have ‘em in stock!"
3.0,Rund small but nice dress
3.0,Fit great around but was WAY too long. I’m 5’2 and they were about 2 1/2 inches too long.
3.0,"Perfect for what I needed them for, but even with insoles, these were pretty uncomfortable to wear for a long time."
3.0,"First off I’ll say I like the jacket but it runs small, the fabric is rough and there was a weird smell when I opened it. That being said it’s okay, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.<br />I wear this to the gym normally.<br />I’m 5’5”, 173 lbs."
3.0,"Wore this 4-5 times but then the chain broke :( Might be able to fix it with tweezers, but I was disappointed at how quickly it broke."
3.0,"It came at the expected time, looks great and I love it but it scratches easily, and after about one week of using it, the clamp for the back stopped working and so the pin keeps falling off."
3.0,These pieces are HUGE. They touch my sholders when I wear them and are kinda scratchy. They were cheap though.
3.0,Nothing different than some of the other facemask. Material is think for summer use.
3.0,"I ordered 2 different masks that were labeled as being singer's masks so that I could compare them.  This one had the better price, and was very comfortable, but I also noted that the sound was considerably more muffled than the sound through the more expensive mask.  The other mask that I ordered was just as comfortable, but had considerably more mid and high range sound - and since most of your diction happens in the high frequencies, I judged that the other mask was worth the additional cost.  I won't be using this mask, except as a backup.  In addition, this mask took several days longer to arrive."
3.0,"these are cheaply made and everytime i wore them, id lose more ""stones"". but they were inexpensive and cute"
3.0,These are very pretty but small.
3.0,Great staff
3.0,"Didn't care for the material,  also ordered 2 black was very tight around neck and fit small,green was perfect ..supposed to be the same size."
3.0,It’s extremely small
3.0,"Very soft which is why I'm giving it the three stars and is beautiful, but my typical small size was pretty big and the knot in the front seemed to fall in an awkward spot. Returned it!"
3.0,"The dress is really pretty and comfy. However, the material is very thin. I had to wear a tank top and short tights underneath."
3.0,it was to large to wear but still it was the thought that counts would be nice to have a smaller size to choose from
3.0,It is fine!
3.0,"This watch pays homage to a Rolex, roughly approximating the brand's general appearance, right down to a crown-like logo on top of the watch face. However, I almost wish it didn't.<br /><br />The watch band feels like a chrome-covered plastic (not sure what it is), and has the kind of shimmering gold color you'd find on kids' toys, not gold watches.<br /><br />It's definitely noticeable up close, but I'm on the fence on whether or not it's extremely noticeable to others standing somewhat close.<br /><br />It's also bad enough quality that I would only let it peek through a dress shirt sleeve and not rock where it's out in the open.<br /><br />As such, I think it's an okay fashion accessory to add a partially hidden little detail, but if I had to do it over, I'd probably just buy a cheaper known-brand watch to pull of the style rather than opting for this."
3.0,"Thin t-shirt fabric .I bought it in a larger size, so it does not have the fullness that appears in the picture shown. Best suited for lounging."
3.0,"Cute design and comfortable but it’s not terry, it’s microfiber so everything sticks to it and it doesn’t get clean"
3.0,"Bought a bunch to give away, many have broken within less than a month."
3.0,Beautiful and I would have kept them if the prong was glued in correctly. I’m usually good at fixing things but it wasn’t something I could do without damaging the earring.
3.0,Love this but soccer ball fell off
3.0,"I ordered red, recieved a red with white trim. Meh love the shirt except shows a lot of cleavage."
3.0,Bigger than I thought but nice!
3.0,5'6 160 pounds 36c got a xl and had to return the boob part fit awkward but the material and color is good<br />Would look better on a petite body<br /> I feel It's not made for curvy girl it made me look wider
3.0,Fits too tight on the shoulders.
3.0,No le sirvió al reloj.
3.0,"Okay for working out at home, but they sure are small and tight. I wouldn't wear them on the street on in a public gym."
3.0,"I wasn't happy with the quality of the material, or to be more specific, the thickness of the material (pleather?). The toe box wasn't wide enough and there wasn't a 12w available at time of ordering."
3.0,The clover is more pink than purple.
3.0,Nice. I gave to my 5 yr old daughter. Back always spins to the front.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:edf51441aeafcc74582e4bd98dacd4bb]] These are nice silver charms. A bit too many larger ones than I was needing but I can find a use for them.  Good variety. A couple duds but sound nice make a jingle sound and are shiny and cast well come with cleaning cloth and good packaging. Good amount
3.0,"this is polarized however, now there is a chip in the lense that bothers me when i wear it"
3.0,20% didn't work.
3.0,My daughter loved these but they only lasted a few weeks before the toe broke on them.
3.0,Had to cut and sow back together. Very very loose
3.0,wish it wasn't all connected
3.0,"Fabric is too heavy I really thought this was thin, it’s very heavy fabric like the one they used for chairs it’s very heavy. The velvet they used is for either chairs and blankets."
3.0,"kind of fits my head weird, but i really love the hat"
3.0,"Was hoping these were stretchier, felt very snug.I am returning because I think I would end up removing due to the way they work it enough give"
3.0,"Like the design and pattern and fabric, but it was not true to size was more like a medium than an extra large"
3.0,a lot of variety but I wont use 99% of these.
3.0,"These shoes are beautiful, but even on the tightest notch, they are loose on my feet... and I don't have small feet.  I like them and I can still wear them, but the flop around a little and I have to be careful when I walk."
3.0,the face is perfect it the cloth is to thin on Halloween i expect a cold if not frozen man. pants do not come with suite. and will have to wear a tee shirt underneath
3.0,I LOVE this Jersey but when it arrive there was a yellow stain on the front of it.  It's a Christmas present and  Had to order a new one hoping it won't be stained.
3.0,"It's beautiful and it recieves lots of compliments.  The only trouble is the wires are a bit finicky and get snagged on stuff easily.  I fixed this with some pliers, I just bent the wires that stuck out in, and now it's lovely."
3.0,Bought these and they ended up being a lot smaller than I thought they would be. They're comfy but I probably will just use them to sleep in instead of at the gym.
3.0,Item was damaged but i like it.<br />It wasnt as strong as i expected but its cute.
3.0,La tela es de baja calidad. Y muy transparente
3.0,"The socks are OK. I didn't find them to be any easier to put on than any other compression socks I own. They are nice once on, except the top digs in to my calf a little."
3.0,These would be pretty awesome if it weren't for that dumb stitching that makes the bottom of the pouch look funny.
3.0,I really love this too but I'm only 4'9&#34; and it's too short for a dress too long for a shirt. Great quality though.
3.0,material a little thin but its ok
3.0,Bigger than expected and very heavy.
3.0,I thought this hat would be bigger. The fit is strange and looks weird on me.
3.0,Tarnished a bit and I have only had them for a few weeks. not delicate looking like the picture.
3.0,Nice looking bag from a distance except I did not like the decorative buckles on front.
3.0,"I really needed one that was sized  in small, but it looks ok."
3.0,"The fabric is okay but the fit is weird. Across the shoulders it’s very large which I was expecting. However, at the hips it tapers down and is tight. You also have to use it as a beach cover up or wear an undershirt if you plan on raising your arms because the sleeves open all the way to your waist."
3.0,Would probably look better on a taller thinner person.
3.0,"5'4, 150, C cup<br />Definitely runs small, I got a Large (usually get a medium) and it is fitting.<br />I really want to like this shirt, but I find the collar weird. It sticks up high around the shoulders and the fabric is stiff. It is also super itchy! I'm not sure if I want to try washing it or send it back."
3.0,They were a little smaller than I expected in fit. But they aren’t see through and very comfortable.
3.0,They work good for few days and one shoes Led light stop working I recharge and nothing no lights so I'm going to returned and re order another pair kids love it and people out there they ask where do they buy it they like it they interested and buy I recoment amazon good buy
3.0,Very long. Very light material.
3.0,"Dress was Nice, waistline was a little off and fabric was shiny and stretchy. I returned it because it was not a good look for me."
3.0,Good jacket but runs a size small.
3.0,Too small but super cute so I regifted to a friend who LOVES them.
3.0,Warm and comfy Halloween costume. My only isssue with it is that I could not get the hood to sit right. You could not tell what the costume was because the hood wouldn’t stay up and when it did you couldn’t see the design.
3.0,I got these for my 13 yr old and they turned her fingers green and broke very quickly. Paint the inside with clear nail polish and don't adjust them. Some are very small too.
3.0,The dress was cute but the headband was broken when opened as a gift!
3.0,See throu
3.0,"Recd these yesterday,  they look great but I usually wear size medium ordered large and they are too small the waist fits but the leg is very tight not very comfortable for running shorts."
3.0,this is very cute necklace! i used it twice and its already turning black. it is kinda short but does expanded a bit but not much. its well made beside the discoloring. the elephants are smaller then i thought but still is kinda noticeable. this would be good for kids not really for an adult. beside the discoloring overall its not bad. got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,The problem with buying watches on the internet is that (sometimes) things look different in person. This watch is one of those cases. In the single picture the watch looks great. In person the colors don't quite work together. The watch would look much better with a black strap. Asd far as the watch itself goes it's just fine - everything works as promised.<br /><br />- Oh well at least I didn't pay much at all for it. It'll be a good back-up watch.
3.0,"Great dress, color is WAY off from what is advertised.  I ordered the Petrol, king of a teal green.  What showed up was a very bright aqua blue."
3.0,"Very cute and colorful... I bought the gray color and so loved it so, I decided to order one in Orange same size a medium... oddly enough the color was red and the medium was a little snugged... For the price it was worth it😋"
3.0,The shoe was gorgeous  ! But being  a round toe shoe it made the shoe a little  small  and uncomfortable.
3.0,"its nicely made, but the sleeves are very disproportionate to the torso, way too bug and baggy which is disappointing"
3.0,"Although this is a nice ring, it did not come as pictured. I ordered the black version because I liked how it looked with purple stones around the square, black top. The stones are in reality black like the top of the ring, making it decidedly less descriptive. Disappointing!"
3.0,I like the multiple sizes of the cubes. But I have used the cubes twice since I purchased them. However the second time the netting tore at the seam. The netting allows you to see what is in the cube and that is important but it is the weak spot.. The cubes are too expensive to use once or twice and throw away..
3.0,the size is larger than the regular size
3.0,DID NOT LIKE GAVE IT AWAY
3.0,"I like the design but the measurements for the opening is gonna ride on the tight side, unless you are a kid-teenager. The sound bar works which is nice just need to be careful with the cable tether, That's the only real issue is the size of the helmet does ride on the small-medium size. The opening measures 5 3/4 in x 9 in and the depth inside of the helmet goes to 7 in. The remote is on the cable tether, be careful to pull to much may end up damaging the connection to the LEDs for power/sound control."
3.0,the overall shoe was of acceptable quality but the sizing ran far too small.<br />Ended up not being any value for me..
3.0,The lace was very tight and the rest of the material was stiff. I felt like I looked like I was wearing a big blueberry!
3.0,"Bought this Burei watch for my wife for her birthday. She loved the watch at first sight. We both have Burei watches and for the price, I believe is a good buy."
3.0,La blusa me llegó con un modelo diferente sin embargo lo voy a pedir nuevamente por q es muy bonito ojala me llegue el modelo de la blusa q es
3.0,Love the dress but the sizes run small so I re-ordered a size up. I'm a medium and hopefully the large will fit I'm still waiting to receive the large
3.0,"Show actual size (diameter) of the necklace on the screen, so we can see how small the item really is!  I don't have a working knowledge of the metric system and am led, self-led into thinking that it is more like the size shown on the screen."
3.0,"Fit as expected. Only wore them a few times and the grey pair tore at the inside thigh. Black pair dont seem to want to stay down on my calf, keep rolling up to my knees :/"
3.0,"Cute romper, the edges of the top don’t like to stay up, it comes with clear straps but I decided to go without them. I’m 5’5” 125lbs and got a small, it was still a bit big so I had it taken in on the sides."
3.0,These shoes are super comfortable and are actually cute (coffee snake) but like other reviewers have shared the top strap by the ankle does protrude too far from your foot and does not look normal. I wish this entire strap elasticized for a more custom fit. They have a piece of elastic at the corner of the strap but the overall strap length is already to large so does not work as intended. I may keep to wear around the house because they are super supportive (and comfy) but probably not out in public due to odd look of top strap. As far as size I ordered my usual 8.5 and it fit great in length and width / footbed etc... just that darn top strap.  :)
3.0,Doesn't lift and support like I thought it would. Disappointed. The bra is comfortable though.
3.0,"The length, width, and material are what I was looking for and works great with my pendants. The clasp, though, is a problem. I struggle with getting it open. You have to press and pull, and it twists while you're doing that. When it's closed, though, it's very secure."
3.0,"Big and bold design,  somewhat heavy feeling when worn. VERY brittle, handle with care!"
3.0,Quality and appearance is not as good as the online pictures
3.0,"states women socks but looks like girls socks and barely above the ankle, do not buy if like crew socks these are low ankle socks"
3.0,Pretty dress but it did not fit me well
3.0,"This item was very attractive, however, I had to return it because it was NOT 18 gauge."
3.0,"Loved the style but really hard to put on and the bottoms seemed way too smalll, even if the top felt fine."
3.0,"Not a real cycling jersey. My son loves the flash, so the shirt is what he expected. No pockets. It is really a regular shirt."
3.0,Product runs 2 sizes too small.
3.0,Bag was nice but the hardware was not.  It was missing a screw and if I had  not examined the bag closely I would not have never noticed. You cannot use the straps if the metal buckle fell off or broke.  Sent it back.
3.0,This is a decent product and my wife really liked it so she kept it even after finding a walmart tag with a $20 price tag on it.  Turns out walmart closed these things out at $10 and they're now selling for $50 here.  Great product at $20 but just ok when you have to pay over twice face value to get one.
3.0,Not as nice as the picture.  Cheap.
3.0,"The belt is cute and fits my daughter, however I ordered white and the belt is not white it is very much ivory and does not go with the white dress I bought it for."
3.0,"I would’ve given 5 stars, but it literally took me a very frustrating 45 mins to get it to finally blow up like its supposed to! I even held my hands around her ankles thinking air was escaping, it didn’t work! I took apart and re angled the fan several different ways. My last attempt at making this blow up on my disappointed tiny human finally worked!!!! U have to put pony tail holders around the ankles, over the costume ankle part!!!"
3.0,"They are nice glasses but the color of the lenses in person are a totally different then in the photo, they are green lenses not purple"
3.0,"SO CUTE, BUT DOES NOT FIT AS EXPECTED"
3.0,"They are cute, but the little jewels are digging into the roof of my mouth"
3.0,"I realize this is made by Spanx and expected a firm fit but it was much smaller than I would have liked.  It almost feels like a corset and I definitely cannot sleep in it as I had planned.  I recommend ordering up at least one, possibly two, sizes."
3.0,"Nice quality shirt, runs small order size up"
3.0,"The material is much heavier than I expected. However, it can be worn in early Spring when the days are cooler."
3.0,I basically live in flip flops around the house and even while during errands or casual dining.  These fit well but can get deformed when left in strong/hot sunlight over time.  I think at the price point they are fine if you are not expecting longevity or making a fashion statement.  I only use these around the house.  My teenage boys and I share these as needed while doing chores outside.
3.0,don't like the material.
3.0,"I am a medium and I got this on the correct size.<br /><br />I tried to put this thing on I could not.<br /><br />IT is so much smaller than regular size that it was nearly impossible to put it on, to the point that I gave up and hav not tried ever since.<br /><br />I will try again later but all I can say for now is this:<br /><br />- good fabric item, it is well made and has a cute style and design<br /><br />- it is way too small so a size or two up is best.<br /><br />I hope I manage to get this thing on one day but for now it will rest."
3.0,"I’m 5’1 and 115 pounds and the small is huge on me. Nevertheless, the sweater is super comfy and cozy."
3.0,"Just ok, nothing special. Not worth the price, returned"
3.0,Was not a true beige. Looks more yellow
3.0,Unfortunately it did not fit.
3.0,The design is nice but fit was too tight and short for me. 5'9 with curves.  Wish it would've fit loose as pictured.  I ended up giving it away to someone shorter and not as top heavy and it fit them good.
3.0,"I expected this to be super pretty because of the picture, but the coloring is pretty different. I expected it to be a little long so it fits like I expected. I just bought my normal size. It is still cute, but its not as cute as I had hoped."
3.0,"My daughter really liked these. With that being said, they cracked and looked bad soon after purchase."
3.0,Way too orange.
3.0,Cheaply Made!!!
3.0,material would be appropriate for summer definitely should keep you comfortable with hot days/nights..
3.0,Was disappointed. Pictures made this mask look sparkly. That’s what I wanted.
3.0,It’s alittle tight in the hips<br />But overall very nice
3.0,"Nice blouse, but fits weird, definitely narrow across the shoulders and chest."
3.0,"Unfortunately fit is very unflattering if you are on the short side, even with leggings."
3.0,It fits great but it is sheer. You can see right threw the pants. It is very comfortable but the type of fabric used traps heat so not somthing to wear if its really hot out.
3.0,Thank God that it stretches a little bit other than that it would have been too small for me 😫 i like it though!
3.0,Band will not go small enough for my wrist
3.0,"Had a lot of cash on my rewards card, so I ordered 3 of these. I wanted dresses that I could toss on over my bathing suit, then just pull off before a dip in the pool. I won't mind wearing it around the house. They work fine for that. Also, if I ever get to go to the beach again, they'll be good for that. However, I would not wear this as a going-out dress. It is flimsy and kind of cheap-looking. As a swimsuit cover-up, it's great.<br /><br />Also, runs large. I am normally a medium in better-quality dresses, but I ordered small in these. The medium would have been too baggy on me.<br /><br />For my purposes, it works fine. For getting a bit dressed up to go out to dinner (again, some day, when I can do that again) . . . no."
3.0,The fit is good but just screen printed logo not a stitched patch disappointed
3.0,"This is green, but nut not the green in picture. It does run a little tighter than expected.."
3.0,"Just as I expected, however very tight between the toes."
3.0,Definitely a beginner item. Leather is soft. Comfortable fit though.
3.0,"As an adult, I like to dress age appropriate and this was too revealing. The legs are high cut and the back is pretty cheeky. Also, it's very low rise, front and back. Not so nothing that I would wear around family or at a kids park. The bikini bottom is not a true fold over, it just looks like a bikini that is folded over. On me, the thick waistband appears bumpy and stands out under a tight tankini top. The material is good, and it washes well. It’s TTS, I wear a size 10, 145#, 5’6”, and the size large fit me.<br /><br />I can’t bring myself to post a picture in these bikini bottoms ;-)"
3.0,"The material is somewhat rigid making it a bit of an awkward fit, doesn’t like to stay put in the retaining bands"
3.0,Wasn't as form fitted as expected. I should have downsized one size.
3.0,"Very cute, glitter doesn’t flake off easily.  The buckle however is very flimsy (made of very thin fabric) and fell apart after one wearing.  They run a tiny bit on the large side but with the straps that shouldn’t be too much of an issue if you’re ordering up a tiny bit.  This would have been a perfect review if the buckle was all metal."
3.0,"The waste band is quite irritating, but if you fold it over it's not as bad."
3.0,"I loved the earrings, and I like to wear them when I go to the beach to match my Bikinis.<br />But the studs aren't very good, and they don't hold the earrings.<br />I had to adapt and use the studs from other earrings."
3.0,"The sigil on this hat is very heavy, it weighs the hat down. And it isn’t very fitted, which I thought it was. Definitely keeps your head warm tho!"
3.0,The slit in the back mostly makes it look unflattering in all photos taken while wearing it. Would rather have a solid shirt. No slit in the back. Doesn’t help.
3.0,These are not the quick detach bands. Tools (included) are required to swap bands.
3.0,It's hard to comfortably secure on the ear.
3.0,"I have rhode islands, cinnamon queens, and Easter eggers. I have to put knots in the straps to get them to “fit”.  And they still do not fit right.  A couple spin sideways and will not stay centered."
3.0,Nice sweater but has a mildew smell
3.0,The only problem is the swimsuit died not have a string at the waist to tie.  So when I swim laps it loss end and comes down.  I assumed it would have a tie string.
3.0,"A little bit of an awkward fit, but it is pretty cute!"
3.0,Jersey material pilled making it look old just after 3 washings.
3.0,"I like cotton because it's healthier, but they do ride up."
3.0,"It's ok i guess, it has that cheap feel cause it's got that cheap price duhh! Oh and it looks great...not bad at all"
3.0,I like that this mask is stylish & comfortable. But it runs large & rips easily. Not quality made
3.0,There is not much fabric to hold these in place.
3.0,Its a nice quality hat but the print on it was much smaller that the picture showed. The print was probably 2/3 the size of the picture
3.0,"Nice wallet but not exactly what I expected. The wallet is indeed black with silver hardware as seen in the picture. However, the wallet has a gold logo stamp of the brand name on the flap of the wallet. Based on the photos I was under the impression I would receive a solid black wallet with silver hardware. I an considering sending this item back."
3.0,Tiny ear rings
3.0,I really liked these and could give a higher rating but the post was kinda big and kept falling out on the studs - I don’t use the hoops . But product was definitely worth the money..
3.0,"This top in a large was a bit baggy and too long. I am 5'7&#34;, 170 pounds, and ordered a large. I think medium would have been a better fit. However the fabric is a bit flimsy, and I am going to return it."
3.0,After a month and a half the thread on the foot is coming off
3.0,"Too long of a shirt, goes to thigh area and I ordered an XXL based on others reviews but should have gotten an XL."
3.0,"I am a M/L US size, I ordered 2XL and they are still to small.<br />Please send 3XL."
3.0,This hat runs small and is too tight. Otherwise it seems to be made well.
3.0,The flower is actually very yellow compared to pictures.. I wasn't too happy with the product but oh well. I gave it as a re gift so...
3.0,"It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but serves it's purpose to store enough toiletries for getting away for one or two days."
3.0,didn't fit my glasses as well as i expected.
3.0,Best watch band I have ever owned ....
3.0,The fabric is very good and soft，but the size is too big for my husband. I have returned and buy another one.
3.0,Dress runs a bit bigger than actual size. I also didn’t like that the front part isn’t sowed. There was a material that can be flipped around making the front display weird.<br />Dress looks great other than that BUT do wear nude spandex or undergarment as it’s see thru.
3.0,I bought these for my 4 year old. His ears dont fit right inside the earphones. The band doesnt expand either. They are very small. They will work for now since we need them for an event coming up otherwise I would probably return.
3.0,it didnt last 2 months very disappointed
3.0,The dress was beautiful and great quality for the price . However I am pretty hippy so the dress ended up being to tight around the hips but way to loose on the top so I had to return it. I knew that was a possibility as my measurement do not quite match the measurements provided as my waist and upper body is a lot smaller then my bottom half.
3.0,"I love the look of the boot, but they were about 2 sizes too big."
3.0,"I got the size 20-22 and my boobs are not staying put. I have a 42C - thankfully this can be fixed with a fitted tank.<br />  Love the color cut and pattern tho.<br /> For more info I'm 5'11, 280lbs and hourglass shaped."
3.0,The ties arrived on time. One of the ties has a pull in it. See photo. I bought these for a special event tomorrow. I will return the damaged one on Sunday.
3.0,"I got these boots for my daughter and she loves them. Super soft and comfy. HOWEVER, they are not snow boots... her feet were totally soaked and frozen... these would be fine if not walking in the snow or sleet. After they dry she will still use them for winter wear that doesn’t involve walking in snow."
3.0,"Always used Sockwell but decided to try these because of the price point. There's no comparison in the quality, will definitely spend the extra money for better quality socks in the future."
3.0,"Wears great, and comfy, but let's face it, it isn't a long term purchase. Washed and I see pilling, I think I'll get a few months of summer and then replace it. But I did buy a few of them, think of it as a stylish T-shirt-for that it's great."
3.0,"I liked the fit. The high waist was nice, and it helped flatten a bit. I got. S/M (5’7”, 140 lbs) they weren’t compression types though. I felt really comfortable, but I got a run on my butt crack the first day I wore them. Today. Very disappointed since I really liked them. Color was nice too. I don’t think they can’t be fixed. Will be requesting a refund."
3.0,back pin is to long and stone leans foward so if you dont make the backing as tight as possible then the earing droops and looks kinda stupid
3.0,The top is more like a crop top and I ordered a large because I like pjs bigger and they fit like a medium. Like material and super comfortable though.
3.0,"Adorable bracelet, but too small. Not sure this bracelet would fit most women."
3.0,"I ordered these for my son to wear for graduation. He has always liked sponge bob. The description says it will fit size 13. Well it will fit, but the images look distorted and are very tight. I was very disappointed because we didn't try them ahead of time."
3.0,The bill is just a little large and stiff for my tastes.  Nice cap though.
3.0,I have used and loved  this wallet for years but was so disappointed with this new one.<br />The outside pocket is just the smallest bit smaller but the difference is just enough that<br />my credit card will no longer fit behind my unless crammed in.
3.0,Very cute. Runs small. Asian size
3.0,"I like the pijama, but had to take the time to sew the button holes in so the buttons didn't become loose at night.  Other than that, happy with the softness and size of the item."
3.0,It's a nice looking dress however the length isn't long enough for me....I kinda thought that's how it would go because I have yet to find one long enough for me....if you're tall at all don't bother....otherwise you should buy this!!!! Seems like a great quality dress perfect for a fall shower or special occasion!!!
3.0,Seems tight across the bust line
3.0,Not the size mentioned. I received a 6mm instead! I will be returning them
3.0,"its cute, but turns color."
3.0,"It seems to be decently made (I received one of the ones that was satiny with no stretch and zippered in the back) but it was actually a little big based on the sizing chart in the pictures. I think if it fit and it was more of a jersey knit I'd like it, but it doesn't fit or fall right on me so it's going back."
3.0,"The glasses are exactly as pictured, although they have a decidedly cheap feel to them. Appropriate for costume role-play and novelty effect. NOT for serious use as everyday prescription eyeglasses. They come in a very nice case and packaging, considering the price."
3.0,The socks are great with very breathable fabric however they keep coming off from the heal even with the special rubber lines it has
3.0,fit is great but the lens is not perfict a little wavy and distorted i got them to use for underwater photogtaphy and depending on where i look threw the lens i can see the image shift
3.0,"I like the design and quality of this case but only one thing wrong, The one snap keeps unsnapping. maybe I got a bad one."
3.0,"I am 5'6"" ordered an XL and this sweater went down to my knees, which may have been okay if the snaps didn't start at my waist. Oddly long. Great fabric and light weight sweater. Really wanted to love it. Returned and still looking for a light summer sweater."
3.0,Really cute but are very slick on the bottom. My 14 month old slips a lot when he wears them. So we just wear the socks with shoes
3.0,"The arms don't align perfectly with my shoulders but this sweater received a ton of compliments for its original and artsy design. It is warm, long enough to wear with leggings (I'm 5'8) and not itchy."
3.0,that's ok
3.0,"Description stated these pajamas were 100% cotton.  They weren’t.  Did not look at the tag closely until it was too late. Had already removed all the tags before I realized the fabric is 60% cotton, 40% rayon."
3.0,Very cute. Good length for me at 5'9 (size m). Just huge in the armpit. Good swim cover up.
3.0,Super cute but runs small. Medium fit more like a small. If you’re over 5’5 get a large or the pants won’t be long enough
3.0,"One of the socks ripped the second i took it out of the packaging. Not thrilled about it. The socks themselves are fine, slightly snug on my size 10 feet."
3.0,"They are pretty and have a good weight to them, so they do not look cheap. However, the section that slides into your ear is thicker than I'm used to and it's uncomfortable. Plus,I'm concerned that it will increase the size of my piercing."
3.0,"The costume looked great, but the eye mask was very small. It was way too tight on my son's (average sized!)  head and I had to alter it so he could wear it for Halloween."
3.0,"One of the socks keeps bunching up at the ankle and falling down. They are sized correctly, and it's only one of the two socks, but pretty ineffective at compression if it's around my ankle half the time. I'm a nurse and run around quite a bit, so I need something that will stay up."
3.0,Go up two sizes. Material stretches but it is like squishing a marshmallow through a straw. Pretty pattern though.
3.0,The fabric was amazing and the head part fit fine but the bottom part was too big. It says unisex but as a women it was too large and fell down.
3.0,Quality soso
3.0,Sleeves don't lay across the shoulders the way it looks on the model.  Instead of fitting over the top of the arm it slides the 'sleeve' slides over to the shoulder.
3.0,Fit was too large a materials felt low quality.
3.0,"Very overpriced, but I think it matches a pair of earrings, so wearable."
3.0,It’s slightly uncomfortable and see through but it’s cute.
3.0,"I ordered this shirt as a work shirt. It is more like a tight, going out shirt. The design is really cute."
3.0,"Zipper broke pretty quickly, otherwise alright"
3.0,"Very cheaply made. The closing mechanism has to be forced. Cant really slap it on. ""Plastic"" sheeth is also very cheap."
3.0,These pants are cut with less room in the seat than others I have of the same
3.0,This shirt was really small.  I normally wear a Medium and I got an XL and it was still a little snug around the chest.
3.0,Longer sleeves up towards under arm & to cover hands not just the thumb part
3.0,"for the price, i guess the cape/headband are fine. the material of the cape feels like what a child's cheap halloween costume are made out of. the headband is a little better quality, but if you aren't cosplaying asta that's useless to you. overall, it worked for my costume but i wish the cape would have been made of heavier material."
3.0,"Nice looking watch, looks more expensive than it actually is, but the quality is not that good.<br />The one i bought lost the second hand needle after roughly 2 weeks of use, it still works but the second hand its now bouncing inside the watch."
3.0,It was not comfortable and made my ear irritated within a day.
3.0,"I love the design of this top. However, it is too small in the shoulders and arms. It's as if they are not proportional at all."
3.0,Did not receive correct pattern.  Ordered floral and received argile.
3.0,I bought this for my wife. I am returning it because it is sized way too small. I ordered a women's medium but it looks more like an extra small.  Nice shirt otherwise.
3.0,"These jammies aren’t very comfortable, and the elastic in the waistband of the pants flips like a crocodile outta water. Slightly embarrassed I bought them as Christmas gifts for family members."
3.0,"Worked for what I needed dit for. Nott he greatest quality, but was ""good enough""."
3.0,Very cute but see through
3.0,Very nice earrings. My wife has gotten a lot of likes. Elegant look
3.0,"The embroidered mopar emblem is excellent, the hat material is not. It has a very flimsy cardboard insert that is totally worthless. The hat material is very thin , kind of like wearing a rag on your head. Sad to say this is a licensed Chrysler product. I will not be buying another one, hat that is."
3.0,The color isn't exactly red.  More of a hot pink.  The material wasn't exactly what I expected.
3.0,"shirts was little tight on me but I'm 62 years old and I'm carrying the food more around the middle now.<br />SOME PEOPLE CALL IT GETTING FAT, AND they are my friends!"
3.0,"Great hat, but putting your logo on it screams I have something in my hat.  It's like wearing a bunch of 5.11 gear that screams I am concealed carrying."
3.0,For what it is its ok.  Purchased one for the event as it was a quicky and wasnt sure if I would like wearing rings at all.  Wore it during the day only after 2 months stones started disappearing.  Ordered a 2nd one and one of the prongs was cut or not formed all the way so there's a gap in the prong. But for $20 the price is right. looks pretty on.
3.0,"Didnt like the fit for me, looks shapeless"
3.0,Fabric is thicker than expected and it doesn't look good if you have big breasts.
3.0,"Goes with my seatcovers and similar material. However my 15"" wheel is easy fit.. almost too easy. Rubber inside slid easily. After a few days it seems to have stuck better. A friend suggested I sew it on and this can be done easily if it continues to slide."
3.0,I only had the anklet for about one month and it broke and I was unable to repair it.  Poorly made.
3.0,"At $10 these are pretty decent sunglasses. My only problems with them is the hinges are too tight for the cheap frame around them and I have to be extra careful to not snap it in half upon opening, but I'm hoping it loosens up over time. Also the picture of the blue lens is quite misleading, upon opening the package I thought that they sent the black ones by mistake only to barely see a hint of blue in reflection, not at all close to the clearly defined blue shown in the pictures."
3.0,"I bought these because it was claimed they were manufactured in Korea.  But when I got them, thought they came from a company in Korea, the labeling attached to the socks indicated they were made in China, which is what I didn't want, so I was disappointed.  That said, I've worn one pair so far and they were comfortable but not as high of quality and as thick as my thickest furry socks I already had.  I'd definitely say the thread count is not as high.  I do like the length of them.  I hope this Korean company will employ those who live in their own country to manufacture them and improve the quality."
3.0,"I love this unique tunic with the two check patterns plus the wide elastic band. The down side is that the neck is small for someone with a short turkey neck so I'll have to keep two buttons open and try to tame the stiff collar to lay flat.  A selling point was that it was cotton/linen, which I think it is, although there is no tag on the garment regarding fabric or laundering. The back view is not very flattering as the top is big and then it tapers to a narrow bottom, much like an inverted cone. A bonus is that there are two pockets cleverly hidden in the border between the big and small check prints.<br />OH,OH!! Just found a flaw on the seam where the satin piping is not sewn correctly and the raw edge is exposed 8-9 inches on the bodice. I think I can undo the seam and resew it but make sure you really check your purchase."
3.0,"I love the fit, but wish it had a built in slip.  Extremely see through!"
3.0,It was disappointing that the watch came without a battery.
3.0,These did not fit how I expected and were much too small. Be sure to order a size up.
3.0,My necklace came and it looks tarnished. It says that you can wear them separately but they do not come separate. I thought they were longer. Very dainty & lightweight. Hope it holds up for more than a few wears!
3.0,I orderd 3. The pink one was a littlebeat shorter and smaller then the others
3.0,It’s was ok
3.0,The dress didn’t fit like size 1x. I ended up giving it away because it fit tight.
3.0,Runs small.  Pants are especially short.  Size up.
3.0,Very soft thin flannel material.
3.0,The material was not as thick as I expected.
3.0,It was too tight.
3.0,"The pants look really cute, but the fabric is really thin and the stitching feels unstable."
3.0,Don't expect to use them more then once. My son wore them on Halloween and they were rip on the bottom by the end of trick or treating. Also they are not very big. Don't expect to be able to wear shoes with them. I put them on a 4 year old. They did serve there purpose.
3.0,"I am usually a 9.5 and ordered a 10 because some reviews said these ran narrow.  That is true, but the 10 was too big for me.  I think a 9.5 would work just fine. However, I'm not reordering because I have some concerns about how the shoe looked/bent when I walked.  I think the leather looks like it will wrinkle funny- I have another pair of shoes that did that and they end up looking more worn and not smooth.  Without a zipper, it was a little difficult to get my foot in and out.  Plus, the 9.5 is way more expensive."
3.0,"These socks are definitely cute, but not very comfortable. They seem to be small for the size, but the fabric isn't great either."
3.0,Not as pretty in person as the picture. But good quality
3.0,The dark one fits tighter then the pink. When the straps are pulled the bra gaps under the arms. Tigger the pull the bigger the gap. Luckily I am only a B cup & this is not a huge issue.
3.0,Stitching was loose on the embroidery.
3.0,I have not worn the blouse. However it will be a nice blouse for spring.
3.0,"It's a very nice good quality sock.  Personally, I don't like it as much as my other Balega socks but that's just a preference thing.  These are certainly ultra light and maybe too light for my running comfort.."
3.0,ok but the length is a bit short I am 5'10&#34;. I have found others that fit great but forget where I got them.<br />My arms are slim so they work for me. If you are a bit heavy or muscular these will not fit.
3.0,A Little tight on the back of the shoulders.  I love the color and look otherwise.  Will buy the next size up if I purchase this top again.
3.0,The fabric is not elastic at all and the material gets a bit wrinkled. I guess it's pretty low quality even for the price.
3.0,For my daughter.
3.0,Material is extremely thin. Not the quality expected
3.0,One of the zippers ripped upon opening. Good for one trip but definitely not durable to last & last. Price reflects quality
3.0,"These are very nice looking with a good color combination.  Problem is that every time I try to fasten them, they get stuck in the buckle."
3.0,Cute dress but ran very very very small! I ordered the 3X and usually I wear a 1 or 2X and this was like a size 10!
3.0,"Be Aware that this top it absolutely gorgeous, however, it fits very small and snuggly. The shipping was quick and fast."
3.0,Ordered this for my daughters play at school and received only the wings.
3.0,Haven't been successful yet with the watch I bought them for but I'll keep trying.
3.0,"These do help keep the mask off you face a little bit.  BUT on a hot day, the plastic definitely feels a little warm against your skin and makes my face sweaty."
3.0,My problem is the gray lens.  They are too dark for me to use.  I would prefer  a gold or silver colored lens.
3.0,went up a size and needed to go up another. tight in chest. strap threading came undone when trying on. returning and trying out a size up in hopes it will fit the chest!
3.0,"I really love the bracelet.  It is not flimsy.  It is handy, but I don't think the hair ties will stay on if one were really active."
3.0,This looked so pretty on me however by the end of the night a rose fell off.
3.0,The leather in front had a defect
3.0,Small in the bust and shorter than on the model.  Very pretty though so I'm disappointed.
3.0,Small fit & even bought bigger
3.0,The gray pants fit great and for some reason the black pair does not. Both the same size.
3.0,I washed it before giving it as a present and the print got fuzzy/faded.
3.0,"The material is very thing and you can see the light of day through it.  Also, has a weird feeling to.  Shirt fits and looks just like the picture on."
3.0,"Product on site appears much better than in reality. It looks like the mask had a textured front and a nose wire. This mask does not have a nose wire and is quite big, the design is not textured but a plain print. The picture I took actually looks better than the mask under normal house lights. No way is it worth the price and if it wasn’t so tedious for me to do small returns, I wouldn’t hesitate to return and get my money back."
3.0,"I ordered two of these, one red, one blue. They are very soft and well made and large enough (I am size 18/20) The colors are so faded, the red was  a very faded pink and the blue was a washed out grey."
3.0,"Awkward fit for me. I have big quads because I lift. The waist fits, but it awkwardly squeezes my quads. They may be okay for someone who is smaller, but if you have a muscular build, prob not for you. But maybe it’s just me lol"
3.0,Run really small they are more for kids size
3.0,"Not  flattering , returned"
3.0,Well made but Im 5'3 and the torso is to small
3.0,It's a very pretty & comfy dress but it didn't fit. I think with maybe a large it would've been fine...MAYBE. I'm usually a medium so I'd size up. I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing but a lot said to buy true size ....NO go up a size. Just for reference: I'm 5'4 150lbs 36B. I had bought another one that fit just right so I'll just be returning for now. Maybe in the future I'll repurchase in right size.
3.0,The item is good quality and arrived on time. Very good!
3.0,Little smaller in length and bigger in size
3.0,These are cute earrings and look even better in person than in the picture. My only problem is they were shipped in a padded envelope and arrived with bent posts. I was able to bend them back into position but they’re still a little bent. These were a gift so I’m a little disappointed.
3.0,"A VERRRY shiny material. You can see every bump, wrinkle, lace, roll, whatever you got going on under it..youll see it. The black is ok, but youll HAVE to wear a tshirt bra underneath. I got the pink one too and i wont ever wear it.<br />The lace up doesnt come down that far either :("
3.0,Ita alittle cheaply made I expected the breast cups to be more shapely instead their just straight up flat and flatten your boobs. I mean this will work for what I need it for but I just expected better for the price.
3.0,It's a nice dress but when I took it out of the package it had a rip in it but I kept because I did like the dress and I needed it for an event.
3.0,"Cute, but too wrinkly. Not sure how one would get them out so returning."
3.0,"I like them when I wear them very well, they're very pretty. But I throw them up on my head a lot, and I can't keep them there for anything! They slide backward or fall off and that's not cool."
3.0,"I paid the extra money for these because the description says they're moisture wicking. After wearing them I think they're mislabeled, seems like a typical terry cloth to me and nothing on the tags mentions it being moisture wicking. Other than that, great casual pant."
3.0,The product was ok but 2 sizes small
3.0,The bottoms fit true to size but the top is ridiculously small. My tits are small for my body size but the top barely covers the damn things. The cups might fit an A or B cupped lady but that's about it.
3.0,These are so fun and cartoony but they're pretty hard to see out of unless it's super bright out! Lenses are a bit...murky.
3.0,"The bust was very tight.  I got the largest size available hoping it would not be tight at the hips, never thinking the bust would be tight. I have never experienced a bust so tight in that size... usually I am swimming in the top while tight at the bottom.  Beware!  I chose to return this dress right away and was pleased with the rapid refund.<br /><br />One other thing I did not  like about this dress was the material. Nothing on the label to say what it was made of either.  Said it was a denim dress but it felt like an acrylic material....not at all like a true cotton denim which I was led to expect in the description."
3.0,"Liked the pendant and size was nice, but the quality of the chain is poor."
3.0,Won't wear it until Oct '14.  I buy my next year's halloween costume right after this year's event is over.
3.0,"smaller than a dime,so smalll"
3.0,I was looking so forward to this item as I've been contemplating on it for a while.  When they arrived they couldn't wait to use them I'd went out and we did my vegetable garden the other day they're a little big they don't fit grade around the fingers with the claws and the gloves without the claws they ripped rather easily was is a down fall. I ordered them to help save my fingers from excess amount of dirt
3.0,The compression level of these socks is way too strong. They are not really easy on as the video describes. I’m hoping they will become more comfortable in the future.
3.0,"While the necklace looks so cute, I broke the second time I wore it."
3.0,Ordered for my daughter.  Clips are on the cheap side and have already broken. Less than one month.
3.0,Delivery could have been quicker. Item fit well.
3.0,"It's pretty, but very big. I ended up using it as an ankle bracelet."
3.0,"The band itself is really nice, however it slips off at least once or so everyday on my Versa 2. It appears the pin is not long enough to keep it in the holes so if you’re active and move your wrist around it will likely fall off."
3.0,"I brought this item for my nephew, it is nice but it came broken. I was not able to return the item. I would give it 5 start rating had it not come broken. Other than that issue, children will enjoy this Mickey Mouse umbrella"
3.0,They fit well and are comfortable but we have pulls after just a couple if washes.
3.0,The &#34;easy to follow clear instructions&#34; are in Mandarin.
3.0,Pink blouse has red thread on the buttons.
3.0,"Ok for price, different material than expected."
3.0,"I bought an XL because it said that it runs somewhat small, however, when it arrived it was just a little too big.  Great color though!"
3.0,Pretty. My bracelets catch on it. Wore it on Easter.<br /><br />No cami or tank top under-wear your own.
3.0,I love the softness of the shirt. It appeared wrinkled when arrived. Washed it and the wrinkles are still there. I’m not a fan of wrinkles. Cute shirt. Hope no one sees them like me.
3.0,ok quality but an inch shorter than advertised.
3.0,I love it but it is see thru
3.0,I ordered the red dress & the top of it looked orange. Doesn't look like the picture at all.
3.0,Ran very small. I purchased a 5t and it was more of a 3t after I washed it.
3.0,The quality of the shirt is good. I bought it for my granddaughter. Size ran small. I wanted to return it but I was told I couldn’t. So I kept it.
3.0,gold wore off
3.0,Very comfortable and easy to adjust. But it broke the second time I wore it with intense exercise.
3.0,The logo/bill are off-center. I can't tell if this is intentional or a production error. The crown of the har is also extremely high
3.0,Cute but the piece that goes between your toes really hurts.
3.0,"Not a fan of the fabric quality (very nylon/polyester-y), but it’s cute enough to wear as a layered look. It hits pretty short so be careful bending over."
3.0,"Previous review (still true) Perfect size for traveling.<br /><br />I have used this wallet about 4 times since I got it as I use it primarily for traveling with my passport. I realized what had been bugging me from the start is the layout.<br /><br />The picture of the red wallet above shows 10 card slots, that's what I expected, instead I got a layout more like the black or the purple wallet with only 6 card slots. Selected this wallet as it had the 10 slots.<br /><br />The wallet I received is more like the Zopen v4 wallet.  Still works but not what I had selected or wanted."
3.0,"Nice, for what we wanted."
3.0,"I have worn Bali for decades. The recipe has changed. The material is thinner, less stretchy and less likely to be as durable as the original material. So sad. What use to be a five star product is now only an average three star."
3.0,"The top is beautiful and very well made. Runs two sizes smaller, large is like a US small."
3.0,These were higher quality than expected when I took them out of the package. They slipped on and I thought they fit well. Then I saw my reflection. These are not for someone with cellulite ‘cause GURL it looked liked a vat of strawberry flavored cottage cheese. I haven’t seen this many bumps since I was at my OBGYNs office.
3.0,"I am a woman with an average size head- I really liked the way this hat looked, but it was way too big for my head and I had to return it.  Seemed like it would be very warm."
3.0,"I ordered these twice. Of the 12 I received, 2 were repeats. I gave 7 away to small children to play 'dress up' in because they were not attractive. There were 2 though that I really like and wear almost daily."
3.0,Jacket does not have “quilted” look like in the pictures. Came super wrinkly and cheap material.
3.0,Nice watch... But I found out what ampm24 ment .. It has to be wound every day... That's a pain in the neck..
3.0,"I do really like this, although the cross is a lot smaller than it looks on screen. If it was any larger it wouldn't have fit in my ear."
3.0,The top was very small and the bottom was very large and long.
3.0,"I dig the look and feel of these boots, but they're definitely not made to last. They feel like what you'd buy from Payless, back in the 90's. They're cute, but likely won't stand the test of time. It's not a deal breaker for me since they're for my teenage daughter, who will probably outgrow them - but if you're buying these, hoping they'll be a staple in your closet for many years to come, you may want to keep searching."
3.0,"I ordered up based on the reviews I was reading and it still fit me a little small. Very snug not flowy like I was hoping. Also I know it is white, and it might be that it is snug on me, but it was super thin and see through. I'm hoping it will fit much better after loosing some baby weight! I'm 7 months prego (yes I know this is not a maternity shirt) but I don't have much of a baby bump. I'm 5,5 and weigh about 230 with a 40 DD chest. Hope this helps someone!"
3.0,I needed a charm with a single loop for a necklace. The item is pictured with a single loop. I received charms with dual loops. That’s is not what is pictured nor what I needed.
3.0,"I got for my beach trip as just to liven things up, and was great for just that. Its not made out of the best material, very stiff."
3.0,They were supposed to be wide width but didn't fit.
3.0,This mask has great workmanship it is a ribbon tie. Although this mask I believe would fit a child better than an adult. I ordered five masks at the same time different types different styles this mask was very very narrow
3.0,"Cute, but not as expected. I ordered burgundy, they look brown. I have a sit down job, not on my feet too much, by the end of the shift I want to rip them off."
3.0,I thinks it is plastic.
3.0,Nice piece just a little too big
3.0,"I'd like to give this band more stars, but it is not well-made. It has started to show substantial wear after just a few months. I switch out my bands a lot, and this one gets worn only 1-2 times per week, so I would have expected it to stay looking nice for a while. It does look good, though, and I've gotten compliments from girlfriends, so giving it three stars. I wouldn't mind paying a little more if the quality was higher..."
3.0,"This suit is not for the big chested. I loved the suit and it fit great, except for the lack of support up top. Unfortunately had to send it back - for reference I’m a 34D."
3.0,I thought they would be heavier weight.but kinda dainty bite cute. would be cool for kids in school who think they're in life..lol
3.0,Need to order up a size
3.0,Have to order a size larger than normal. Sizing is different
3.0,Nice material but the belt is too high up. The size is correct but the placement of the belt loops are not! Otherwise very comfy.
3.0,Back/ stem came off the first time I wore them. Cheap cheap.
3.0,"These are super cute but 2 things: One of the straps are a little loose than the other. I noticed my niece’s foot slipping off due to the loose strap. Two, My niece slipped on them due to slick bottom the first time she put them on."
3.0,Very durability
3.0,"Bought two of these and was really disappointed. This would've been so cute had it A. reached the ankles and B. wasn't made of stiff, cheap material."
3.0,It was not what expected. But it will probably work.
3.0,"he tee shirt was smaller and flimsier that I expected. I wanted something soft, not clingy. This doesn't measure up."
3.0,I love it but it very big in size for me
3.0,"I love the comfort and appearance of this watchband.  However, the quick release pins do not hold.  I nearly lost my watch several times during the first day I wore it.  If they will add strong pins, the bands would be awesome."
3.0,I loved the phone pocket and these were not see through which was a concern being white.  Material is thick. My only issue was they were kind of loose. I expected them to be more stretchy and tighter fitting
3.0,Its okay!
3.0,I ordered the pack of 3 long leggings. One of the 3 in the packet was a capri leggings. Very disappointed. These are great but you should check all 3 pieces before taking tags off if you buy the multi packs. Don't assume all 3 are the same by checking 1. I pulled tags off of mine without checking them before I realized this.
3.0,"The picture is misleading. Product size different than the picture. Very good quality , by the way."
3.0,"I sent this bag back because it was too small for my needs and had an odd odor, however it is nice looking."
3.0,My 8 year old son wanted to be Pumpkin Head Man from Minecraft. We thought this would really make the costume. It came all squished and folded in a box and we couldn’t get it to look right. But it was made well and they used good materials. It’s definitely made for an adult sized head and I knew that when I bought it but I thought we could pad the top and make it work. It was awkward for him to wear and so he hardly wore it at all. But he was happy anyways and so I’m happy. It was adorably priced.
3.0,Only problem it's hard to reshape after you remove it from packaging
3.0,So bad quality . Don’t buy . I returned the item and they are charged me again!
3.0,Color different. I ordered the bergundy. Looks mite like red.
3.0,Very bright pink unfortunately
3.0,"The pants are soft, and comfortable, but they are a bit snug in the hips."
3.0,Nice tights just weren't for me.
3.0,"The glasses are not my style, but my girl loves them."
3.0,"Works with blue colored clothes, jeans, but not a big winner.  For the price? I am happy!"
3.0,"I understand this is plastic, but it makes so much noise as you walk and I couldn't deal with the strong rubber smell."
3.0,It’s ok.. haven’t worn it yet..
3.0,"Very thin cotton material, at least it came with the filters"
3.0,The shirt is very soft but if you want an oversized fit size up!
3.0,Poorly made .. zipper has issues
3.0,Wanted to love this but it is pretty shapeless and runs big.
3.0,needs to be worn a few times cuts into your skin.
3.0,Cute T shirt but runs on the small side and is short. I usually wear an XL and this is snug.
3.0,It sure is pretty but it broke on the third day. What a bummer.
3.0,"The turtle neck is very soft as suggested.  However, the sizing is off.  Make sure to order up a size."
3.0,"Nice umbrella, 8 year old loves it.  However the bear's nose fell out and got lost."
3.0,I don’t like  the seam
3.0,"The band is ok, not bad.<br /><br />The seller could do better with their packaging. Not too much of a thought given.  Maybe a small printed note of the embossed letterings. It is kind of hard to read.<br /><br />Got another item, similar price point from another vendor. (pic attached)  I  was pleasantly surprised with the packaging."
3.0,"I bought this in a Large and normally wear a Large and it's EXTREMELY small.  I could not fit this over my thighs.  There is a stretchy band in the back but it does not stretch much.  The quality is nice, but it may be referring to a kids size.<br /><br />It's 12-1/2&#34; wide and will stretch to 17&#34; wide.<br />The length is 22&#34; long."
3.0,"Cute, especially for the price.  The bust shaping is quite high and the fit runs small.  I am usually a dress size 8 and bathing suit 10.  I ordered the Medium but wish I had a Large to try on to see if it would be more comfortable."
3.0,Eh. For what it is it’s fine. The earpieces aren’t great. Sound quality is ok. More of a novelty but useful for some.
3.0,"One of the lights didn't work, they are pretty flimsy but cute.  Fun for the holidays."
3.0,Not as good of quality that I was expecting.  But for the price it is wearable.
3.0,"Ordered umbrella to replace a Tote that I previously lost!  It has massive coverage and am pretty sure a village could get under it and stay completely dry, however it is bulky and quite heavy to carry in my purse.  Wish I could find the previous Tote umbrella, but fear they no longer make it."
3.0,Its ok.....quality not that great but good value.
3.0,Very thin which is perfect for Florida in the winter. I do wish the inside wasn't completely white. The picture advertised is not that way. Very vibrant. No stretch around wrists so you can't push sleeves up too far.
3.0,Not bad but not the best fabric quality..but does the job
3.0,Neck size small. The shirt ran small in the arm area. Really cute & fabrics great ...the sizing was off. I had to return.
3.0,"So, I was disappointed to discover that these were not silicone and blamed myself for assuming,  but the title clearly says these are silicone, so it's just deceptive. They are useful, but I also didn't realize you would get 5 adult and 5 child size, and since I don't need child size, I've paid for 10 but really only have 5 that will work for me. The concept is a good one, and it eliminates the ""bellows"" effect that happens from a lot of fabric masks, but just make sure that you read the description clearly and know what you are buying."
3.0,"Easy to adjust, and tie."
3.0,Hangs kind of funny. Still pairs with many great things in the fall....
3.0,"Granddaughter so excited to receive, bought one size larger than she wears so would be a little baggy and no amount of adjusting straps helped. Way too small."
3.0,"The dress looks cute... It was too small though. Partially my fault because I read that they run small. My only complaint is the fabric is like Halloween costume material so when I opened it I was worried before I even tried it on. The size portion is my fault. Otherwise, would probably look really nice on the right body style."
3.0,Watch out and now your size in earrings....they are real some and clip ons didnt stay on that well but fast shipping
3.0,Super reflective. Bought as part of a Halloween costume and it definitely worked. I would recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
3.0,"Super cute, but is very fragile.....the first time I wore it at lease three seams ripped. I'm currently sewing them back together, hoping to get through one more event in this outfit. It looks super cute, fits well and I got a TON of compliments, but every time I moved it ripped."
3.0,"My size is 10.5, 2E and that's what I ordered. The fit was perfect. The only issue, and why I returned them, is the arch support. My feet do not have much of an arch and this slipper has a huge arch support. Anyone has a 1/2 shoe size knows how difficult it can be to get a decent pair of slippers that fit well (most don't make them in 1/2 sizes). Other than the arch support, the fit was good and they were very cozy. I thought I was finally able to solve my issue. I was so disappointed when I stood to walk in them."
3.0,The leather is nice but the medallion is not that great.
3.0,"Order a size up. I usually can fit a medium for things. However, this was a bust! I’m sad they don’t have any large sizes available as I so want to have this cosplay. It’s crafted well.<br />Although, the gloves/feet would be nice to be bigger"
3.0,It’s a beautiful shirt and I am in love with it. With that being said after washing it it shrunk. Also I only wore it twice and washed it once and it already has a small hole. Really disappointed in the quality of the fabric.
3.0,"These are just as pretty in life as they are in the picture, but really heavy."
3.0,"The main reason that I got this button up shirt was because of the color variation and look.<br /><br />At first the shirt seemed great, it fit perfectly but that is when I noticed a big problem. The buttons are on the opposite side! It is super annoying having to button it up and that is not where the problem ends. The hole where the buttons go through seem to have another accidental hole. Every time I button up the shirt, it goes right through the hole that it’s not supposed to go through and removing the button from there is always a pain. Also the quality of the shirt itself is okay, not the best and not the worst.<br /><br />Honestly, if this shirt had the buttons and the button holes fixed, I wouldn’t mind using it at all. I think this product deserves 3 out of 5 stars. I hope this review helps you make an educated purchasing decision"
3.0,"My wife has ordered several of these dresses in the past. This one was too short, yet loose. The design was beautiful and the material was soft."
3.0,I like the pattern and the way the fabric feels. However they fit really oddly. I could put them on backward and they fit the same as when worn properly. It’s like they forgot to add extra fabric in the back to accommodate the backside. Maybe try ordering a size or two larger if you buy these.
3.0,"It is nice but it is tiny.  Its not the size of a regular bead.  Its more the size of a spacer.  It is almost hidden by the beads on the bracelet.  But it is good quality, you just need to arrange the beads so it isn't next to any huge ones."
3.0,i mean. it exists. probably a little shorter than it looks and certainly not as poofy but it's not too itchy and it serves the purpose well enough.
3.0,Huge arm holes
3.0,I love the material but it seems to be a weird shape. Haven't figured it out<br />just yet. May have to re-figure the shape.
3.0,Small but loved matching my daughter
3.0,"It does not look like the picture and much shorter.  I’ll keep it because it’s still cute, just not at all what I thought."
3.0,"In good faith I cannot rate at this time, I’m not sure if I’m keeping the items. They seem to be cut small in the arms, in comparison to one I’ve had over a year ago.<br />I do love the style and warmth."
3.0,not the same quality as picture and if your tall go two sizes up for the “ stacked “ look
3.0,Adjustable straps both broke after first wear.
3.0,"It is nice, I thought it would be a bit bigger and heavier."
3.0,Ballooned out weirdly on me.  My friend bought the same top (she's a few inches talled and much slimmer) and it looked great on her.  Would make a great cover up but I was looking more for a blouse to wear to work.
3.0,Nice soft band but paw prints wear off
3.0,The material is thick but the fit is boxy and unflattering. The lace is only in the front and does not go all the way around.
3.0,Fit incredibly awkwardly. I’m busty and somehow it was both too tight and too large at the bust because of the strange fit. Too tight at the bottom also to be loose and flowy and too large at the waist/hips to be loose but streamlined. If this sounds weird and makes no sense it’s because the fit was so awkward
3.0,"Can only be wear a few times,  then the color change"
3.0,"These are very pretty, but they are rose gold, not yellow.  That doesn't really show in the picture, nor are they identified as such.  I needed them for an event so made due, but otherwise would have returned them."
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful! But very large. Even with taking measurements beforehand this arrived one , maybe 2 sizes too big."
3.0,This is the most comfortable cover up I have ever owned. So light and breathable. Wish I would have not dried it in the dryer after washing it. 😳Shrunk almost completely in half. Lol
3.0,I think I purchased these in 3 or 4 different colors. Every. Single. One. Fit differently. Incredibly frustrated and disappointed. The one pair that was the closest to fitting right/TTS was Navy. Cute but had camel toe; I kept them anyway and just wear them on upper body days. Go with another brand otherwise you’ll be fighting to find the right fit.
3.0,had to return it runs small. Really wanted it to fit love the dress
3.0,"Overall the jacket is nice.  However, my wife ordered a size larger than she usually gets.  What we got was a jacket that is smaller than she needed.  So order bigger than you need."
3.0,Bought almost a year ago. Worked pretty well for a while. Connection issues occasionally as well as failure to alarm. When it is working it definitely does the job. It stopped shocking recently which is the only reason I bought it. I don't think I'll spend the kind of money they're asking for again for something that lasts less than a year. Other reviews seem to say the same thing.
3.0,"It’s too short. I like maxis that drape the floor. I’m 5’7” and I always wear maxis with flat sandals, but this one is ankle length."
3.0,Ordered a size small and it was very tight! 5’2 140lbs. Order a size up!
3.0,I really wanted to love these tops but I just found they were poorly made. The fit and cut was not flattering and needless to say they were returned.
3.0,The bras are great!!  They run small though!!
3.0,Nice fabric Too large by regular size worn.
3.0,Cute but baby wouldn’t keep it on
3.0,"We regularly run into the issue where coffee ends up on top of the cap due to a poor seal with the top needle or edge of the K-Cup.  It does not affect the performance of the cup being poured, but then you open the Keurig to remove the cup the liquid pours off making a mess.  It is an issue they address on their website, but both my fiance and myself have tried their suggestions to no avail. I will be trying to put a rubber washer in the top to try and create a better seal, but out of the box it was a bit disappointing.  Also to get a strong enough cup of coffee we find we need to grind our beans twice as fine."
3.0,"The Sunsoul ""Tribal Boho Gypsy Brass Bangle Bracelets arrived with an extra treat - an extra bracelet. So I have 13 of these gold toned bracelets. Four of the bracelet are much better that all the rest - they are thicker and stronger than the rest - the designs are very visible, interesting and the bracelets are rounded  inside and outside. The next four are much thinner - no design on the flat inside of the bracelets - on the outside there are a series of golden little bumps - some of which look like they melted together leaving just a solid area and breaking up the pattern. Lastly is the 5 least quality ones that are (I think) supposed to be a rounded band (inside and outside) on the bracelet with the slightly larger golden bump. Unfortunately the bumps can be on the outside of the bracelet and then on the side, then the other side then back to the outside of the bracelet. Some are full bumps , others half bumps, some melting together. I would wear or give my granddaughters the first grouping. The other two groups I might give my younger grandchildren to play with.  This product is made in India."
3.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this and trying it on, especially since it seemed like it would be great for people with wide set breasts. I ordered a small, my usual bralette size, and it fit me like a medium. I was very disappointed since the item appears high quality and very cute, but as there was no extra small option available, it seems I won’t be able to wear one after all."
3.0,I liked the sequins however I didn’t like the fit. Reading the previous reviews made me go up a size and that didn’t work so I had to send it back. It definitely did not hang off of my shoulder even though the size was bigger.
3.0,"These pajamas are super soft and comfortable. However, I did not like the fit of the shirt. It was kind of small for my liking"
3.0,"1.6mm gauge is not accurate! In the picture,, it says both gauges for either jewelry are the same. Not true! The snake has a thicker gauge and unless you plan to widen your piercing hole, it will not slide in.<br /><br />Very disappointing that this was false advertising. The other piercing fit just fine & is cute. But bought this bundle especially for the snake... ):"
3.0,Great product but be prepared to possibly have to sew.<br />I either have a small head or these are just too big 🤷‍♀️
3.0,"Nah, won't wear it.  Cheap fabric too."
3.0,Not accurate size. Still worked since I was going to 3/4 anyways ..
3.0,"The glasses are very stylish! They pair great with any sort of look. I honestly thought they were high designer glasses! The only thing I'm really upset about is that I opened the package and the glasses were to the slightest damaged, a small dent in the frame above the eye - which is noticeable. Another small scratch/dent inside of the lends. (It may look like fuzz but it does not wipe off with the cloth)<br />I would like to send back the product but I am going on vacation in the next couple of days and I'm afraid I won't receive a new pair in time. :-("
3.0,"This cap is satin lined and I really like the feel of it’s. It protects my natural hair well, but the head band elastic became loose after a few wears and now it slides back a bit during the night when I wear it."
3.0,it was great but i got a youth and ment to get a x large for hubbys birthday so he just framed it
3.0,Was very fragile
3.0,5’9 140lbs ordered a medium & This is not long sleeves. Returning & trying a different one from this brand.
3.0,looks great feels great ... the red part and logo are a sticker that scratches up very easy . the rest is made of metal and the part that sticks out to hold the key loop broke off after 2 weeks of use ... its no way near worthy of the H3 logo or the price i would value this at a $0.99 key chain.... im heart broken over this item...
3.0,Why is only for woman’s ???
3.0,These sunglasses come with a nice case and they are mirrored. They truly are very oversized.
3.0,"Ring itself is beautiful, however, within a matter of weeks, my daughters finger it now black where it lays."
3.0,"I am updating my pervious review (below) - it took over a month, but the smell is gone and I love my bracelet and wear it often.<br /><br />I actually love the look of this bracelet and it appears to be good quality. However, it arrived with a strong mold/mildew smell so I assume it was stored in a damp warehouse for a long period of time. I went through several rounds of spraying it with Frebreeze and hanging it in my screened in porch to air it out over 2-3 weeks. The result is that the smell has diminished ...slightly. I'm wearing it today but I am still self concious of the odor. I will continue my efforts in hopes the smell eventually fades."
3.0,Too small and cheap looking. Gave to my friends teenage daughter.
3.0,"These swim shorts fit okay when I first tried them on, but they were definitely not tummy control! I ordered the size the chart indicated, but they were still really loose. After I wore them for a day, they were completely stretched out and falling off! If you buy these swim shorts I would absolutely size down, but don't expect them to control tummy bulges."
3.0,"I like  the style and fabric. A bit long but should  be fine with 3"" heels"
3.0,"Seemed like it would be a good bra. However,  it was bought for a tween with a less than full A cup. This bra has a MOLDED cup. That means, even if nothing is filling the cup, it will still remain fully rounded. This was not appropriate for my girl. On top of that, the cup size seemed like it would fit at least a full B."
3.0,"Looks better for women without curves. Cut is to European..and looks better on women who have a ""stick-like"" figure."
3.0,Pretty but the sizing is way off.
3.0,"This is a decent quality however, it's not as comfortable as I had hoped. I have a small wrist and this band on the shortest loop is still too big."
3.0,Nice quality but it runs small.  Adjustable straps!
3.0,I don't know how good they are. Still sitting in the box.  Pack very well.
3.0,They are not true to size and will not keep the watch in one place or situated on the wrist in a comfortable position.
3.0,This dress kinda see thru and cheap fabric.
3.0,"I'm on my second one of these as I lost the first one and needed a replacement.  I doubt these will work that great in extreme cold temps, but they would definitely be an improvement on not having anything on your face at all.  I actually use mine the most as a glorified sleeping cap as my house has ridiculous insulation issues and I do not like running the heater at night as it drys the air up and jacks up the utility bill too much.  Both my first one and second one had a tag on the inside of the hood below where your hairline and must be removed or your neck will hate you.  Removal of the tag was fairly easy and if done carefully will not damage the stitching of the seem.  I'm not exactly sure what the difference was between my first one and the second one, but the second more recent one I got gets itchy pretty quickly when worn regularly, but is alright if worn inside out.  The material is smoother on the outside than on the inside so this may be why this helps.  Again, not sure why the second would be itchy and the first one was not but perhaps there are slight differences in material from lot to lot or from whatever factory they are being made at.<br /><br />I fly radio controlled slope gliders as a hobby and this can mean standing facing into 30-40mph winds and higher especially during the winter months in Southern California.  Not only is it darn cold, but if it is a coastal or desert slope there is also a fair bit of sandblasting going on.  The initial reason I purchased this hood was to keep my face and neck warm as well as my nose, mouth, ears etc free of sand and grit, and for this purpose, coupled with some nice goggles it has served me very well.  On the slope I have used it as a full hood as well as a dickey.  As a dickey you just fold in the portion that goes over the head and stuff it down the back of your neck.<br /><br />I think I paid around $18 for my first one which I got directly from Under Armour's ebay store, and the second I paid $25 bucks for hear on Amazon."
3.0,"Son muy bonitos pero son muy pequeños, dicen que de 6 a 12 años, mi hija tiene 6 y le quedan muy justos."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong. I love the look of this. But, as the tag states, Made In China. That's not necessarily a nad thing but their size guidlines must be entirely different than ours. As expected, one size up for sweatshirts, even though I always had no problem with a XL. So, just to be on the safe side since I'm ordering online, I got XXL. It's still a little tight at the stomach. Everywhere else is good and loose. In a time when guys stuff is getting smaller such as the XL being the new Small and shirts are getting shorter so they show your crack, I'm extremely disappointed in this. I also got the XXL because it was $40 cheaper than XL. I don't get the reasoning as it's the same seller and fulfilled by Amazon. The way things are going, in 10 years, guys will be wearing bras instead of shirts for as short and tight things have been getting over the years. You might think it's because I'm fat but lo and behold, everything I own in XL fits a little loose on me. I might keep it. I might not. It just depends on how much this is going to annoy me being tight around the gut."
3.0,"The material is so soft and pretty.. I wanted to love this dress, but the halter part just was entirely  to big . Almost like two different sizes. I returned it"
3.0,"This dress is super cute, comfortable, and really cheap. I was excited to get it, but beware of the wonky seam. I started a return and then realized it was made that way when I saw it on the model.  It is right there on the picture, but I somehow missed it when ordering.  It’s so strange I don’t think I’ll wear it out in public, so this will be a dress to wear around the house."
3.0,It's ok.  Way way bigger than I thought.
3.0,"these are ok, not great.  because the slider is not attached, they move around quite a lot."
3.0,"The material was of good quality, but the way the top fit was more like a tank, than an off the shoulder."
3.0,Product was as stated. Price fair for the quality. I try for the most auhentic Santa look. These are ok but I'm sure a better pick can be made at a brick and mortar search rather than over the internet. Good for halloween etc but would not reccommend for an important Santa gig. I will keep these as a back-up set of glasses.
3.0,OK for fun - need to get the real thing
3.0,Nicely made but the size was way off for me. Ended up using the other dress I bought at the same time.
3.0,Cute dress but was way too short on me. I’m 5’10 size 14 I ordered an XL but was slightly big & too short. Had to return it.
3.0,"Well I wouldn't say it's bad but once I got it the chain broke in the first five minutes of holding it ,the watch is nice but if you carry it around and drop it a few times some pieces may break off."
3.0,Mini mini dress or blouse.
3.0,Not a cheap plastic head band but horns came bent weird and I can’t bend them the way they should be without breaking them
3.0,Very nice and as pictured and described but a little heavy if you have larger ear lopes! It just doesn't sit right but I am going to try and adjust it somehow!
3.0,Runs slightly smaller than expected. Narrow with no stretch. But good for price.
3.0,Material is pretty chintzy and there are no tags in the mostly adquate hemming. The fit and sizing is on point. I would have liked to have paid a bit less for the Chinese quality.
3.0,not a great material. none of the sizes fits my husband's shirts. but you might be lucky to make a better use of this set. Not a bad deal for the price
3.0,Cute earrings. I bought them for myself but they're really small so o gave them to my daughter.
3.0,"I ordered in a size small and it was still too big for me. I'm 5'6'', 113 lbs, 32A for reference. You can't tighten the shoulder straps and it ties in the back, but you can only tie it to a certain extent. The way the top is designed, you can't tie it as tight as possible, so as tight as it could go on me, it was still too big and falling off. Which is sad because I love the design and the top itself is cute. Just wish they had a smaller size or designed it differently so you can make it more fitting."
3.0,"I loved the dress, originally ordered an XL and returned for a large.  The fabric is very cheap looking so I returned it."
3.0,Gave this as a gift. It was 2 different sizes that kinda confused us. Decent quality.
3.0,I dislike that all the dress I purchase are in such tiny packages until the wrinkles are just so bad. The dress was to be worn to a church gathering.
3.0,Runs really small through the bust.
3.0,Not really fond of the fabric but it’s not awful and can be swagged up a bit. For the price it is pretty good.
3.0,"Way to small.  Fortunately they stretch.  They need to offer larger sizes.  Also, I hate that I have to get colors I don't want.  They should offer a choice of colors without the mix.  I have to buy black just to get white when I only want the white.  The good part is beside all the complaining they are a perfect design of underwear and I will buy again.  I don't recommend anyone buying the who is over a small.  They are wayyy small.  But the design is A+"
3.0,Pretty but after wearing it a few times<br />It turned dark
3.0,The socks look as expected however are rough on your feet. The material is so rough that you can feel the impressions of the thick lace on your feet when you walk which makes them uncomfortable. I will not repurchase these.
3.0,Very pretty but very heavy
3.0,"Both sticks were broken. I can’t wear them. I want to keep them, but I need the sticks. Thus three stars. It would be a five star if I could wear them."
3.0,This bag looks great. I love that aspect. It had a really loose dark brown inner liner which made it nearly impossible to find anything inside. It was so annoying! I ended up cutting it out which was a huge improvement.  The straps started peeling after maybe two months. Not happy about that. It's pretty heavy just on its own. I want to like this bag but it's just disappointing.
3.0,The color was not the blue I hoped for but a little different.  I expected the look of a baseball cap but it is a thinner cap and not exactly the look I hoped for.  But it met the description that was provided when I purchased.
3.0,"Bought this belt in November 2016 and have used it nearly everyday as a dress belt for work.  Today the leather split apart, unusable now.  Buckle is still working fine.  Have never had a leather belt crack like this.  2/3/2020"
3.0,Not really what I hoped for. Just too confined in them.
3.0,"Just WAY too big!  And it costs nearly as much to ship it back as it cost, so not worth it!"
3.0,"Love the jacket but it is not at all made for temperatures under 40 degrees.. super soft, nicely sized, fashiable"
3.0,"I thought this was a clutch sized purse when I bought it, it's still slender, to carry minimal items, but it's more small to medium sized."
3.0,"Inexpensive, but decent quality for such a cheap price.  Not sure why it says hollow because it doesn't appear to be.  Overall, quality about what one would get in dollar thrift store."
3.0,The pajamas are comfy but it they had a longer version would have opted for that. Not wanting a dress but bending over to grab something is kinda sketchy
3.0,It’s marketed bigger than it actually is
3.0,"I really did not care for the way these shoes fit my daughter. They were so much smaller than expected. I got her regular size and was able to put them on, it just wasn’t easy. I’d recommend ordering a size up to all future buyers."
3.0,"Good pendant considering the price, but you get what you pay for:<br />the stones are affixed poorly (we're talking glue here rather than by being actually set into metal), and the glue is visible.<br />The main large stone is lovely, but the setting for the smaller stones is crooked and the stones affixed to it by glue.<br />I will be using as a pendulum rather than as a necklace to help preserve it."
3.0,"Headbands absorbed well, but the elasticity left something to be desired.  Probably wouldn't buy them again.  Disappointed with this product."
3.0,This holder is adorable but it's pretty short. It doesn't work well for me since I have a ton of longer necklaces. They end up dragging on my dresser. Would recommend if you have short length necklaces.
3.0,"So. I didn’t receive the long dangle earrings I ordered. I receive these hoop earrings which are lovely, just not what I ordered for graduation gift."
3.0,Runs a little small and could be a little softer
3.0,Not meant for people with big calf’s!!!!! HONESTLY
3.0,"This cardigan is MUCH shorter than the picture shows, about waist length, not hip length. Fits ok but a bit tight and I can't wear it tied. It looks really off if I try to tie it but it still looks good. It's really gorgeous and I love the sparkly beaded detail. For reference, I'm 5'2&#34; and I'm normally a size 14."
3.0,Used three pair of these ear rings has hanging declarations on lampshade.  Looks very sharp.
3.0,considering sending back. material is cheap and it runs VERY SMALL.
3.0,Ordered white. Top part was cute but pockets are bulky and long. Returned.
3.0,Son loves the FNF and the hoodie it self looked great but unfortunately this hoodie runs so small it didn’t fit like we had hoped even though we ordered on the larger end of his size. I’d order 2 sizes up if you like a comfy fit. We ordered one size up and it was still too small
3.0,This is a cute dress but the material was super thin and very clingy. It's very silky. Cute print though. I was on the fence on returning it but it wasn't just amazing to me. It fit about knee length on me. I'm 5' 6 and 1/2&#34; and 120 lbs.
3.0,I love these however they are so small beautiful but tiny
3.0,"Got this today and I knew what to expect since it’s pretty cheap. It’s very thin and sort of see through. I’d be okay with that except that it had a hole at the bottom of the hood. I could easily sew it up but when I buy something, cheap or not, I expect to get it without holes. It came in a clear bag that was taped up like it was previously opened or they just wanted me to struggle to open it. I’m gonna have to return this."
3.0,It runs a bit big but very cute on.
3.0,Cheap price. Cheap earrings. I got what I paid for.. I guess. On the positive side they do look just like the picture except a tiny stud was missing from one my earrings.
3.0,I bought two pairs. They were supposed to be two different colors. I received two of the same color. I am tall 5'10 and they only go about halfway up my calf. I've noticed very little results using them.
3.0,It's just too short. The fabric is thick which is nice and comfortable.
3.0,"There is only one size, and yes it probably will fit all, but maybe a bit more difficult for some. Also, there is no design to help ventilate the moisture from breathing, not around the nose/mouth area, only two vents at each side on the cheek. I wear glasses and this is a fog maker to my glasses. Also it is pretty thin too, but certainly will help to keep your face warm. I actually prefer another balaclava made by Chaos."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5278bf8fb8a2288802f8b4068077173d]] Colors are bright, sleeves just right, hangs to my knees which is good but the fabric is VERY THIN‼️ I still like it and it will do for airport travel and tights! I’m normally a large but I bought a XXL so it runs small."
3.0,"I got a medium and I'm 5'5&#34; and 130lbs and it was quite small, too short, and the sleeves were kind of short and tight."
3.0,Cute material a little off
3.0,"Always an adventure ordering the mainland China/Korea menswear. Four times out of five, I like what I get. It's just not what I thought I was getting. This time, I thought I was getting a fairly fitted, thick sweater. What I got was an extremely loose & floppy tunic made out of (apparently) cooked pasta. Not even al dente cooked pasta. I know this is going to go south (literally) after I wash it a few times, but in the meantime it looks good. If I were that kind of gal, I'd wear it with leggings & boots. But I'm not, but you could. Like most orders from this part of the world, it got to me in Pacific Northwest U.S. of A. in a little less than 2 weeks. Oh & my item is gray & darker gray, like I expected. None of the brownish/yellowish/bluish shades other reviewers mentioned."
3.0,"Really pretty, but a bit too bulky and awkward for a toddler who likes to put stuff on by herself.  I also expected it to be a tad longer."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this pajama lounge set. Upon arrival I noted that the colors were definitely not as vibrant as the photos indicated and the material was like a washed out thin cotton. There was strings hanging everywhere from the sew job - a little crooked in places. The shirt fits loose at the top and then tapers down at the bottom. a the short bottoms had a very strong elastic band, that I found to be too tight. I feel like with a couple wears and washes the outfit would be unraveling and wouldn’t last."
3.0,These fit well but are not squat proof unfortunately. Since 90% of CrossFit has some kind of squat I can’t really wear them for what I wanted to. The color is cute though.
3.0,Very pretty but too long.
3.0,Difficult  to adjust. Not really packable.
3.0,"This is a pretty cute little necklace, definitely not a choker and really no way to make it a choker. It’s about equivalent to the jewelry I buy my daughter at Claire’s or Justice and wouldn’t expect to pay more than that price range. It will definitely find its way to her jewelry box.  It might be cute for the 4th of July, but other than that, I cannot see myself wearing this."
3.0,"Not as soft as they look... To put it bluntly, these cuffs could have literally been picked out of my 4-year-old's dress up box (minus the fabric of course). Trying them on instantly unlocked some repressed memories from my childhood, cool but also super awkward timing. The ""fur"" is super thin and doesnt add much (if any) comfort, but it does look like the photo for the most part. Easy to put on, dont have trouble with them coming undone or Anything. Once theyre clicked closed they stay that way until you or your partner unlatches them. The latches make it easy to unlock and open them in a pinch. Considering the price, its a pretty decent set of cuffs for light beginners, especially if you've been on the fence about trying them (no big loss or shame if u end up not feeling it you know), and people who like feeling cheap costume grade cuffs cut against their wrists (guilty 🙍). Would probably give 4 stars considering the price, but the childhood memories took it down to a questionable 3.<br /><br />TLDR; get what u pay for. Look nice but very cheap quality & not as cushioned as they look. I still like using them though so you probably will too!"
3.0,"I  finally got the two I ordered yesterday I ordered on 10 November got them on the 20th, so if your in a hurry for it forget it.  Seem to be good so far I bit big for my military canteen  and is not insulated."
3.0,They won’t change colors. One giraffe is missing half the color. Posts were bent when received.
3.0,"The front does not close/cover much of the front of the body.  Other than that it fits well (back, sleeves, length."
3.0,"Loved it, but the middle seam tore all the way to my crotch, what a bummer!"
3.0,Love the shirt it just was too small
3.0,"not the greatest quality sweater. It is heavy and kind of scratchy, there is random pieces of black stitching in the gray fabric on the back. Not terrible for the price but I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,"The stitching is an odd reddish color, sort of like the tights had been washed with red shop cloths (my picture includes gray concrete, white tag, and bricks to help with color rendering, but doesn't quite show how notable the stitching color is) The color is uniform across all the stitching, so I think it's intentional. But it's not the white stitching I expected from the pictures, and my wife doesn't look too pleased, so even if the tights work out functionally, I think they're not going to be something she wants to wear after-ride."
3.0,"The stickiness hurts when you remove it and it’s doesn’t support as well as I hoped. I still felt I wasn’t being supported, even after tightening the lace up strings."
3.0,Got a large but the large doesn’t mean for large breast.. the material is not flattering
3.0,Tiny. Pendant fell off after a month and a half...
3.0,"They all worked fine,but some glasses in the set were better then other ones."
3.0,"Love the dress, great length, very comfy, but it's see through.  You have to ABSOLUTELY wear a complete under garment. Not just a bra and a slip."
3.0,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to order a size up than I usually wear.  I'm a small and ordered a medium.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 120lbs.  A medium would barely get over my shoulder and was riding up my crotch!!  I realize most would use this as a beach cover-up, but I wanted it as a lightweight summer romper and looked like it would fit an adolescent.  The model wearing it is probably wearing a large for it to have that amount of looseness.<br /><br />The style and print is cute.  So they have that going for them.<br /><br />GET TWO SIZES UP.  I'm serious."
3.0,This is really a cheap piece but very nice at that.  It is flimsy so don't wear it while doing anything strenuous or it might break.  Just for looks it is great!
3.0,Very cheap material fits good and no need to wear a bra with the ruffle. My only complaint is it's very cheap material but for the price it's good for wearing around the house.
3.0,fits as expected. I'm 5'7”. 165. The black faded quicker than it should have. After 4 washings.
3.0,It's okay. Definitely has a made in China feel. Payless shoes are probably a better quality. But ultimately they are fine for the 2 months my son will wear them this summer at the pool. I wouldn't buy again or recommend. But they were fine for the price.
3.0,The purse is beautiful ! However after one use only the hook holding the chain broke :(
3.0,Didn’t fit watch right and was loose & broken soon.
3.0,"The outfit is super cute, however upon delivery there was a very strong chemical smell. It took 4 washes to get it out"
3.0,Dont know it was a gift to someone
3.0,"Its a decent watch, had to remove some of the links because it was too large for me but other than that, it serves the purpose and for the cost, I can;t say much more. 3 stars because it took long to get to me."
3.0,It looks really nice in the picture but it is very poor quality. It's more like a under shirt material.
3.0,Beautiful but way too short. Good for 5 foot men.
3.0,"We loved these, so cute and comfortable and my daughter could get them on and off by herself. The only drawback is that the Velcro stopped working pretty quickly. I may try to put a snap on them because my daughter love them but they fall off when she’s running around."
3.0,Nices shirts for the money but run very. small. I had to pay for return shipping.
3.0,"I ordered a Small and at 5'3, 135 lb, and cup size B this was WAY too Baggy in the chest. The rest of the outfit was a bit larger on me. The arm bands are CRAZY itchy and I had to staple them so they would stay up on my arm but not break off if I had to use some muscle, but its a cute outfit overall for the price. Had to pin the chest portion closed in order to not show the world my chest. Fine for Halloween."
3.0,Disappointed in this product
3.0,Cute ring but doesn't look like real rose gold at all. Also the texture of the ring makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear. I bought this as a substitute for my wedding band to wear during the last month of pregnancy as my band didn't fit my swollen fingers anymore. It served it's purpose and didn't turn my finger green even when I wore it doing dishes or bathing my son.
3.0,"This item is exactly what is described and quite frankly exactly what I was looking for, but being a tall girl (5'9"") I found the sleeves to barely reach my wrists. This is a minor problem, but one that ultimately made me return the item as I prefer my sleeves to be too long if anything for a more cozy feel. If you are any shorter than me and don't have freakishly long arms, this shouldn't be a problem for you."
3.0,The bag is okay - although a little smaller than the listed dimensions on the description. The biggest issue was that the bag arrived with indentations and folds/creases in the leather.
3.0,A novelty Keychain that best describes my patients for stupidity. That of a chopping block! Trip like I do?
3.0,The quality of leather was less than expected.
3.0,Cute but missing the silver that I wanted.
3.0,Very thin and label says 100% polyester. Wish it was cotton and actually stayed on the baby’s head as it turns and twists and falls off every time the baby slightly turns their head.
3.0,"Order the next size larger, wished I had!!!"
3.0,Cons. One size didn't fit me and I'm within the size range at 5'7 155lbs. Normally wear a size 8 pants. I had to pull these on like tights and the thin elastic waist will create a muffin top on just about anyone.  They are also see through on the rear. If you have pets these do seem to attract every fur.<br /><br />Pros. The fabric is incredibly soft and slimming. It doesn't show any bumps or lumps in the legs or rear.<br /><br />I could deal with the slightly see through rear and wear long shirts.  It the waistband is too tight. I might try the plus size leggings.
3.0,"These were okay. My glasses still fogged up just as bad as they did before using them. I honestly wouldn't buy them again. Unfortunately, it's long past the return date or I would've sent them back."
3.0,Fabric is very thin but soft.  I wear a lightweight shrug with it.  Got many compliments.
3.0,"Did not hold up well and looked very worn after a few washes, would not buy again!"
3.0,"These are super colorful and well packaged, but just be aware they aren’t super high quality. Several had lenses that fell out when taking them out of the box. The lenses go back in, but it was a little annoying. Also, they each have individual plastic wrappers, so it’s very tedious to unpack.<br /><br />Note they are a little small for adults as well. It was more of a fun prop, but just be aware."
3.0,"I love this sweater and the fit is perfect prior to washing, however if you happen to wash it, it will shrink to an almost 3/4 length sleeve. If you are willing to dry clean a 30 dollar sweater then go for it."
3.0,"The eyeglasses case is pretty, durable and easily wipes clean. I like it but I didn’t receive the lens cloth so that’s very disappointing. Good overall...<br />UPDATE: Apparently they read my review because they very politely reached out to me and sent the cloth promptly thereafter. 👍🏾"
3.0,"i like this bag however, i thought it was bigger in picture. u getting addition bag to put your makeup and u can use the other one as a crossbody bag. the only i dont like is d smell of the bag, it has a kinda awful scent. i will use it as my everyday bag."
3.0,"I can wear, but wish was just a little bigger, love the color, received timely."
3.0,Not as lgt
3.0,Too short and didn’t sit right on me. I’m 5”8
3.0,"This jacket is super warm but if you like pockets, they're super tiny so don't count on being able to store things in your pockets. The big ones with the buttons are fake and then you just get two tiny ass pockets. I can barely fit my keys in a pocket."
3.0,Not as pleased as thought would be but other family member loves them.
3.0,I ordered it and used it for a little while but i eventually bought a different one because i didnt like the big size.
3.0,It's very cheap looking. I only planned on using it after a day by the pool so it's fine.
3.0,Visibly good vest but the stitching is already coming apart. Had it a month.
3.0,"So, for the price, this is a great buy. I will say that it is a bit longer than I expected- it pools on the floor for me- about 5 inches of extra length. The ties are a bit flimsy for the weight of the cloak and are already fraying- will have to reinforce this. Also, I ordered the black&purple cloak, but received the black&black. I teetered on which of the two to buy anyway, and they are the same price so ... I decided to keep it. Figured the universe was choosing for me. Overall a bit disappointed. But it will do, because I really do not want to have to wait for a replacement."
3.0,I’m returning this pendent because it looked more red and blue. It is very pretty but not the colors for me. Didn’t show these colors as the prominent color. I saw more pink and softer colors.
3.0,"I like the look and feel of this shirt. The material feels nice but is easily stained. As shown in picture this was a drop of coffee, after cleaning with water, and dried the spot remains."
3.0,"The design is super cute, but when I ordered this the color choice was a darker purple, which is the school color. I received a lighter purple shirt.  So as much as I appreciate you sending the shirt, I’m disappointed I won’t get to wear it."
3.0,Beautiful watch but unable to adjust wrist band. Pin will not come out.
3.0,Very cool but too big the XL run like XXL
3.0,"Will have to hem about 3&#34;, I'm 5'3"
3.0,"They are not particularly soft and the ribbon on the side wrinkles up and makes them feel cheap. I don’t hate them, but I don’t love them either."
3.0,Very thin material doubt it covers any thing if it’s not folded twice. Looks good though.
3.0,"I got this shirt for my friend that wears a medium normally,  could fit small. He's a really fit guy.  5'8"" 145lbs. Got him a size medium,  it was so small he couldn't even button this shirt up,  could barely get his arms out when he was taking it off. Would have fit an 8 year old perfectly."
3.0,The clasp isn’t even in the back!
3.0,it was comfy
3.0,excellent product. but should be more specific because neoprene expected to be .. fabric material is elastic stockings. not retain heat in the fingers but it is efficient to Absorb remaining Sodor for the practice of sport
3.0,"It's a nice hat, this blend of material is hands down the best in a beanie, but it appears to be exactly like my two other merino/possum beanies from other companies that were only $40. The seller was nice, shipped quick, but I honestly can't tell the difference between this $77 hat and my other two $40 ones."
3.0,"Although the description says the watch is unisex, it cannot adjust small enough for a petite woman's wrist. Also it had a strong &#34;metallic&#34; smell out of the box."
3.0,The medium was way too small.  I think I would love it if I got a couple sizes bigger!
3.0,They were supposed to be good to keep your hands warm when working outside in the winter but they did not keep my hands warm.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5518cb61654d96bbc9644b80ed1642e1]] This is SUPER large...<br />So big that I can't be comfortable in it at ALL.<br /><br />I LOVE the embroidery, and if I wasn't small (ish) I would totally love this.<br /><br />The design I think is FOR bigger women who want to cover up, so the model in the pic is misleading. I was swimming in this.<br />It IS cute though.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review."
3.0,Nice weight socks and good length but I question the compression strength does not seem to be accurate.
3.0,"Fits a little loose through the body but the arms are a little snug. I purchased this shirt a size larger than I normally would, knowing that it was a ladies' cut t shirt. It doesn't fit as close as other ladies cut t-shirts I've purchased."
3.0,Liked the (neon!) frame colors but lenses are too dark ....
3.0,"Although the shirt looked nice, it ran quite small. Most of the time, when a shirt runs small, my husband can still wear it, but this one runs a good size too small in shoulders, arms, chest, and waist.<br /><br />Quality of the shirt itself seemed good. It was a heavier weight fabric than many button-downs, but it seemed to be a durable material and looked like it would probably lay well.<br /><br />Just go up a size!"
3.0,"This product is a gift for my zelda fanatic. The spikes came bent and wonky. For the price, I expect better shipping in a bigger box that fits more appropriately to prevent this from happening. Overall, it's a nice mask and I'm excited to see the reaction on Christmas morning."
3.0,The handles were to short
3.0,Good for the first few days. Lining e<br />Keeps feet very warm but the wear and tear is very very quick..didnt even last 2 months.
3.0,"Good fit, cute print, super see through and mesh underwear underneath are really uncomfortable/unnecessary/don't help."
3.0,"I’m 5’ 2” 120lbs. The size chart seemed right but it doesn’t fit great. It’s loose around my waist so it looks saggy in the front. The flares are also huge, double the size I was expecting. I also had to wear a 4” heel for them not to drag on the ground. They are okay but I wouldn’t purchase another pair"
3.0,Not made very well.
3.0,"Love the color and the length, but this definitely looks lie an inexpensive, casual, polyester knit.  The drape reminds me of my mother's pant suits from the 70's; and that is not a good thing.  I was hoping for something I might be able to wear to work, something to simulate a light wool crepe or viscose, but this is not it.  Nevertheless, I have worn this 2 or 3 times and washed it once: no shrinking, stretching, or seams falling apart at this point.  It is not transparent.  The color is a true teal, unlike most &#34;teals&#34; which turn out to be turquoise."
3.0,"I read reviews and ordered based off of others reviews of fit.  I normally wear a small or medium, but was lead to believe to order larger sizes.  So I ordered a large, the length of the shirt was perfect, the sleeves were too short and too tight.  I don't recommend this shirt for anyone who lifts and has developed muscles in the shoulders and upper back."
3.0,They fell apart and I wasn’t able to use them.<br />They need to be attached to the head bands better..
3.0,Shirt fabric very low grade. Shrinks after washing. Logo great.
3.0,"Fits a little big, gets grimy easily."
3.0,"This shipped from China, and it is very very thin--it looks like it is a sweatshirt type but it isnt--it is see through!"
3.0,"I was really excited about the idea of these laces but the reality was kind of disappointing. They are not very stretchy so it’s a struggle to get my son’s shoes on. My purpose in buying them was to avoid the hassle of trying to force his wiggly, squishy kid feet into his sneakers without having to take the laces out. I bought the size that goes up to 13 but I could barely lace up his size 12 shoes using these so I think they run small."
3.0,I like the concept but putting it into practice is difficult.  The small model doesn't have much room for large cords and I don't think you want one too big to fit in your briefcase ... I think if you are disciplined it could work well but the cords do shift and some have fallen out.  You will want to buy clasps to wrap things tight and keep them in place.
3.0,Came a little crushed
3.0,"It’s definitely on the cheaper end of construction / material, but still pretty adorable!"
3.0,"Of the 5 clips, 2 didn't stay together all the time and would come unclipped. Luckily it was 2 colors I wasn't using."
3.0,"I have two other colorful watch bands for my Garmin.  Heck, one of them may even be the same brand as this- but I ordered this beautiful blue one (the color is a nice, bright royal blue) and well, something is wrong.  Oh, I love the soft silicon strap part- even better than the firmer original garmin one.  However, the retainer loop.  You know- that other black rectangle that holds the leftover strap part?  Well, it's too soft and flexible, and it doesn't have a large enough protruding notch to catch onto the band.  So, it always slides around or off.  I know, seems like a simple thing, but it's annoying.  I'm going to just use the loop from a prior band, but still.  This little part wasn't well designed."
3.0,"Left index and middle finger are cold at 19’ on one set of the green gloves. Pinky finger on right hand of one pair is very difficult to insert (feels like it is sewn incorrectly. Second pair was given to my son who complains that they don’t keep his hands warm enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, these are great leather shells."
3.0,its a cute dress but the length of the top os a bit short so the sirt part start just under my breast ( like an empire top) making the skirt really short!
3.0,I almost kept this jacket until I noticed that the dropped shoulder seams were uneven - the right shoulder seam was a good 2-3 inches longer than the left!  I returned it
3.0,This fit really big
3.0,"The wallet is cute and keeps my cards secure, but it's almost impossible to get anything out once I put it in. I know that's what it's sort of supposed to do, but trying to get my cards out resulted in the wallet losing it's shape and the stitching tearing. Also, there was already a hole in it after a week when I put it in my purse. There was nothing sharp in there besides my keys, which I didn't think were sharp enough to cut the leather, but apparently they are, or the leather is weak. It gets the job done but it doesn't seem to last long."
3.0,"The dress is not as sexy as showed on the pictures. The chest area is too high, just as conservative as those in 60’s."
3.0,"it's ok, to me fills to stiff and is uncomfortable, just my experience"
3.0,"Cheap material, but the product doesn't cost that much, so it is what it is.<br /><br />Has a nice tapered fit, and fits a bit snug, but if your into that thing I would recommend this.  If your tall and lanky the arms might not be long enough.<br /><br />If they offered a tall version of this and maybe used a slightly better quality material I think they could manage to charge a bit more and it would be a more win/win situation for them and their customers."
3.0,"Cute stones. Necklace is cheap , clasp broke when opened."
3.0,"Very nice outfit the shirt is perfect but I gave it a 3 star because the shorts are not the length of a boys size 8, they're a bit small for the size ordered."
3.0,"great style，bad quality, it is $27 so I don't expect it would look like a leather jacket. I ended up return it because it has plastic smell. I do love how it looks on me though so it took me a few days to decide to return. This jacket size is smaller comparing to other brands. I am 5.3&#34; and  117 pounds. Usually I get small or extra small, but I choose medium for this jacket, it fits me well."
3.0,nice for the price!! adds a glamouros quotient to ur personality!!
3.0,My daughter wears a 10 usually and this top is a bit on the short side once washed and dried.
3.0,"Pretty sure the listing photos aren't even the sellers'. Not only are both earrings the same design rather than mirrored, but they juuuuust barely look like paperclips so that part doesn't match the listing photo either - nor the box pictured (you just get a plain cheap black box not a nicer quality green one), nor the backing which is silicone and not metal. Overall it's just like someone did a iffy copy of the pictured earrings from someone who didn't understand the design.<br /><br />On the plus side they are extremely featherweighted and genuinely do seem hypoallergenic, so I'll probably just wear 1 earring mixed with something else. But even at their current low cost, they still seem overpriced. I would have rather got what was pictured."
3.0,"The material is weird, no stretch. I wouldn’t say a comfy sweatshirt. It fits the price though. No tag, so who knows if I’m wearing it the right way."
3.0,I like the quality of these but the double flared ones and the tear drop shaped ones do not fit. I am a true size 2 gauge which is what I ordered but the only ones I can wear are the single flare. I plan to gauge up anyways so I will hang onto them but just want others to be aware when buying these that you should probably order down a size.
3.0,Its runs large. But looks cute though.
3.0,"The arm holes are way too big.  I ordered a small and you can totally see boob from the side.  Otherwise very cute dress.  Totally have to dress it up for it to not look frumpy.  Highly recommend long necklace, wedges, cute earrings. It is a heavy dress and it’s long not short and showy.  I’m sending mine back but it would be cute if it fit."
3.0,"I bought these as back ups to my &#34;Power Trip XL&#34; and they are not as nice or as wide as my primary pair.  These seem to have a cheaper plastic and the lenses are not as &#34;polarized&#34; as my primary pair.  They are however very wide at 148 mm and will fit most large heads.  They are also a matted black so they do not have the shiny appeal of my primary pair.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, they are currently out of stock on my other pair so I had to take a chance on these.  And at 35.00 I can't say I would order them because of the difference in lens and matted color.  I guess I have just gotten spoiled with my other pair and was a bit disappointed when I dived these.<br /><br />As far as sunglasses go, they are okay and that is why I am rating them as such."
3.0,"I wish the wand had real ribbon rather than the plastic like ribbon; however, it made no difference to the &#34;Princess&#34; who received the wand."
3.0,Nice  pearls.
3.0,I thought it would have the lavender line in it<br />but it was just black and white. Otherwise very nice.
3.0,"The shoes are more of a cream instead of a white. I would recommend size up , my baby girl wears a 5-5.5 & her feet wear all the way at the top."
3.0,"I like these less than I do the black leather ones...the nubuck, if that's what it is, feels stiffer, and doesn't seem as easy to break in. Color is nice."
3.0,"Liked the dress , but size was not accurate."
3.0,Weird fabric.  Looked cheap
3.0,Fit is perfect for athletic not too muscular people. Quality is exceptionally low. Price is excellent. Don't recommend unless you are comfortable with discarding it after 15-20 wash cycles due to threads falling apart.
3.0,Could be a little thicker.
3.0,This runs large.  I’m 5’3 and 130lbs and the small is pretty loose.  Order size down if you want less of a tank look.
3.0,Im upset that my necklace was stuck inside of the box i received it in. Not like picture
3.0,no bra cups as suggested.
3.0,"Cute style, great case and kit... But they broke the 1st time I wore them"
3.0,Love the quality but I ordered a small received a medium WTH? Really aggravating
3.0,Nice shirt really liked the color (green) however after one wear the hem on the bottom started to come out so that was disappointing. Other then that it is a nice shirt.
3.0,"The size is not US. mine was to be 47"" you get 45"" from the country they are made it. NOT USA."
3.0,This is the less than durable metal and I am waiting for it to start to deteriorate. It might last for a few wearings. The enameling on pieces these days are not durable and only manufacturer for a quick buck.
3.0,These are fine but they don’t stay on very well.
3.0,"I shouldn't complain right, that the tank top is too small and doesn't match the sizing when I can stretch it out?  But who wants to stretch their purchases out because the sizing doesn't match reality?  I guess I'll just have to repurpose this for something else and not order from this manufacturer/seller again."
3.0,Arms were not as loose as they appeared in photos. Decent quality tho sequins were not too sparse
3.0,I love the length of this dress and it fit like a glove. I got multiple compliments on it. I got a size small (5’10- 155lbs) and it fits as expected. The only thing I can’t stand are how the pockets poke out and sometimes hang out of the dress.
3.0,They comfortable however they bunch up on the sides. Material is very soft.
3.0,They fit perfectly however they are not for texting. The way these specific gloves were designed did not match up with how we use our texting fingers.<br />I haven’t had a chance to try them out on a keyboard yet.
3.0,The stones are much smaller than expected.  I may end up sending these earrings back.
3.0,"They are ok, but after wearing for a couple hours my arm started to hurt from how tight they were on the top of the arm band, I don't really use them for a long period of time since this happen every time I wear them"
3.0,This is soft and cute but not what I was hoping for. It's not a true longline bra. It has a regular sports bra sewn into it.
3.0,Definitely size up if you have a booty 😁
3.0,I don't think this is 2mm thick. A bit thin.  Fast shipping
3.0,Backs are too big for earrings and the druzy stone is a tiny bit too small for the gold background.  From afar they are very pretty but I tried 3 different backs & they are all too big.
3.0,Like scarf wish it was wider
3.0,The fabric did not feel like other microfiber underwear I have purchased.  It was not as smooth.  The size was also smaller especially in the pouch area and the space between the legs.  Bits fall out easily but the underwear are okay to wear in non-active or sedentary situations.
3.0,Loved it when it first came but it already started changing color
3.0,CONS: This is not what I expected . The interior side of the bonnet is not satin. I expected the fabric touching my hair to be softer/satin but it’s only the exterior fabric that’s satin. The interior is a coarse material.<br /><br />PROS: the elastic band is very strong and firm and I believe it will last a while
3.0,Dress ripped after washing it one time!
3.0,I liked the jacket a lot it didn’t survive the first wash so I’ll probably buy it again n try something else
3.0,These are cute and I love how big they are but I think they’re dollar store quality. They’re super flimsy and seem like they will break easily. They do come with a wiping cloth and a storage bag
3.0,Shirt was big pants toooo small
3.0,advertisement should show length of strap as i find it too small.
3.0,A little too shiny...
3.0,"All chokers are very pretty my only compliant is they are very cheap material. I opened one of my chokers and almost immediately the clip fell off making it unusable. While they are very gorgeous, they are at such a low price for a reason."
3.0,Would appear to be a very good boot but the right one had a defect.  The left one was comfortable and supportive.  They looked great.
3.0,"I bought this because it was cheap and cute. When it came in, the ""turquoise"" piece was glued on crooked. I was able to pop it off and center it using super glue."
3.0,"The ones I received are not solid purple like the picture. I picked these because of the purple trim. They were different from the other masks. I can still use them, just disappointed."
3.0,I ordered this on short notice - wanted to wear it for Halloween and this was not a size XL!  Probably closer to a Large. I gave it away. Would not order again
3.0,I was disappointed in the product because there were no instructions sent with it. I have never used one before so I surely could use some.<br /><br />J. Hill
3.0,Runs really big.
3.0,a little disappointed that it was as small as it was.....I even ordered a size up and it is still too tight.
3.0,I thought they would be more clear when wearing at night.  Still seeing some glare from the headlights but can’t say if that’s because of my eyes or the glasses
3.0,Cheap fabric- does not drape nicely like the model fabric.
3.0,It runs a little small and there are loose threads. Also the tulle is more blue than black but overall not bad for $6
3.0,I thought they had better form but they are very thin and flimsy.
3.0,"The dress is very nice to look at and mostly comfortable.  It fit everywhere except for the chest.  I wear a 40 DD and this felt like a sports bra up top.  There was no room whatsoever.  I hated to return the dress, but it just wouldn't work for me."
3.0,"A little stiff at first, but after you break it in the cards come out easier."
3.0,cute just closing has issues does not stay close just tried adjusting hoping it lasts
3.0,"It is quite warm, but dont buy it for the pockets. The fit is small, and the pockets on this style aren't that abundant. The jacket is a very close fit, but only one pocket will take an iPhone plus, and that is right by your left jaw, and the shape protrudes. It is good for layering, but don't bother buying it thinking you will get heaps of pockets. If you do stuff your pockets you will look incredibly lumpy, and everyone will know that you have items stowed. I generally dont wear mine as the cut is short as well (I'm 6'1&#34;).  I wish it had bigger pockets, was looser, and was longer. But it has none of these."
3.0,"the top was really small, do not recommend for women who are bigger uptop"
3.0,The wood stain used bleeds. It turns your ear cheese brownish red and stains the hole a little. But they look just like the picture and look good on.
3.0,"Sorry I didn’t take a picture, didn’t feel like it. However the cut of this dress is weird. I am 5’9 1/2, 210 lbs, measurements 38-34-48 and I purchased the XXL. I like my dresses to hug my curves and stop right at or below my knee. This dress stopped maybe 2 or 3 inches above my knee. So, I can’t put on heels with this and wear it to work like I intended to do. It would look way too short and inappropriate. Also, the dress was fitted in the chest and hips but the midsection had this loose baggy fit going on (which could be due to my hips being so much wider than my waist). The fabric was as everyone said, stretchy with good texture and not see through. So, short ladies go for it because it’s not a good fit for is tall ladies."
3.0,Its kinda big  but its a nice dress
3.0,It is very thin
3.0,Kind of tight on the noggin but it looks good.
3.0,It don't look as shiny as the picture
3.0,"The material is very thin, and I don't think they will last long.  After just one wear, the waist band began to twist and roll up."
3.0,"They do what they are supposed to.  But are awkward to use with long hair.  It takes 2 hands to get set,  but they do keep the glasses on."
3.0,"My son loves these cleats! They really seem to help prevent him from rolling his ankles, which was the main reason we purchased this particular cleat. The reason for my 3 star review is the lettering began peeling off before his first game! When I spend more than $100 for a pair of shoes, I expect them to stay completely intact for more than 3 weeks!"
3.0,Comfortable to wear. Range of motion is limited as the bottom of the skirt does not flare and only barely stretches.
3.0,Large and compact
3.0,Although belt was in the size I needed it was not the correct measurement. Order was not as needed.
3.0,"Cute and comfy. Fits fine. But the butt area is sheer, preventing me from wearing as pajamas around the house full of teenage boys!"
3.0,Dress didn’t fit as expected. Was larger than expected and the elastic didn’t fall in the right place.
3.0,I didn't read the discription properly I thought these were sterling silver
3.0,"These are cute, but they are tiny! They are much smaller than they appear. There is really no way to see the 2021 unless you have a magnifying glass!"
3.0,material not great but wearable around the house and out and about... had compliments on the style ..
3.0,"This top runs small. I got one just like it from a different seller but with long sleeves and it fit perfectly, so it's frustrating that two shirts that look almost exactly the same and say the same size are in fact different sizes. It's too small to be comfortable so I'll need to lose a few pounds for this one if I'm going to wear it."
3.0,"Pretty top runs a little small, not as flows as picture shows and it does shrink in the wash.  Still fits fine just not like picture."
3.0,"Socks are great out of the package, but a word to the wise.  Wash them inside out to prevent pillage, and DON'T DRY THEM unless you want your socks a size smaller!"
3.0,"These work well. I wish the cord was a bit longer, I ended up having to use an extension cord to reach me sitting on the couch. The material is a bit flimsy, mine already have holes on the insides and I have only had them one month. But they still work great and heat up quickly."
3.0,"I like this shirt, but I don't think it is worth the price. I purchased a medium one size fits all... I usually wear a medium... And it fit me fine. The length of the front and back of awkward. The front is clearly crop (stop a little under belly button) but the back is near the top of my butt. I think that's too drastic of a difference. It is definitely sheer. But overall, I like it."
3.0,"It's OK, BUT IT IS NOT A VEST. my bad for accepting the name and not believing the pictures. it's not a bad jacket, just misnamed...."
3.0,"Simple, basic, stretchy pants. Good to lounge in. Would not wear to anything special."
3.0,"My granddaughter who is 11 loved these cute Puppy Dog earrings. However, after wearing them for a couple of weeks they hurt her ears.  Her mom put some ointment on her ears so she can wear them on occasions."
3.0,Won't be opened till June 30
3.0,i was looking for a light weight flannel if you want heavy this for you not me
3.0,Not the best fabric but a very pretty print.
3.0,This really is a case of you get what you pay for here. I cannot be disappointed in a purchase from China that cost me $3.38 although it did take a month to arrive. I am not in total awe of it  because the chain is tarnished looking and ugly. The pendant is big and different. I will wear it on a different chain to help make it even more visually appealing. It has the potential to be a conversation starter since it is so large. You cannot beat the price for this evil eye sort of in your face pendant. Very dramatic. I am going to cover the &#34;crystals&#34; with clear nail polish as a preventive measure.
3.0,I  bought these for my son's 2 year birthday for his classroom. The hats run very small so it did not fit some of the kids heads. I happy that I got them as it served it's purpose for the most part. If your child is over 2 years old I would get something that is bigger.
3.0,The fabric is super soft and the dress is comfortable however the yellow is much more see through than I expected. This will just be a house dress because of how see through it is.
3.0,"Its cute and i liked how it fitted, but i didnt realize the back or sleeves were unlined. i am barely seeing it now in the seller photos, but it was disappointing and should be noted somewhere. It is NOT appropriate for work as is….Im a teacher…but i made do and found an under tank. You could prob wear a blazer or sweater too. Its just inconvenient and not ideal for warm weather wearing layers…."
3.0,it is nice medal but the ring opens and you louse the medal need a strong ring
3.0,"I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for my sleeve getting torn midday. It's a beautiful flowy dress, and the medium first perfectly. I am of a curvy figure, 5'1 and 159 lbs. I just wish it didn't rip. I was planning on buying more designs."
3.0,"The print quality was average, and the sweatshirt did not seem new."
3.0,"It is hard to see the knot detail . I also can't seem to get the shoulder to hang right.<br />Maybe it's just me, otherwise , it' is what is on the photo, however the model wears it better."
3.0,It looks great on the model and the pictured shown without a body is exactly how it looks. Way cuter online than in person. The material is stretchy. The colors are bright and vibrant. I can’t say how it looks on because they sent me 3 sizes too small and not the size I ordered.
3.0,"This was a gift for a friend since she works out and would always complain on her wedding band pinching her finger while working on equipment, but the size wss a bit small, so it was snug."
3.0,"The material has 1 trillion little tiny balls all over it “balled” up after one use, one wash. Look at photos I posted. Also it is not “tag free“ and the tag is very annoying and scratchy, it is not soft so I cut it off but it still pokes and annoys me on the side. I wish it was tag-less The tag is sewn in so after trying to remove it I ended up with a hole that I had to sew back up. I have soft pajamas and then throw in a scratchy itchy tag????"
3.0,Not as shown in picture. More like hat style
3.0,The build quality looked fine but they were too big a diameter and wouldnt grip the stem. Am sending back.
3.0,Its cute but waaaay too big. Its frustrating that sizing is not accurate because I was looking forward to use it in the next couple of days.<br />My baby boy is 7 months and uses mostly 6-9 months clothes but these items fit a 1 year old.
3.0,Decent enough sunglasses but they are so narrow they squeezed my head til it hurt. Had to give to my wife.
3.0,I loved the feel and fit of the shaper also the crotch area was great I was able to use the bathroom with ease and never once wet the shaper.  I disliked the leg part because it kept rolling up and made the suit very uncomfortable also the the shoulder straps need to be longer because they were not long enough it made the shaper uncomfortable in the shoulder area
3.0,Although the product looks good and arrived nicely access glue appearing from where the shoe connects to the soul on the side and round
3.0,The dress was pretty but if you are and ex large get a 2x
3.0,I really love these necklaces and the fact that it came with all the colors you could ask for is a plus but the coloring turns fairly quickly.
3.0,Cut too small
3.0,Beads much smaller than expected. Should be warn with another bracelet
3.0,"It was a cute novelty at first, but after less than a month all both guns and swords have fallen off. It's extremely fragile, so be really gentle with it."
3.0,shipping took way to long but they are nice and I enjoy them.
3.0,its a good watch the only thing is where the watch face connects to the band. the stupid bars kept getting smacked out.
3.0,"I like the look of this band and wear it daily, but the problem is that I sleep with my hands on my face anytime this touches my face, its like chinese handcuffs for my beard hairs (very short scruff).. It instantly pulls and HURTS... For the price point though, it is a good band."
3.0,I like it but not more
3.0,Got these for my husband. To me they are overly big & look absolutely ridiculous.. He likes them but won't wear in public. Idk if they have a smaller lens size?
3.0,to big on top and to tight on bottom
3.0,Not worth the price. Way too long IMO.
3.0,"This fits 12 month to 2 year old. It's very small on my 3 year old, we should have returned."
3.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry. Chain has a kink that I haven't been able to remove. The kink prevents the chain from sliding through the ring. Also very difficult to open.
3.0,"These seemed like they might have been a good product, but they were much bigger than expected! I didn't find the product measurements to be accurate enough to allow me to keep them."
3.0,I didn’t even try the top on but the bottoms fit me at a weird spot and created large bulges around where it laid. I tend to carry weight in hips but by no means am I large it just was not flattering on me
3.0,I like the style the three separate pockets for items but the zipper kept getting stuck in the cloth on the one pouch.  Yesterday it was stuck so much I broke the zipper trying to open it and get the clothe liner out.  And of course my return window closed last week.  I ordered same brand but different style hopefully I do not have the same issue.
3.0,The hat was folded when delivered.  It’s out of shape and too large.
3.0,They are fashionable but don’t stay connected to the pants well. The clasp isn’t sturdy
3.0,"This mask is ok. It fits well and is comfortable. It’s mesh, so easily breathable. I took off 2 stars because it is not very iridescent or sparkly like the pictures. outside in the sunlight it does sparkle, but Inside it just looks very dull. I think they should use better quality/more shiny jewels on it."
3.0,"The dress is cute but it is not how it looks in the picture. It came white instead of cream/tan & it is not silky. Slightly see through but only if you wear bright colored underwear. Still a cute, fun dress thats comfortable! I wore it to a formal dance & people loved it!!"
3.0,It doesn’t work sometimes
3.0,I typically wear a large in shirts & I have big boobs so I ordered this in an XL to be safe and was scared that I would not be able to get it off because it was so tight.
3.0,Thin material but works if you were spanx or something underneath. I bought the white one with pink florals but beware it’s NOT white. It’s a light pink. Not bad though just wish it was actually white
3.0,"Swimsuit is cute but the top and bottom don't match. The top is red, while the bottom is wine. Also I still have glue remnants on the bottom from the sanitary plastic strip, it was very securely attached. Bottoms on the small side. Top fits as expected."
3.0,"I love my masks! The one pictured has multiple spelling errors so i am unable to wear it. The other 2, I dont go anywhere without. Everyone at my office loves them. I would give them 5 stars if I could wear all 3."
3.0,"The sweater fits well (it is long enough both in the waist/hem and sleeves - 5'2' 130lbs). The item said it was white but it is not white. It is off white.<br /> The only disappointment is that it is not white as I had wanted.  I also ordered another turtleneck from another store online that stated it is white and when it arrived it turned out to be off white.  Even the label on the packaging is whiter than the sweater!  As others have noted, you can't tell which is the front or back (I will sew a few stitches in the neck with red thread so that *I* will know which is the back)."
3.0,They are very cute and stylish. The cushion on the inside of nose part fell off within days. So they hurt when I wear them
3.0,A little large but still super cute
3.0,Had a few holes in the material.
3.0,Overall it’s cute and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments! There are a few negatives however; the sleeves are too long and the fabric does not have much breathability so make sure you wear deodorant!
3.0,"Didn't fit my fingers, these are about size 5 or 6. Very cute if you can wear them."
3.0,Disappointed it doesn't have the cut out shoulder. The modeld hair hides that fact. All the other colors do have the cut out so you would assume this one does too! I
3.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; 125lbs & normally wear a size 4 Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda jeans but I had to order a 12 in this brand which is really strange. I am unable to find washing instructions and I have no idea if these are cotton or a cotton poly blend. The waist is an inch too big.  because of this, the bottom sags.  Even with a tight belt I have to continually pull them up because they slowly slip down.  Luckily, the tight tight legs keep them from falling all the way down.  But I have washed them so I think I have to keep them."
3.0,It's very comfortable.  Great for hot weather and casual clothing.  Elastic waistband could be more durable.  I would give it a 4 star if it was more durable.  Runs on the short side.
3.0,Very nice. Good quality and very comfortable. But they fade very fast mine is almost faded away. So if there are other types that last longer I would like to find them please
3.0,Ordered a size 5 & 10 for my daughters to match as flower girls. The size 5 fits perfectly and the length is just right. The size 10 is super short on her and makes her look like a cupcake (not the look we were hoping for). Wish it were longer and then it would be perfect. Ours came with sashes. Probably going to return them and find something else.
3.0,"It's an over all good mask, comfortable and light but it says it has a breathing valve and it does not. The piece does not open or close. I think it's just for show"
3.0,I love the bottom they fit perfect but the top runs too small
3.0,SMELLED SO WEIRD<br />pockets make my hips looks awkward...<br />Straps aren’t long enough even though adjustable<br /><br />I kept it to be a “house dress” that I can lounge around in.
3.0,it's okay! not as expected :/
3.0,I thought I would sweat more but I didn't
3.0,It’s reasonable for the price.
3.0,My 5 month old German Shepherd tore them up after 3 days of playing with me with these on my hands and arms.
3.0,"Wash it on delicate cycle with no spinning. Do not tumble dry! I’m 5.7, 165 pounds, size XL good for me. Shrunk!"
3.0,It’s okay but my wrist is smaller and it’s big for me
3.0,"These are so incredibly comfortable, ordered two to begin with, just ordered three more pair in a different color. These are literally the softest articles of clothing that have ever touched my skin!!!<br /><br />***EDIT<br />Both pair of pants have developed holes in the crotch area; I always wash on gentle cycle and I've only had them for a short while. So sad :("
3.0,Ordered a large since I am a size 8. Was too loose at the top and center. I returned for a medium-which its great due to the stretch in the fabric.
3.0,A well made leather bag but did not meet the beauty of what I have come to expect from a Brahmin handbag. The handbag was quite wider and bulkier than what I was wanting.
3.0,It's cute enough for a quick &#34;throw on&#34; summer outfit; fit's slightly too large.
3.0,fits true to size on top half.. loose on the bottom whole leg area is loos fitting specially around thigh area.. will return don't want to pay for alterations :(
3.0,Faded after 1st wash but great material.
3.0,"This is a pretty umbrella, easy to &#34;tote&#34; around because of it's small size. However the one I received does not Auto Close as advertised, although Auto Open works just fine."
3.0,Like this fashion
3.0,"Very cute top and fits well, but its super see through. The material is not cotton, its that stretchy, almost work out like material."
3.0,very cheap buttons came falling off
3.0,They sent the wrong sad cause it is a super cute print need to send it back for the right size ugh!
3.0,Has a orange hue copperish look.
3.0,"The shirt is of good quality, however the sizing was ridiculous.  I wear an XLT but this thing was gigantic. Something tells me that if I got a regular XL it would be a belly shirt."
3.0,"I returned it because it was too large, otherwise good quality."
3.0,was lookind for a little heavier jacket
3.0,Came with a hard fold from shipping that I'm sure will eventually smooth out. I have a larger head and was too small for me. For a cheap hat and if you have a medium size head this hat would probably be perfect
3.0,"The watch is extremely tiny.  I knew it was small before I bought it, but I thought I might wear it anyway.  I am not a huge guy and from lug to lug it maybe covers half the top of my wrist, which is just way too small."
3.0,Just too bulky
3.0,Ordered larger size and they were a little tight but fit around legs were good!!!
3.0,"I admit, I'm a major Star Wars fan, have been from the beginning. Am thrilled that I now have a full bracelet of Star Wars charms and was ecstatic about this charm. I've now had to buy it twice and it's already on it's last wing. :( It catches, bends, and breaks easily. It is killing me that I had to take it off my Star Wars Bracelet. I don't wear my Star Wars Bracelet to bed, to shower, or as daily piece, mostly because I want it to last. But this charm is making it really sad, because I wanted the tie fighter on my wrist. :("
3.0,"It is lightweight but does not hold a constant comfortable shape. Constantly adjusting the C-mono to attempt a non cumbersome shape, but to no avail. Finally replaced with the Costa silicone retainer which is MUCH better.  Silicone lays better and is also lightweight."
3.0,Their okay don't expect something big
3.0,I like these shorts. However the draw string is way too long. It’s a very thick a hoe lace. It’s a significant bulge that rubs against my man parts. I had to fold the elastic out to have the draw string outside my shorts. I’d buy another pair IF they fix the drawstring.
3.0,Too bulky.  I didn't even take it on my European trip because it's like stacking 5 passports.
3.0,Daughter loved the bright flower colors
3.0,Fit is odd.  I should have returned it right away.
3.0,Buy a size up in the cup size
3.0,Super see through and not worth your money
3.0,Material is great I wish band was slightly smaller I don't have enough hair for pony tail so it goes on weird. I pull it down to my neck and push up and it's a little weird but not as bad when I pull down over my forehead.<br />sorry if this is confusing but I will keep it and use kayaking.
3.0,"Great fit, received with hole in bottom portion."
3.0,"These are adorable shorts and I'd love to wear them in public, but only if you couldn't see straight through them. I bought them in the light pink, so maybe that is the reason. It's too bad they don't have a lining."
3.0,"This is a very cool looking watch, but the hands are very difficult to see. The black on black is not the best combo.<br /><br />Other than that, I do like it."
3.0,"It is a very nice dress, but it wasn't true to size."
3.0,"The dress fits well, good length, I like the sleeves, but the material is just not nice at all.  Wore it on a cross country flight and it was very uncomfortable. Hard to describe.  Maybe best description is it feels stiff and thick…"
3.0,Sleeves way to short by about 2 inches.
3.0,Size is good and slots work great.  Hard to put cash back into wallet quickly.  Takes a bit of time.
3.0,I was really hoping to love this and bought this as a relatively pricey gift to myself to make postpartum recovery easier. While I ordered XL - in line with my size and fit for other postpartum products this XL is the size of XL for someone not postpartum and does not account for the abdominal distention that is still present following giving birth. With it being high waisted I feel like I am being corseted. It is also rougher and less absorb than disposable postpartum cotton pads. Ouch.
3.0,Very cheap material 😞
3.0,I'm an XL and had to return and get and XXL and it's still not quite an XL. But I'm living with it. Otherwise it's good quality.
3.0,Cute but turns fast
3.0,"The V neck cut was off, one side was longer than the other and I needed to pin it in order for it to stay and lay right"
3.0,"I normally wear a size 10. They said order 1.5 sizes larger. Since they don’t sell half sizes, I ordered a size 12.<br />Way too big. An 11 would have worked.<br /><br />I’m keeping them and flopping around....too expensive to ship back, considering the price."
3.0,diaper bag is orrfect size. I like that we you use it multiple  ways.  material is easy to clean
3.0,"I bought some kukui nut leis in Hawaii during my honeymoon many years back. They were a nice large size and fairly heavy. This one does not look or feel the same. Unfortunately I got rid of the ones I bought and needed to buy a new one for a graduation. This one is very shiny and lightweight. It will serve its purpose, but I’m a bit disappointed by it. The picture someone posted of the label that says it was made in China is exactly the same that I received. I will have to wait until the next time I go to Hawaii to get another lei."
3.0,"The fabric is weird, kinda a mix between a towel and swimsuit material. I was hoping as a smaller chested lady this would make my goodies look a little bigger but they dont. Comfy but not sure if I will be keeping it or not. Got it when it was half off so for $12 it can't be that bad."
3.0,"3 stars for size. It's too small. I returned it.<br />Size Chart says 3X should fit at 50-52&#34; bust.  I measured the back just under the arms and it's 20&#34; , the sides are 14&#34; .. that's 48&#34;. .  The back needs to be 22 inches. It stretches, but I like my covers to flow.. not be tight across my butt. A 4X would do it, but I'm afraid it's still going to be too small, then a 5X the arms are way too long!  If you like things flowing.. order larger.<br />Just because the material stretches, doesn't mean you want it to stretch to fit. The arms are not tight. just across the back.<br />The material is Spandex and it's nice to the touch. flows and hangs ok.. if it was just a bit bigger so it loosely flows around me. It's just too tight.<br />The biege color is more taupe or sand. It's thin, like thick underwear."
3.0,One came broken and when I wear one of them it gets tangled because the chains are not set right. Giving this three stars because I am only able to wear 3 of the 5
3.0,Very cute but the shirt itself seems small and the sleeves are too long.
3.0,"First off I wear boxer briefs.  When I grew up you either wore boxers (usually made out of cotton with no elastic) or you wore briefs (spun cotton that gave you support).  When they combined the two, I was in hog heaven.  The comfort of a boxer but the support of a brief  This is how I base my review and taking into consideration cost.<br />First off, as many have noted, this does not have a fly front (Y front for the Brits).  This is nice for obvious reasons.<br />The fabric is very thin so it does not give much support.<br />As the fabric is mostly polyester, it should last but the  briefs will probably loose even more shape.<br />The one good thing is the price at $5 which is about what they are worth.  I will probably stick to better known brands and wait for the Black Friday sales where I  can get a much better product at about double the cost."
3.0,If your kiddo has thick glasses these won’t work. It’s hard to get them on the glasses even though it say “thick glasses are okay”
3.0,"Although this is a good idea, there are no colorful crystal rhinestones. The ring has a green color to all of the feather parts and I can't tell where the head is as there is no distinction at all.  Guess you truly do get what you pay for.  Will wear it during the week, but not for any weekend or dress affairs."
3.0,"I ordered a size L and got a 2XL?<br />It fits a bit loose when I wanted it to be snugged on me, this is for a costume so I have no time to return it and get a smaller size.<br />The material is great and it's pretty thick and comfortable, just wish I got the size I ordered then I would've given it 5 stars."
3.0,Can't unclamp the bracelet off my wrist pls help
3.0,I like the style and the bottoms fit well and are faltering to the body. However I am a busty woman and the top is WAY too small do NOT listen to other reviews that say the top fits fine because it doesn't I will modifying the top to fit better. Over all it is a cute bathing suit and if I had known the top was small I would have bought the next size up.
3.0,"Looked pretty, fit everywhere by across my back and I wear a size small 3/4. And I am not busty. So I returned and I am awaiting my new dress"
3.0,"This dress is gigantic! I was expecting a loose fit, but I am swimming in fabric and it’s below my knees. For reference: I am 4’11” and weigh 95 pounds. The color and fabric are nice, as are the arms and the chest and neck fit well (32 A bra), but the rest of it is a hard no. I wanted a swingy dress, so belting it would negate that swingy style. This would work on someone taller or with a much larger chest to pull the dress up a few inches."
3.0,"I ordered a large, even though I normally wear a medium. This shirt was very short, it barely comes down past my belly button. I love the feel of the fabric and the design is cute, but if I can't find a way to stretch the fabric, I'm giving it to my mom (who is smaller than me)."
3.0,I bought the tigers eye. They are glad and very pretty but they are pretty darn heavy. Heavy enough to aggravate my minor Carpol tunnel on my wrist.
3.0,I do love the detail of this and will keep it. However I had to drop my rating because as you can see in the pic its busted in 5 months. I carry nothing but money and cc and reward cards in it. It's great if u aren't gonna carry change etc in it. Or for a keepsake.
3.0,These sizes are definitely small.  Im 6' 190 lbs and the large wasn't even close to being a large.  Unfortunately large is the biggest size they make.  Jacket is nice and stylish and I would buy it if they had a bigger size.
3.0,Quality doesnt look like what's in the picture
3.0,I love the fit and style. Really gives the hour glass shape illusion. It didn't wash well. Fabric is already pilling and looks like it is covered in snags. I washed in a lingerie bag but it didn't help. I always wash new items in lingerie bags because the quality of the fabric is not always known at time of purchase.
3.0,Was way too small and complicated to put on! Has no support
3.0,The material is thin and fairly see-through. Maybe I'm spoiled by my Simier Fariry tops that are super soft but this material felt a little too &#34;hard&#34; for me.  Also it didnt lay on my body the way I expected and the sleeves were a little too tight for my liking as well.  Sizing seemed right though.  Also the Buttons dont actually button.... so that's a little weird.  Had to send this one back.
3.0,The piece was very pretty I loved it but stones fell out probably the first two or three weeks I had it
3.0,Not too impressed with the scarf which was very thin and wrinkled. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone.
3.0,I purchased this clear bag to use at work. I love the ease and comfort of it and receive a lot of compliments from co worker.  The down side is the strap separates from the vinyl. This is my second bag purchase and each time the bag separated in the same place each time.
3.0,I wanted to love this necklace because the price is very reasonable and the style is what I’m looking for. But I received a necklace with a broken clasp. So sad I have to return it!
3.0,Very nice hat. I love the design and the thickness of the hat. It will be warm for winter. But ITS TOO SMALL!! I have an average size head and it just wants to slide up and off. It gives me a headache if I wear it too long. I'm trying to stretch it out a bit so I can enjoy it because I do love it.
3.0,"I'll use as a overnight bag, very flimsy. Does not. Stand up with shape and form like the picture."
3.0,"I intended to use this for a phone or remote for a tripod. These were way to big. Make sure to look at the measurements. It's hard to tell from the photo. Otherwise, they seemed fine."
3.0,"I'm going to give this a 3-star, only because when I brought it out of the bag, the pant leg part were sewn together, giving me a little hole to put my leg in. I ripped it all the way to the end and hemmed it. looks better with my alterations."
3.0,"Frame is too weak, only used it 5 times and it broke up almost from nothing you get what you paid for"
3.0,I’m not sure if I got the correct size...or is my 7 year olds head huge? Lol I ordered 4-10 yrs but it’s really hard for her to get over her head. I’m wondering if we were sent the toddler size. . I like the fabric and how thin it is. But I have to return them.
3.0,They’re okay.  Expected a lightweight cargo short for hiking but The fabric is heavier than I associate with relaxed fit and wouldn’t be comfortable in the heat we get in Palm Springs
3.0,Color described as “hibiscus”. No mention of the dots. Not what I expected as I have ordered these in black and in blue and they were solid. Not just a few dots either - a dense pattern of dots. Will affect what they are paired with.
3.0,"I was somewhat disappointed in the material and construction.  The arms are somewhat tight fitting, but there is plenty of room in the body of the cardigan.  Not my favorite piece."
3.0,Smaller than I thought. Stretched and fit well only because I wore it under a dress. Would not recommend wearing solo.
3.0,Bought this for my mom. The string its on broke not long after. We put it on another string (the holes are small) but it broke too. My mom just keeps the rocks in a little case in her room now.
3.0,Great color. Just not flattering. Looks like it is”trying to hard.”
3.0,These served their purpose for one small season (8 weeks). However they fell apart. I will pay more for higher end next time.
3.0,"My earrings are flat, showing the front of the TARDIS, not the corner like the photo."
3.0,I think they need to indicate max shoe size of 8.5.  I wear a nine and these socks before washing would not stay on my heels.
3.0,Hat was stained.
3.0,"So, I LOVE the look of this dress. I have actually bought two of them... in a Large and a Medium... and they're both a little too large and boxy. I do have a larger chest... and it just hangs and makes me look much larger than I really am. The good news: The embroidered part is actually really nice and the material is perfect for a throw-in-the-bag and travel dress. I'm debating trying a small (even though I'm normally a size 10/12)... I really hope I can get this dress to work!"
3.0,"It's very comfortable but sizing is off. Light-weight cotton blend material that drapes nicely. I'm a size-8-10 5'6 and ordered a medium and it was too small and ended up giving to my daughter.  I took other reviewer's advice and went large, XLarge, and fit perfectly."
3.0,"When I ordered it, I didn’t realize that it wasn’t a scoop neck crop top. I didn’t like how it was so high up my neck, but it was inexpensive so I’m ok with it."
3.0,Had to return because material very thin. Could see through material.
3.0,"Other reviewers taller than I am said it was long, and at 6’ myself it doesn’t come to my ankles. The straps are wider than pictured, and the neckline higher. There is no shape to this dress. I belted it to make it look less like a tent but honestly it still looks really frumpy. Disappointed."
3.0,"Super cute shirt but it runs big! The sleeves are very long too, they went down passed my elbows"
3.0,The print is somewhat faded and the shirt seems really small for the size I ordered. It works for a kid but if I had purchased it for myself 'd have to return it.
3.0,Not actually white ! They have a little grayish blue tint . I’m not happy with the color!!
3.0,It’s not the material I thought it was. I thought it was gonna be a sweatshirt material but it’s like a parachute material...? It’s comfy but I don’t really prefer the material
3.0,"These seem like decent riding glasses, but when they say oversized, they mean it! Too large for my head and eyes so I can't use them."
3.0,If you do not have big hips then this is not worth ordering. I have a very small waist and this was huge on me! The look of it is beautiful but the size is much too big!
3.0,GOOD SPECS JUST LIKE NO LINES BUT THEY DIDNT GET THE TRANSISTION PART WILL NOT GET DARK AS ADVERTISED WILL BUY AGAIN THOUGH CAN SEE GOOD
3.0,"Almost kind of wished I would have paid a little more attention to detail. The picture makes them look a little longer, thicker and made out of better material.  Definitely not!"
3.0,"Theyook nice. But aren't up to my hubby's standards when it comes to ties, he likes the name brand and quality you get from them and he jus didn't get that with these."
3.0,I would order larger than you need. It’s cute but doesn’t hang as the photo shows.
3.0,NOT KID SIZED!!  Definitely made for Adults!  But they work for what they are needed for.... We will still use them.
3.0,"it's a very cute shirt but once again I am disappointed in sellers misrepresenting their product.  It's huge!  And the material is that weird stat-icky polyester.  If you do order this shirt order a size that is at least 2 sizes smaller than you usually order.  That being said, it is cute but the material was not for me and it's runs large."
3.0,The upper part of the slippers is too loose to wear so they slip off. They're just not proportionate to the rest of the slipper.
3.0,Good quality but didnt fit on the backs of any of my earrings.
3.0,I wear a medium and spandex and the pants to this outfit fit baggy 🤦🏽‍♀️
3.0,Good value though.
3.0,It's fit good looks nice but when you start moving around it rolls up annoying I don't wear anymore
3.0,"Shirt fits well, and is comfortable. I’ve washed about 3 times now and the print hasn’t faded yet but does look like it will begin to fade soon."
3.0,I bought this for my son. The shirt was cute and good quality. Unfortunately it is ridiculously small. We ordered 2 sizes bigger than he normally wears based on other reviews and he couldn't even get it on! This runs super small.
3.0,"They look cool but they're way too big. Would not purchase again. Not a fan of the material either though to be honest, with the inserts, they're probably more effective then the masks most everyone is wearing."
3.0,"The bottom band is oddly constricting, but the pattern is nice and the fabric feel is excellent.  May modify to avoid weird outline."
3.0,"The product was exactly as described and fit nicely. My son didn’t really like wearing them, unfortunately. Not really sure why, but he kicks them off after a few minutes. Oh well."
3.0,"I bought two separate pairs of Aegend goggles back in January. I swim a couple of days a week, and knew that if I didn't like them my kids could use them this summer. Well, this pair is super comfortable, just like the other pair I have.<br /> unfortunately they have a design flaw which makes them unusable. The problem is with the nose piece. It snaps out of place regularly, and while it's plenty easy to reattach it, it'll snap out again immediately. By the way, I've never used them. The problem manifested when I gave them to my son to use this summer, as planned. He has not handeled them aggressively or badly. It's just a weakness in the design imo. I'll never replace the other pair (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JHTRJF4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), as they are THE MOST comfortable goggles I've ever had, and do a fantastic job."
3.0,"Very nice shorts, but sized small! Size up!"
3.0,The dress is pretty however the fabric is very cheap and when you put it on it starts stretching to the point where the color fades out and it is very thin. I will be returning it.
3.0,I would give it a 5 star because it’s very aesthetically pleasing BUT it’s tiny. I have to wear it on the last buckle and feels really tight. I’m 5’4 and 150.
3.0,Not the material I was expecting though<br />But I like it fit nicely
3.0,"Looks fantastic for the price, not expecting it to last many years, but paid $20, as long as it lasts 1 year it totally paid for itself."
3.0,I couldn't figure out how they were supposed to work
3.0,They are super thin and see through
3.0,"I’m typically an extra large 16/18 in clothing and am a bit busty. I order the 2xl as I wanted something that would fit and have a little room. The jacket was so small I couldn’t zip it. I’ve lost a few pounds and can  now zip the coat, but it is not well fitting by any standard. I’m scared to move my arms when trying it on. I will be keeping it since I plan to continue losing weight but I would say it’s off by 2 sizes. I would say it fits similarly to a large size in other jackets and sweatshirts that I’ve owned. I think once it fits properly it will be a nice backup layer to keep in my car"
3.0,Didn't use this as much as I thought I would. There is a part of the plastic that hangs over a little and it you get it close to your eye it will scrap it. So it's hard to blend around your eye.
3.0,"A bit too long, bought for my daughter but she cant use it."
3.0,These aren't exactly square which makes them annoying to fold and they don't fit correctly.
3.0,Needs a little more flair at the bottom.
3.0,Doesn't have any instructions. Have to guess at what to use where. Needs directions for use.
3.0,This is a large heavy watch. I don't wear it much.
3.0,Eehhhh.. super tight not as I expected.. don’t know if I’d buy again..
3.0,The detail and packaging is nice but it was extremely embarrassing when I gifted it as it fell apart once it was opened the pendant came right off
3.0,Not what you think you are getting! The style of the dress is great but it looks inside out which would be fun and different except the stitching is not seamless enough to seat that way. I'm going to actually wear it inside out!
3.0,"The buttons have to be replaced as they are the cheapest plastic you can buy and the shade of red is not the correct color for the garment.,"
3.0,"I was so excited to give this to my husband. He was excited to receive it. However, once it was washed it shrunk horribly. I am so disappointed."
3.0,"I ordered this dress for an event my husband has at work this week. First of all, I have to say the dress came on time as I used Amazon prime. I like the dress really well, it looks exactly how it looks online. I am 33 weeks pregnant and my pre-pregnant weight was 120 lbs and My pre pregnant size was a small. Now with the pregnancy, I weigh 149 lbs so now I wear a medium. I ordered a size medium in this dress. However, when I tried the dress on , I couldn't get the zipper to zip through the back. Mind you, the dress was not tight at all, it fits perfectly but I just couldn't get the zipper to zip through. It was very frustrating. So for this reason, I have to unfortunately return the dress..also the dress was really long and I was scared I would fall walking or something."
3.0,"At it's price point, i really am extremely impressed with these...<br />Extremely quiet with excellent Japanese motor to booth compared to Orbita (above $400)<br />Unequivocally, the best watch winder under $300.<br />On the negative side, these REALLY  should come with a battery compartment inbuilt.<br />Secondly and more importantly Brookstone  customer service is really not topnotch unfortunately.<br />Highly recommended!<br />UPDATE 12/07/18<br />Watch winder is beginning to show its real value as my expensive Omega watches are running 5 minutes inaccurate.<br />Consequently, i shall remove 2 stars from my earlier review and retract my highly recommended assertion, unfortunately."
3.0,"Cute top but stretch very shiny, cheap  looking material.. threads already loose"
3.0,The dress is so flattering and looks great. It’s very tight in the arms and there’s no give to the fabric. My sleeve ripped at the shoulder seem trying to get the dress off. It may be different if you size up. Super adorable though
3.0,Nice bag but I needed white and this is beige. Sent it back.
3.0,These charms are not 16mm x 19mm as advertised. They measure 11mm x 14mm
3.0,"This chain &#34;just looked CHEAP&#34; even though the links appeared to be silver soldered closed so should have been safe. The cheap appearance resulted from: a) the final plating appearing to have been applied by some sort of a continuous drag through plating process where the trailing edge of each link seemed to have a residual tail on it; & b) the links seemed large & more gaudy than a longer 3.5 chain I already own. I'm likely wrong about my observations, but I ended up spending 50% more for an upscale item. Likely, a) I didn't know what a quality sterling silver chain costs these days; &, b) I was trying to duplicate the &#34;look&#34; of a chain I had but in a shorter length."
3.0,"These run a little small, not so surprising and I probably should have followed some of the other reviewers advice and ordered up a size.  What was surprising is that the neck opening is very small.  It is so high that it is a little uncomfortable.  It is not as pictured, at least not on the 2 dresses I purchased.  The pockets don't lay flat so, make the ol' hips look that much bigger.  On the positive side, the fabric is a nice weight and the prints are beautiful.  The length is exactly what I was looking for.  I am 5'8"" and  it his just a hair above my knee cap.  Unfortunately, I can't deal with the high neck so, they are going back."
3.0,Probably perfect for a someone taller than me or whose image is consistent with larger jewelry.
3.0,Great errings but broke after a few wears.
3.0,My son is 25lbs 2 toddler so he needs a small I got an extra extra small which was way to small. The shirt fits very tight so make sure you measure before purchasing because you may need to go a size up.
3.0,pom pom came off
3.0,"I think it was semi- comfortable. It wasn’t great, so I decided to order from another seller on Amazon. Quality wasn’t great, and it was way too large."
3.0,"Ran a little small,but for the price was ok"
3.0,"Good quality, on the bigger size"
3.0,The bust area fits perfectly! But the waist fits tight!
3.0,Quality of shirt is poor. Would not buy again.
3.0,"Chain could be longer, it felt like a choker. Changed chains so I could wear it. The charm is smaller than expected, but very cute."
3.0,Sensible design.  More conservative than my usual.
3.0,"takes some effort to close, but its sturdy"
3.0,I didn’t like that material
3.0,These are just okay. They are a little tighter than I like and I'm not a fan of the length. I thought I would like having longer shirts so my rear end stays concealed when I bend over (which is often because I am a preschool teacher) but they ride up (probably because they are on the tight side) and I find myself having to adjust often. The fabric is not soft and the adjustable straps adjust in the front instead of the back which I have never seen before. I'm afraid that when I wash them they will shrink and no longer fit. If I had seen these in a store I would not have purchased them.
3.0,"It fitted perfectly. except the part that holds the strap in brought the other day only had it for a month. thats why i gave it a 3 star only, color is great and fits on the fitbit as it states."
3.0,"I really liked the pattern and the fabric of this pajamas set. My only issue is that it did not fit me up top. Generally speaking I'm a size medium. This being said, bottoms fit fine - shorts weren't too short. Top was the only issue for me. I am rather busty, I wear a DD or DDD usually, so this made me have to send it back."
3.0,I read the reviews saying it was a small fit so I bought a larger one. It was still too small which is a shame because it was so soft.
3.0,They were too small and just not my type.
3.0,After two washings (inside out on delicate) the material pilled. Weak fibers.
3.0,"I love the bottoms, fit perfect and are super cute on. I am a 38 D, so I thought if I ordered the next size up from what I normally am (a large in tops &amp; bottoms) it would be just fine. The bottoms fit perfect, but the top is just trashy looking one me. I will be purchasing a new top and getting rid of this one, but the bottoms are really cute."
3.0,"Cute, but too big. She will have to grow into it."
3.0,Good shoes. Fit perfectly and the kid loves them. However one shoe stopped working completely just after a few times and the other one has only blue color left. Probably got a defective pair.
3.0,Welcome to the 3lb belt buckle experience. This thing is heavy even before I holster my beer in it. Might be able to stop a speeding bullet.
3.0,"I ordered the top in Red and received Rose Red. It arrived one day early, is a beautiful top and fit well. However, I needed a red top for an event so I sent it back."
3.0,Beautiful dress ordered  3xl and i wear regular xl because i have a bust. unfortunately it would not zip up the lace is not sretch and the arms have a tight stitch ordered the 3plus i did rather adjust it. Quality is goood and heavy for the price
3.0,The style didn't suit me but my cousin wears it well.
3.0,I have a 28 in rib cage and this was wayyy to small.  Unless you wear an XS in tops it will likely be very tight.
3.0,"Very nice bracelet, nice look and detailed, but while putting on a t-shirt the lion charm got separated from the rivet holding it to the bracelet, it was nice for the 3 days before it broke"
3.0,Fall down. Very baggy. So cute. She will have to wait untill she is over 2 for them to fit
3.0,Bags are fine. Best priced multi-pack I could find online.
3.0,"good material, odd proportion"
3.0,"These are decent earrings. They are cute, and I thought that they would look good with a matching red lip and a white off-should top for the summer. For the most part I am satisfied, but I do have a couple issues with them. It says they are around 8.5cm which is about 3.346 inches. I measured these at around 2 inches though. I also noticed that one is just slightly longer than the other. I will try to remove one of the rings to even them out. They are lightweight and comfortable. They come with the regular metal backings but they also included two sets of those rubber backings, as well, which I liked. I think the color is pretty close to the color in the pictures advertised."
3.0,"Super soft material, cute cut, but the xl top is very short and wide."
3.0,I like it but it's different from the previous one I ordered. I really like the tan one so I ordered two more colors and they're different. I took off two stars because they're a different material and smaller.
3.0,"Beautiful print but if you have hips and thighs this isn't meant for you. Mine fit perfectly up too, and in my mid section however was very tight on my hips and things. I recommend going a size bigger. I'm 5'3&quot; 150lb 34D and I ordered a Medium."
3.0,"These are fine, but the brown definitely isn't a true brown.  The ones I received although labeled &#34;brown&#34;, match the picture of the &#34;tan&#34; much better.  &#34;Dark beige&#34; or &#34;sand&#34; colored would be a better name. I've bought iLoveSIA sandals before and those were brown when it said and showed brown.  Disappointed, but not worth sending back.  Good quality otherwise."
3.0,"I ordered two separate rompers, one my size (this one) and one larger (size large). This one runs extremely small. I am a size 2 and small and this was so far up me when I put it on, I could barely fit and literally everything was hanging out and it was very uncomfortable. If you are going to buy this, I would definitely recommend sizing up and knowing that it doesn't provide much coverage at all. I think this would be great as a swimsuit cover to the beach or pool. It does look exactly like the picture as far as colors go and it is very lightweight so it would make a great outfit for hot or summer weather so that's what I would recommend it for.<br /><br />I rely on Amazon reviews for all my purchases, regardless of where I end up making my purchase. I also understand the importance of accuracy regarding reviews. It is my objective to help others in making an informed, educated buying decision. That being said, I did received this product at a discount in an exchange of my review. This opinion is all my own and I do not gain anything from leaving a positive review and lose nothing by leaving a negative one."
3.0,It’s cute but in the photos the colors look pastel but in fact it’s a dark green and dark gold color. I thought it was going to be a pastel yellow and mint green.
3.0,I gave these three stars because the socks are cute but the bow is glued on poorly instead of stitched. They came off after one wear
3.0,"Cute dress, the material was okay but the neckline was too big."
3.0,"Just a weird fit across my back and I'm not broad shouldered. For what I paid, I will donate it."
3.0,The rings are nice quality but they're all to big to be midi rings for me.
3.0,Be sure to get 1 or 2 sizes larger than usual.
3.0,"Mixed review here. The overalls looked and felt exactly as I wanted, except these were wide enough for TWO of me. So large they were awkward to walk in and I could never have used them for gardening. Point of reference I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 140#. I returned them."
3.0,"Awesome hoodie for your little boy, or little girl. It is a very soft hoodie and very light not heavy at all. I'm very happy with it but the ad is very confusing, you think you're getting too hoodies for the price but you're not you're only getting one it does not say that you're only getting one by what the picture shows you're getting to. I thought the hoodie was a little expensive, for just one. I was under the assumption I was getting two. But the sweatshirt is very colorful and fits my nephew perfectly."
3.0,I like the charms but I was very disappointed in the bracelet part.  It is much to lard for the charms.
3.0,i love this shirt .very casual look but nice enough for work. Fits great every where except the arm sleeves . they are just to tight.
3.0,"Material isn’t the best, easy to wrinkle and the silhouette is a little weird at the top"
3.0,"The functionality of the shades is bad. First time  changing lenses is soo dang hard to do, like it's child proof or something. But after you do it once or twice it gets easier to do. It also loses points for only one, that's right only one out of five lenses are polarized. Bad move. The good part is that it fits nicely on my face and looks cool. And comes in a nice case. I would only recommended on a case by case bases or if it's on a sale for $10 or less."
3.0,It's a lot thicker than I wanted for the caribbean
3.0,The jeans are good the only problem I had is that the belt buckle broke after the first wear
3.0,"Came all ''disfigured'' took awhile to ''mold'' back into shape , otherwise good hat.."
3.0,"These are gorgeous but way too large to be used a charm for a bracelet, etc.  The size are a little over 2 inches tall, so they weren't suitable to hang from a bracelet or a beaded pen as I had intended."
3.0,It’s very comfortable dress but unfortunately I need to exchange it and get a large.
3.0,Gold coverings on each end fell off.
3.0,It's cute but I honestly feel like a clown in it :/ it fits a little large so order a size smaller.
3.0,"runs really small, but looks great and works as a cycling jersey"
3.0,"Took two stars off because one of the ear loops BARELY gets sewn together.  I ordered 3 packages of these type of masks in different styles. That's 24 masks. Not a single one I ordered had both ear loops sewn properly. One ear loop just gets ends sewn together to make a loop for the ear.<br /><br />I had to sew EVERY single mask at those end pieces to make the loop and actual loop and to make the ear loop stay together so it won't rip and break apart upon first usage. Would have sent back, but family needed masks now. Took forever to sew each ear loop properly, and I shouldn't have had to.<br /><br />Lovely masks, but poor sewing and product design. I'd give it 5 stars if both ear loops were ACTUAL loops, not just a one with the ends poorly sewn together."
3.0,"I purchased this to wear as an under shirt for a see through top I have. It is barely long enough to tuck in. In fact, if you raise your arms it untucks."
3.0,"I bought this swimsuit in hopes of finding a semi-cute mom suit. It’s just okay. The bottom fits loose compared to the top of the suit, so I felt like I was constantly fixing it. It’s still cute than many modest suits out there and I like that it’s an attached romper style instead of two pieces. I think I’ll wear this occasionally, but it won’t be my go-to."
3.0,Most knots have come undone
3.0,Seem like a nice shirt. I listened to the reviews and brought a x-large. The shirt was swiming on me. Looks like it runs true to size. Returning for a medium. Im 5'4 124 pounds. A size bust line slim frame.
3.0,love the color and style but the bust runs much larger than the bottom
3.0,The one on the left I got for 7 bucks. The one on the right is this purchase. It’s the exact same coin in every way and did not come in a white case as pictured. Just save yourself the money and wait and find the cheaper version of this coin.  As screen accurate goes the pictures are fantastic. But this coin is about as big as a half dollar and weighs like a silver dollar. Great coin. Just don’t pay double the price for when you can get the same for cheaper
3.0,"I like the design and my kiddo is definitely on the smaller end of the 3T spectrum but I don't expect her to be able to fit into this dress anytime soon.  It's too big around and far too long for a kid's summer dress.  The design is cute, I tried washing it to shrink it but no such luck.  Order a size down perhaps?"
3.0,"Not as soft & cozy as it looks online. Scratchy & runs big. Ordered a medium for a gift., Gave to someone who wears 2x & it fits them."
3.0,Nothing exceptional. bought for an old person with bad vision - and she was happy.
3.0,Super cute shirt and nice material but size is NOT true to fit! My 3x fit more like an XL!
3.0,"We brought this for a large gathering of 40+ people.  Thought the idea was cute - (a) Great conversation starter, and (b) Would work as a way for our guests to tell their glass from that of another.<br /><br />The quality of these stickers is fantastic.  They are easy to peel off the sheet, and stick onto the glasses.  Even taking them off the glasses is very easy.  It leaves no residue.  But the pen/marker it came with, did not work well at all.  The tip was quite thick, so you could barely fit a phrase on the sticker.  And just within 3-4 uses, it ran out of ink.<br /><br />If only the quality of the pen/marker could be improved upon, then this product would be a hit at every party.  Other than the disappointment of the pen, I absolutely loved it!"
3.0,"my husband likes the fitting of this underwear but the material is not good. After couple washes, there are tiny reap and tear here and there."
3.0,"The picture of this item is inaccurate. The slit doesn't start up above the hip (as pictured), it starts much lower and makes the shirt look much more like a dress."
3.0,"These are okay for the price, but I also bought some slightly thicker ones that are much nicer.  Also, the seam tends to rotate when you wash these."
3.0,"These are extremely beautiful, but the broke, the golden centerpiece fell off, the same day I used them for the first time."
3.0,I got the wrong colors and it was poorly packaged. I do have to say that the underwear fits great. It does tend to ride up though. I contacted the seller about how i received the completely wrong colors and they gave me my money back. Overall the product is good.
3.0,"3 stars because for the price they are great!<br />That being said, one of the 2 we ordered had an extra seam in it and drastically reduced space for head... I carefully removed stitching w seam ripper and it was fine. Red band is not elastic and is not a snug fit especially to a child's head and is does fall off."
3.0,good buy but some bigger than expected..
3.0,"It was a gift - the receiver really liked how it looked.  However, after 2 days it turned her neck green and gave her contact dermatitis where the pendant sat on her neck."
3.0,Way too long. I’m 5 foot so I’m used to things needing some work but this is crazy long.
3.0,it ran a little too small but its ok
3.0,"These aren't seamless. There is a seam on the inside of each leg (expected), but then also 2 seams down the front and back of the top from the crotch. Also, the top bunches up and doesn't lay flat with the band.<br /><br />Very soft. Not see through. Kind of long. Returning due to awkward crotch seams."
3.0,Quality was not what I expected
3.0,These are huge. The pink is a great color.
3.0,Was really pretty but the clasp came off really easily
3.0,The bands are good it's just that the white brand name is kinda testy.
3.0,These aren’t very soft. They run a little small but they are functional.
3.0,"Cute shoes but the smell is terrible even after owning for several months! They hang in a mesh shoe organizer in my daughters room and you can still smell them after leaving them open to air since purchase.  The button is a little flimsy and likes to come loose.  I bought 3 pairs in Cinderella, Snow White and Ariel.  I would not purchase again due to the smell that lingers forever."
3.0,The dress is cute but it was entirely too big for me in all areas. Even though the measurements are usually my measurements it was off in all areas.
3.0,I was not crazy about the material of this dress. It fits well but did not look good on me.
3.0,"Great color. Runs a bit snall, and the interlock buckle tends to snap apart."
3.0,The socks ride down and slip off the heel if your shoes are the slightest bit loose or roomy on your feet. Can only wear with shoes that already fit tightly.
3.0,"The bead decoration of this dress  is what first caught my eye.  I'm not an orange/rust color fan usually, but the fabric really is nice and the print looks great. The price was good too. I liked the beaded tie at the neck and the extra fabric detail the bust.  But there wasn't enough to the elastic tubing.  It was way too narrow.  I like the look and the style, but it did not fit right in the chest. The length was good. I am 5'4"" tall and it hit at my ankle- which I liked.  I usually wear a dress size 12-14 or large being a 36D.  Maybe a 36A would fit this dress better.  Too bad because I liked the look.  Returned it."
3.0,Really pretty but too small
3.0,"I ordered this bag from Fawn Design direct, after following them on social media and seeing a few people with them. I finally ordered one when a color came out with a grab handle and a back pocket for the backpack straps, which seemed to be most people's complaints with the original. I thought I was buying from a family run US company, which is technically true. However, when the bag arrived, it has a large tag inside that says MADE IN CHINA. So, the company is located in the US, but the product is manufactured in China. I felt misled.<br /><br />Since the bag is synthetic material, it had a horrible smell. I literally had to leave it out of the box for a good WEEK for it to not smell or leave the things inside smelling horrible. It's a cute design, but overall, I feel like it's overpriced for what you get. It doesn't actually hold as much as my other diaper backpack (xy base by jujube, or Columbia Carson Pass). Once you pack the pockets, it's a little tough to get things in and out. The straps seem okay, but they always slide a bit when I put it on, and I have to adjust them every time, which is a bit annoying. They also hit right at my armpit. I haven't worn it much, honestly. It's also heavy on it's own, since it's lined inside and out with the same faux leather material.<br /><br />I was going back and forth on this one and the Freshly Picked. The backpack straps on the FP were a lot thinner, and didn't seem to be that comfortable, but it was lighter, and didn't smell. You can't return these if you take the wrapper off the hardware, which means you can't attached any of the straps to even try it on. I'm sure I'll use it, but I'm not in love with it like a lot of people are."
3.0,"It was missing a jewel, but luckily it isn't terribly noticable. Also the mask is metal and was bent on one side upon arrival. I tried to straighten it, but you know how you can never fully unbend metal...always a crease left.<br /><br />Attractive mask though. :)"
3.0,To small in calves for thicker thighs
3.0,"The darts will work will for my sons 8 yr birthday party.  I am a bit disappointed that the wrist band did not come with the package as indicated.  The darts are of an OK quality and well worth the cost savings; however, I likely won't buy them again as they did not include all of the items specified and the dart tips are pretty hard."
3.0,Necklace broke after<br />One day of wear
3.0,The back doesnt match the lines
3.0,"The crystals are beautiful. But be careful, the Black Agate was actually Blue Goldstone.<br />I really needed the black as advertised but not what I received."
3.0,Liked length of dress.Also very soft material.
3.0,Runs smaller than most of their tops.
3.0,"Bought this for girlfriend, clasp broke on arrival.  Was able to repair it."
3.0,"They're cute for my kid, but they're not weighted properly so they're difficult to manipulate and wouldn't be a good way for him to practice using devil sticks"
3.0,Light barely works.
3.0,Not stainless steel too soft metal
3.0,Did not like the fit - returned it.
3.0,"I ordered 3 dresses for my 5year old (she normally wears a size 5) i ordered Minnie mouse, Moana & Elena of Avalor. All in size 5 (by their chart) They're really cute and the quality is pretty good. But you need to order UP a size or even 2 sizes<br /> ( I should have ordered up 2 sizes)<br />I hope this helps anyone thinking of ordering."
3.0,"very cute, but cheaply made. metal part that goes into ear snapped off. also comes with plastic earring backs that easily slipped off, almost lost one of the earrings. over priced for being such cheap quality. but EXTREMELY cute."
3.0,Not compression but nice thick material.
3.0,So I bought 2 pairs because I always lose or misplace my gloves. I thought they had touch screen sensitivity but it doesn't work at all. The best you get is it turns the screen on.
3.0,Wash before use has a weird smell
3.0,"Gold toe quality is there. However, these are not over the calf as stated in the description."
3.0,"The fabric was stiff, thicker than I expected, and not breathable. The drop-shoulder sleeves were oddly bulky due to the fabric having no drape. Also, it was VERY long on me. I was hoping for above the knee/tunic length. It was well below my knees (mid-calf), and just super frumpy and weird looking. For reference, I am 5""4"", and usually a 4-6 in US sizing. I just looked like I was wearing a very large potato sack. This might be good for people who are much taller and have trouble finding things that are long enough, or, I guess, if you just want a sort of stiff, huge potato sack dress? It is definitely long enough to wear as a dress! The fabric may have softened with washing, but the entire fit was so off, I wasn't going to try. I returned this. I only gave it 3 stars because it was technically wearable--but so unflattering and uncomfortable, I wouldn't want to. I don't know if I just got a completely different product than other reviewers or what?! :-("
3.0,It's cute but size but if your busy or broad shouldered
3.0,"Very pretty! Came loose as metal clasp/crimp.  Luckily my daughter has a jewelery business and used her needelnose to repair it.  Very pretty, many complements."
3.0,"It’s a great sweatshirt, the pictures on it are crisp and nice, but Its my fault for not realizing this isn’t thick sweatshirt material. It’s more of a stretchy, nylon. My daughter is still going to love it for Christmas."
3.0,I got the dark grey skirt and it is a beautiful color and the length is great. The material is super soft and is very well made. This skirt is very comfortable but not good for wearing in public because the material is too thin and revealing. The material is very thin so it is see through but if you wear something under it you can see every bump and line. This skirt has very visible panty lines no matter what kind you have on so I will not be wearing this skirt out of the house. (I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review) This is no way impacted my review of this product. If you find this review helpful please hit the helpful button.
3.0,"It was too small, had to give it away. So cute thou"
3.0,I have a large wrist and this is too large without some manipulation.
3.0,"I like these pants but they run extremely small and they do not stretch. I usually wear a 0 or 2. I bought a 4 and while the waist was fine, I could barely get my thighs and calves into them. Since they were so cheap, I cut them into shorts - they're still tight in the thigh but with a little vertical cut down the side, they'll be alright; I'll wear them at least a handful of times this summer. I'd suggest buying 2 sizes up."
3.0,Fits wel but the material is like a stretchy Lycra that slides down a lot<br />They aren't see through and are a good texture but<br />they don't stay up well :/
3.0,"I looked at the reviews and they were very mixed. Some said get a size up and some said get a size down, well in my case, a size down (if not two) was what I should have went with. I am 5'3, 125 pounds and the small was too big. I also did not realize the short set was a skort rather than just shorts. However, the fabric and stitching were great. The color was only slightly lighter than what I felt was presented in the picture but not a drastic difference. I had no issues or concerns with the garment itself, just the sizing."
3.0,Bought for vacation in Florida.. Not much  to say it was just a ok outfit .
3.0,"Nice material, bright colors.  Just too much like scrubs."
3.0,I would love it more if it were more waistline friendly for plus size people and if the zipper didn't randomly break (I wasn't wearing it. It broke while in my purse)
3.0,correct size but does not fit
3.0,These are exactly what I expected to get. The quality is poor but I didn’t expect anything fabulous. They were played with for a weekend before they started to break. We used them as party favors.
3.0,The bracelets are alright. Both of the anchors broke and also the strings on both of them have snapped.
3.0,"I needed 25 drawstrings to complete a project, so this pack of 28 seemed perfect. Unfortunately, there were only 24 in the pack when it arrived. I’m disappointed that I didn’t receive the number that I paid for and expected to receive."
3.0,Genuine Turquoise is really hard to find these days. The ones I received crumbled and looked like polymer clay of some sort. Can’t use for upscale jewelry in any way and I’d have to sell as “imitation” which is not what my brand is about. So it was a waste for the business but will use as kitschy jewelry for family and friends-disappointed but not surprised considering how inexpensive they were.
3.0,"I washed one time and the elastic began to come out of seams.  For what I paid, I expected more for my money!"
3.0,"The bracelet is just what I was looking for. But, it has a disgusting smell that I can't get out of it. So, I don't think I will be able to wear it. Very disappointed."
3.0,I felt it fit at least a size smaller than it says
3.0,This Lace Up style runs short and the inside seams are uncomfortable. I was disappointed in this style. I own the Slip On style which are wonderful. Purchase half size larger than you wear.
3.0,"Just got the scarf today. It is cute and soft, but there isnt actually a pocket. The zipper opens up to the entire scarf. While storing items in the scarf will still be fine, retrieving them might become a bit of an issue. I am afraid I will feel a little like Mary Poppins digging around in the never ending pocket looking for my lip gloss..."
3.0,I gave this a 3 because i returned it.  I wanted something for my iPad but I didnt read the demensions I only went by the picture.  The quality was good and had it been a little bigger I would have kept it....but that was my fault
3.0,"Love the boots, but returned them because they were too small, got a bigger size."
3.0,It’s ok good in a pinch if u have nothing else. Color is nice and it stretches thank god but extremely poor quality. It came already pulling and stringy. The tag has no name so I can imagine where it’s made
3.0,Too small. Clingy. Had to return the shirt. Disappointed as it felt soft & I loved the look of it!
3.0,They have indents inside or puncture wholes. My daughters a size 8 1/2 to nine and the nine to ten is close to an eleven. Her feet is six inches long.
3.0,"Nice blazer. But the sizing is of, runs small."
3.0,My daughter says these are comfortable and super cute with the bright colors.<br />Only downfall is that the filter falls out when the mask is stretched. It's easy to fix but afraid she is going to lose the filter if it falls out at school.
3.0,I love the feel of the fabric but the size is a bit large (I bought a small).  I am hoping after couple of washes it will shrink. I like the square design and the 95% cotton 5% spandex blend.  The stitching is also top notch.
3.0,A little too stiff. Hard to walk with these
3.0,"Adds some oomph to my accessories. Especially when I go camouflage, it compliments the look rather nicely."
3.0,It didn’t fit way to small.. This was not a large
3.0,Runs true to size. Material was just clingier than I liked.
3.0,"Poor quality, wore it once and is falling apart."
3.0,"I’ve ordered multiple pairs of light indigo, vintage, and dark indigo. Unfortunately I get Different color tones and lengths every time I order the same pants again. They all wash out to the basic denim color (light blue) within a couple months of washing according to the tag on cold, never machine dried. This time they were very green looking and fit very loose, lacking the tight comfortable denim feel that drew me into buying this product multiple times. This is now my 4th pair because they are exceptionally comfortable for work, but I’m probably not going to buy them again. Quality is definitely lacking and they are different every time I buy them."
3.0,"too loud inside sounds like a windbreaker, not worth it so returned"
3.0,it was a pyjama for my son and he is 8y now and the pyjama size was 9years but the trouser was short length like 3/4 .<br />but the quality of the fabric is really soft .
3.0,Didn't hang like the model
3.0,These pants are pretty comfortable. They are a slick stretchy type of material. Have issues with them falling down/ not staying up due to the slickness of the material. They fit as expected and look as pictured. Overall happy with them!
3.0,"Got my daughter a medium. She's 4'6&#34;, 96 lbs. And it just barely fits. I won't be able to dry it at risk of it shrinking. It's very cute but all the buttons are extremely loose so I don't expect it to hold up long or get my money's worth out of it."
3.0,"It fits but it’s super loose, not a form fitting as you’d think"
3.0,nice looking watch and i liked the kinetic concept but even though i wear it most days it stops
3.0,"I ordered in Khaki, the actual color is a mustard yellow. Be sure to order up a size or two. I had planned on giving this as a gift to someone else, but seeing the size of it and ordering them a XXL, but this being more of a M/L I am keeping it for myself. I am 5'4&#34; and wear a 10/12 and the XXL fits me perfectly."
3.0,"I bought this based on the great reviews for torso length, modest neckline, and quality. I was looking for a swimsuit that had a modest neckline, and this one does *for me*, but once it arrived I realized I bought a nearly identical swimsuit for my daughter last year at Kohl's in the Tek Gear brand and on her, the neckline is not as modest as we would like, so it all depends on your bust size, perkiness, whether your breast volume is on top or bottom, and body type.  Also, this charm Leaks swim top does not provide adequate support for anything above in my guess a B cup.  She and I are both a 34D and usually a Medium to Large (depending on how fitted we want) in tops for reference.  I purchased the Large because reviews said it runs small.  I found it to be a good size except the band under the bust that would support the breasts did not even touch my skin, therefore did nothing to support my breasts.  The stomach area was nicely generous and long enough.  A Medium would have worked better to sit snugly under the bust, but it is still not a very supportive top for even average busts.  I read several reviews on here that this was great for support of large busts and I'm floored anyone thinks that.  I can only assume they have never had a quality swimtop made for large breast support.  Even for my average size this is inadequate.  If you don't need a great deal of support it would suffice like any standard swimsuit top you'd find at Walmart, but if you're specifically looking for great bust support, this is not the top for you.  Otherwise I have no complaints.  We bought a nearly identical top in the Tek Gear brand at Kohl's and the fit is very different.  Perhaps the manufacturer is different, but I will show pictures for reference.  The Tek Gear brand has a thicker and more supportive band under the bust that I would feel more comfortable and supported in; however, the torso part is tighter and shorter.  As you can see in the pictures, the Tek Gear version of this faded quickly.  My daughter only wore it a few times last summer because she, like me, prefers a suit with more coverage and a longer torso length so she wore a different one most of the summer.  The Charm Leaks one definitely fits the bill for a bit longer torso length and room (though I'm not sure it is so much longer that it will work for a long torso.  Daughter and I have average torsos).<br /><br />I am returning this top and still on the hunt for a more supportive and modest top.  When daughter and I shopped at Kohl's this top did win out in the support and modesty factor, so it isn't bad just not as good as I would like in those areas.  Since all people have a different definition of modest, mine is no cleavage showing at all not even a little at the top.  This worked great for covering me but daughter's did show some at the top.<br /><br />I gave this three stars because while it doesn't work for me that doesn't mean it is a terrible suit.  The quality seems nice, the straps ar adjustable, the neckline would be way more modest than pretty much everything else I see at the beach or public pools, it doesn't cause weird underarm fat to appear like most suits, and the pattern and colors are very pretty.<br /><br />I hope this review helps those also shopping online."
3.0,Material is meeeeh. Not high quality.
3.0,beautiful but very cheap fabric. fading and piling almost immediately
3.0,very nice...runs small..
3.0,"The straps are a little more clunky than I thought they'd be.  And it has a quote from the bible sewn on the inside - I'm not really into that stuff.  Luckily it's on the inside, however, so I can ignore it.  Also, I thought it would be more wallet-looking, but really just looks like a camera bag you could buy cheaply at a souvenir stand."
3.0,Excelente regalo pero con el tiempo notamos que se van desprendiendo los números con el lavado.
3.0,I don’t particularly like the stiffness of the decals but I guess that is to be expected.  I wouldn’t but again but are okay for the purchase price and also for the novelty.
3.0,Way too  big in places it should be fitted
3.0,WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T DROP IT
3.0,I put this on my wish list and my husband purchased it for me as a gift. I just got it and was somewhat disappointing. It is nothing like the description and is much cheaper made than I had thought based on the ad. Would not buy it again based on the Bait and switch I feel happened with this item.
3.0,"This romper is cute, soft and my favorite print. It feels nice on and is well made. My cons are that it isn’t the exact print shown and the coloring is a bit muted. It also runs big, I am 5’9” and 125-130lbs. It hits my ankles perfectly and isn’t tight on the legs-which is great since I have bigger legs from years of soccer, but it is baggy. I feel like it definitely adds weights onto me and makes me lose my shape overall. If you’re petite, i feel like you would just drown in it. I wish they made an XS!! I do plan on keeping it.  It is comfy and will be nice for days around the house or when I need something a little looser.<br />Good product overall."
3.0,This band fits my galaxy gear watch perfectly. It is not nearly as comparable as the band that came with the watch although that's a given. This is much cheaper. Its not as comfy on my wrist and I hoped for but it works. The little loop that the band goes into after bucking falls off easily. It definitely works for now.
3.0,"The fabric of the dress is probably the best quality of any dress I've gotten on Amazon. I was so excited when i started unfolding it. But putting it on was a different story. The tiny straps are too dinky, so if you use it as a halter (like i wanted), it's ridiculously digging into your neck like a wire. If it's split so it's over the shoulders, they still dig in & it's unflattering if you have any extra weight. It runs very big, so maybe if you get it very fitted around the bodice, that would help hold some of the weight of it up. ALSO, it runs BIG. I'm a 38D, size 12/14, 5'10"", 180lb woman, and the smocked bodice area was hanging loose on me. ALSO, the cut around the chest is very strange, i don't see how this would lay well around a busty woman. I think it would only lay correctly if you're flat."
3.0,"The material, style, and design are all great. I chose to return this item, though, because the skirt is too short to wear for professional golf outings. If you're comfortable with a shorter fit (there are shorts sewn under the skirt), this is a great skirt."
3.0,The material is very sheer. The care label is completely visible through the back of the tank. Probably a return. It is cute.
3.0,"These definitely aren't what's pictured.  The gray is like a heathered cotton poly blend. The three stars is because they fit great and are extremely comfortable. Also, they were $3 and I received two. That's a great buy.  If you want quality, be realistic."
3.0,not dark enough but it works
3.0,Looks very nice. I have receive compliments from co-workers. The strings for tying are a bit long but I manage to make them shorter by retying them. My only complaint is that the string breaks after a month or so of use. This is my second bracelet.The string material is not good at all. There should be a waterproof string that would last longer.
3.0,They tarnish really fast mine was less than week
3.0,Most of them broke within first time wearing them
3.0,Dress is clingy and not flattering at all.  I sized up just in case.  Not for me.
3.0,The product is nice but I used it today for the first time and one of the snaps that keeps it closed broke.
3.0,ok and somewhat large.
3.0,"I guess I was expecting something a little different when it said &#34;seamless&#34; and they are a little too big but other than that they are a nice material and seem to be a good quality product. I would order the product again, just a smaller size."
3.0,"I ordered the orange pair, hoping it was close to the shade it showed online. When they arrived, they were closer to a coral color. Still somewhat orange, just not the shade I was hoping for/expecting. The glasses themselves seem sturdy and block sun quite well, so I'm pleased in that regard."
3.0,I didn't realize it didn't come with the cheatsheets.
3.0,"Tight for me anyway, maybe not for you. I have not had fit issues with other Smiths and I have had 5 other styles in the past. Also, no box. That's ok, but just wondered if they were legit? They look good and feel solid enough. The little brochure inside mentions the warranty is only good through official Smith dealers. Hmmm."
3.0,Only use 1 size<br /> not bad
3.0,Thought it would be a bit longer and to fit more loose. Wear medium woman shirts and only 5'5''.
3.0,While I didn’t spend a ton of money on these I expected them to look a little more well made. I bought as a Christmas gift for my girls and honestly I could have gotten the same thing at a .99 cent store and paid way less.
3.0,"I got these for my 4 year old daughter only because they had two sets of clip on mermaid earrings. When they arrived, the set is different than what is pictured though my daughter did like the French bulldogs. They do clip on nicely and seem decently made but disappointed that what we received was not what was pictured/expected."
3.0,This was a cute mask. Though you can't read the words very clearly due to the natural construction of the mask (Only less words could have changed this). I cut a hole in the back to place a filter in it and it was fine.
3.0,"I ordered the silent black leather belt for my husband. Great quality belt at a reasonable price. Superior quality to anything I’ve found up to $50 in a retail store. Belt came rolled up in a tin-like round container with lid. Exactly as described. Haven’t had it for long yet, so I cannot comment on the life span of the leather. Hopefully it will last for years<br /><br />*****EDIT 5/7/19*****  Belt buckle snapped and the plastic (or cheap metal?) actually broke. I can't even repair it. See photo. I am contacting the seller. Note the seller contacted me within 24 hours of the sale, seeking positive feedback. Also offered to send a second belt for free if I were to leave a positive review. I did, and the second ""free"" belt was received.<br />Seeing the quality (or lack thereof) of materials in the belt buckle has caused me to reduce the feedback. The belt buckle should definitely be solid, strong steel for this price. It's hard to say that I'm disappointed, but I truly am."
3.0,"I bought this to wear to a rehearsal dinner for a wedding in Mexico. The coloring was perfect for the event! I had hoped it would be a little longer, I prefer my hems to be closer to the knees - but it was so comfortable. The elastic around the waist actually hit a little high on my torso, but I don't think anyone noticed. Worth the money! I got tons of compliments."
3.0,They tend to ride down as I am working out  I like them but they need a longer cut crotch to waist
3.0,cute but didnt fit that great.
3.0,"The materials look good but this hat has a VERY long bill, much longer than your typical baseball cap. This could be good for those who want extra sun protection, but it looks comically long. My hat size is 7 3/4 and this fit appropriately."
3.0,Cute shirt but the quality of the fabric seems cheap.
3.0,This dress is beautiful. I cannot believe the price. The fabric is almost a soft matte type silk. The draping of the top is really flattering. I was worried because I have a bigger bust but it drapes nicely. The only thing is it’s too small. I’d say I’m a true XL bordering a large - I’m very curvy (hourglass shape). I ordered this in an XL and I cannot get it over my hips and I can’t get the zipper in the back to zip all the way. I’m so sad
3.0,"Too big on petite 3 year old girl face- they do fit her (big head) twin brother, but of course he doesn't care for the color!"
3.0,My niece loved this but to me it seemed old or used. Still had tags on it though.. Wouldn't have bought it if I saw it in person.
3.0,"Bought for my son who loves it, but the sleeves a little short and its a little small"
3.0,"Fits ok... I went up a size, but it fits more like a large weird neck opening than an off the shoulder shirt ( you end up sliding the whole shirt over to get it off shoulder. Material not what I expected... very shiny. Seems well made"
3.0,Beautiful skirt but runs big
3.0,"This rubs a little big, I also think the material is thinner than all her other swimsuits. The print is fine and I really like the style of the swimsuit. I don't think it'll make it for an entire summer, it reminds me of those cheap suits that discolor."
3.0,"I actually like them..  the only problem is, the lens came with two scratches. I guess that happened because they didn't come in a hard case."
3.0,"This is a straight forward style cargo pant!.... Waist is fairly close to normal comparatively to US sizing......Better than most on cargo pants market. .........But not as good as ""MATCH STICK"" cargo pants. (Available on Amazon) Match stick (Order one size up) has better quality material and design!!...........But, none the less, not a bad cargo pant overall......length can be questionable if over you are over 6ft or have really long legs........"
3.0,"Scarf was very soft but looks kinda flat. It doesn't really look full like the one in the picture, no matter how I arrange it. Just kinda skinny. It could be in the picture there are two on the mannequin."
3.0,Runs very short in front (and I'm petite) but is nice and lightweight.
3.0,Not my expectations on the product
3.0,Bigger than I expected but pretty.
3.0,Difficult to use.
3.0,The shorts fit perfectly but the shirt is way too small! The shirt can’t be a 3x
3.0,Bag is pretty I use with a tablet for work.  Handle broke after  3months
3.0,"I was so excited for this ring, but I had to return it because the underside was so sharp from fabrication, it was literally rubbing my skin off. I tried to buff it smooth with a dremel, but had no luck. Disappointing. Was very pretty."
3.0,"My daughters volleyball team ordered these for spirit week at school. Unfortunately, they were cropped more than they expected. We returned ours but other girls wore a tank top under it so it didn't break school dress code."
3.0,"Although my wife and I are not Ukrainian I purchased this item to show our support for the Ukrainian people and proudly wore them and told all or friends about them.<br />The item looks very. nice and the bracelet material seems not only durable, but looks very nice, 5 stars.  However, the clasp is TERRIBLE it opens up very easily and the bracelet easily falls off 0 stars.<br />We received the bracelet two days ago at which time I gave one to my wife.  Yesterday, when she went to take off her jewelry she noticed that her bracelet was missing.  She says it must have fallen off and she didn't notice it.  Today, the same thing happened to me.  Now, three days after receiving the bracelets both are lost hence the 3 star review.<br />If the manufacturer would just change the clasp to one the does not open as easily the bracelets would get a five star review and the sales would probably sky rocket.<br />In the meantime, we will still support the Ukrainian people in their fight for liberty and freedom, we just won't be wearing a bracelet that shows our support. ""SLAVA UKRANI!"""
3.0,"The silicon on the bottom is insufficient to prevent slipping. Fabric is very thin, so not very effective keeping feet warm (which was the main reason I bought them, else one can very well practise yoga barefoot). They fit reasonably well, but nothing special."
3.0,Hot and thick! If you want a great wintertime face mask this is it. Just not a summer mask.
3.0,I like the multiple ways to tote it but it's somewhat cheaply made.
3.0,"It's not the best quality, but it's reasonable for my uses. I do environmental education as well as animal-themed birthday parties, so I often find myself dressed as a rain forest explorer. I also just got a tattoo on my wrist, so I bought these to cover that up when need be. I have really small wrists, so they don't fit perfectly, but I really appreciate the three settings. I wouldn't say that these would survive constant wear, but they work well for a costume or the like."
3.0,"Top was tight. I’m typically a small and that’s what I ordered. The inner material of top and gloves were scratchy and irritating so I ended up buying soft stretchy fabric to line the inside. Overall satisfied with the purchase, best quick and affordable Valkyrie outfit you can get."
3.0,My husband used  the shirts under a flannel button down shirt.  I don’t like that they wrinkle so easy and are so stiff.
3.0,Didn’t fit well. Cheaply made
3.0,"The shoes themselves are great. They clearly are good, quality made shoes that will last. However, I am unhappy with the packaging. I bought these as a gift for someone and the &#34;milk carton&#34; was very beat up as well as already opened, as if they had been returned. Will think twice before ordering as a gift again."
3.0,It wasn't like the picture at all. I regifted it to my 10yr old neice even though I ordered an XL. Sizes are way off.
3.0,"Excellent service in delivery but watch is what you pay for.  It's cheap, made in China, quit working the 3rd day.  If you want a cheap watch that works, try somewhere else."
3.0,"This top is cute and the fabric is cool but it is bright ass bubblegum pink, not the Heathered pinky purple in the stock photos,"
3.0,This is for skinny girls with tiny arms. but not for average sizes
3.0,I don’t want to bash the item. However it did not meet the need and it looks much better online than in person. I returned it. Also it seemed to run short and I’m only 4’11”.<br />It may work for you; the price surely is right.
3.0,"May be &#34;oversized&#34; for xs, s, or m.  If you're large or x-large, buyer beware."
3.0,Overall the bag is nice. A couple quality issues were the front clasp on the bag was a little crooked. And the zipper on the pouch that comes with it zips about halfway then gets stuck.
3.0,"These run smaller than expected, and the fabric seems a bit cheap and thin."
3.0,"I was expecting these to be a bit more of a thin, athletic type material. They are a bit heavy and not as flattering as I was hoping for. The pockets on the hips stick out a little, which I hate, but they are short enough for a petite woman such as myself. I would not buy them again, but I am keeping them as weekend/errand pants."
3.0,"So disappointed as the dress was so pretty, but unfortunately was way too short to be worn as a dress. i bought an XL as I am busty on top & it fit there just was not long enough. I would definitely say this dress runs on the smaller side as I usually buy XL dresses and have a little extra room.<br /><br /> I could have put on some cute jeans or leggings & used this as a top but I bought it as a dress. Returned to Amazon same day."
3.0,Good packaging quality but color much more brighter than in picture and texture of material is hard/too rigid for usual belt.
3.0,No quedo como  esperada
3.0,"I purchased the black color. Very pretty. Not easy to size. I tried, my husband tried, and a jeweler wouldnt touch in fear of scratching. I ended up sending it back. I hope others have better luck, it is very pretty."
3.0,They are for smaller faces
3.0,"I bought it because reviews said it ran small, but it was huge on me (like 2 inches too wide and slides around on my hair). I like the distressed look and the shape, but I'm either going to return or have to foam pad the insides or something."
3.0,"These are great! They are really funny looking with all of the glitter and puff-balls. They are festive and fun. However, they are made of simple-enough materials that you could reproduce them yourself in minutes. The head is like foam/paper, the nose a white puff ball, glued on plastic eyeballs, etc. Regardless, I don't have the time to make them from scratch, so  this is a good deal."
3.0,"Fit is true to size.<br />The whole bone decal was discolored (yellow) in random areas throughout as if it was heated to long.<br />For the price, I can’t complain much though! I purchased it for a once-a-year wear so overall, it served its purpose!"
3.0,"Strong solid construction and I think I’d be happy w them. But my small face frame made these unfortunately, not viable."
3.0,"BUST IS VERY TIGHT AND THE DRESS IS NOT AS FLARED AS PIC SHOWS,  LIKE THE MATERIAL.  WILL GIVE IT TO MY SIS"
3.0,The bottoms were not as I expected and the cut of the top is a little wacky.
3.0,"Super cute but the bust area is too small, everything else fit ok. I wear a 40F-G bra and the suit had the girls popping out if I wore it where it was supposed to be. I'm 5'7"" and approx 240lbs. The top went to the tops of my thighs, but the bottoms felt a little small too. Returning."
3.0,It is very see through!  Not for every day but I'm guessing hubby wont mind!
3.0,"Runs extremely small. Son is 12 month old. Ordered size 18-24 months hoping to replace another discontinued leather shoe and it was almost the same size as his 12 month old shoes. Although I had trouble getting them on his feet. I came back to purchase a larger size and sadly, they don't have one. The design and quality is exceptional though."
3.0,So-so shirt
3.0,Was  not  very comfortable was not happy
3.0,Runs small size upppp
3.0,Loved the earings but they broke after 1 month.good product for the price.
3.0,"As a watch it's fine, and it does have a unique appearance.  As an E6B it's pointless as the numbers and graduations are too small to effectively use, and a dive-watch style time external bezel would be much more useful than an &#34;hour hand sun rule&#34; compass bezel.  The minute hand is massive and I have mixed feelings on it; it's actually quite helpful in a cockpit environment because more than any other watch I have worn I can glance out of the corner of my eye and have a high confidence of what 5 minute block of minutes I'm in, but it also means that there is about a 20 minute period every hour when the minute hand blocks enough of the digital display for it to not be at all useful."
3.0,I did like this top color/pattern/floral but something about it just didn't fit right. It isn't as long in real life as the picture makes it look in my opinion. The headhole is also very small.
3.0,"It was all I expected it to be, however it only lasted a couple of week before it fell apart.  The pin pulled out form the bod.  Very disappointing."
3.0,"I am always a medium in my tops and bottoms. I ordered a large, thinking it might be a better fit since I have added a few ""Covid pounds"". But even the large was too small! A large should have been plenty big, so you might want to keep this in mind.,"
3.0,"I gave it only 3 stars because the sizing is way off.  I really liked the item, but it is at least 2 sizes if not more off than it should have been.  Nice colors and material though.  If it was larger I would love wearing it."
3.0,the middle necklace was not centered at all with the other two but its a ok necklace
3.0,"Seems to run short, not a crop top but definitely not as long as I’d like"
3.0,Super cute but the color faded very quickly.
3.0,Not terrific but more than reasonable for the price.  They appear to be some nylon or polester like blend; certainly not cashmere.  Needed them to wear under a wrist brace to help with irritation and they accomplish that well.
3.0,I like the necklace however some of the pearls fell off the first time I wore it.
3.0,like it but is a little small and makes it hard to breath because its tight against my mouth.
3.0,I love the shirt but much smaller than expected before washing. Usually XL leaves me quite a but of room but is uncomfortably tight. Order bigger than usually wear.
3.0,Good quality but runs a little bit big
3.0,"There are many good things going for this suit.  Price is very reasonable.  Pretty good quality.  The bottoms are fully lined, front and back.<br />The top is the weak point.  I had hoped that the bottom band would be wide, which is how it looks to me in the photos listing the item (I didn't see any customer photos for the real-life take).  The bottom band is not wide, and when I tie it at the back it scrunches down to nothing.  That's in part because I am not small-chested.  I'm not busty, either.  This top still gives me side-boob, and the cups don't offer much coverage there.  Now, if you're twenty and accustomed to wearing three triangles of fabric and calling it a bathing suit, this suit is going to feel like it has a great deal of coverage.  For those of us with more life experience (and pregnancies, and kids pulling at us on the beach), this feels like a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen.<br />Love the bottoms, will keep the suit to pair those with another top.  At around $15 each, it's still worth it to me to buy two different suits to get pieces that I can wear and feel good but not risky!"
3.0,Its great for the price but it just fits a tad off.
3.0,Not as gorgeous as it looks in the picture
3.0,"Be careful, or you will rip these thin gloves when you are putting them on; totally not reusable."
3.0,Overall its fine but disappointed to see a white mark on the top corner. (See photo)
3.0,"I am not excited about the dress. It is more of a straight cut than A line as described. I was expected fun, flirty and flouncy.<br /><br />The fabric is a light chenille that reads a bit like industrial carpeting.<br /><br />It was true to size for me, but other reviewers complained that it runs small."
3.0,It is not the usual S size.
3.0,"Everyone in my family told me to never wear them again.  Big and black with little gold rhinestones all over the arms and rim.  None of that would normally deter me from keeping them but the nose pads are literally a quarter inch apart, and these seem to be designed for someone with a nose like a tortilla chip.  The are heavy and solid - made of glass and metal."
3.0,Satin Finish
3.0,"Very cute. Took months to get the correct package. Still very cute though. The first package came with two of the 'I'll be waiting' ones. I was promised a two week correction for no charge, wound up waiting a whole 23 days. Still cute though, boyfriend works offshore and he loves them."
3.0,"Thing is huge! ""Bulky"" across the board... From the watch face to the casing, even the watch ban is like trying to use a huge slab of thick cut bacon to wrap it around your wrist.  Considering large face watches are now out of style you run the highly visible risk of being pegged a child of 2016/17... It works though! Survived a week in the life of me so.... That's a positive for any article of mens jewelry."
3.0,They are cute and comfortable but rated low as they run narrow and I had to return.
3.0,Loved this shirt except after washing it on permanent press in cold water the sleeves end up with holes.
3.0,"slides off a lot, and the material rubs off very soon after wearing it.<br />not quite sure how I should go about washing this either."
3.0,This dress definitely fit really strange! Fit around butt and thighs tight but extremely loose at the top and waste. Almost stretched out? All my other bandage dresses fit great so I'm not sure what's going on with this one? The apricot pink was just as pictured though and really cute if it only fit the way it's supposed to
3.0,It was beautiful but broken.
3.0,Didn’t like the material it clung very tightly showing everything.
3.0,"First pair got a hole in it pretty quickly. Second pair is lasting, but not for use under hot water. I use them for cleaning"
3.0,The coat is really pretty. The only problem was the zipper was loose on it and I had to re-sew it back on at the bottom. Other than that it is really warm and comfortable.
3.0,It looks like a scarf with cutouts for the arms. Not what I expexted.
3.0,Pendant is beautiful but chain has much to be desired.  Tarnished to the point I could not get it clean with a polishing cloth.  Had to buy a new chain because it looked bad with the pendant.
3.0,These gloves remind me of cheap Dollar Store gloves. This was not what I had expected. My hands were still cold in a short time while outdoors. However they do have grip on the inside and I can scroll my phone without removing them.
3.0,"short,nothing like the picture"
3.0,This is a very comfortable pullover. I absolutely love the feel of the material and the little lace makes it great for nicer casual wear.<br />The pockets though…they just hang. Making the feel of them slightly uncomfortable and the shirt heavier than normal.
3.0,"I love the length, print and style of this shirt. However, it runs really big and the fabric is cheap feeling.  I like my clothes large, and at 5'3"", 115lbs, a medium, the smallest size available, should work but it's HUGE. The color is not the orangy red in the picture; it is a claret red and is much prettier."
3.0,It’s really nice but just way bigger than I expected!
3.0,Great for around the go
3.0,They sent me a size to big and the material is very thin and loose I kept having to pull them up... Stitching is also loose one of the pockets fell off after the first wash
3.0,I like the style but wearing it felt like I was wearing a giant blanket. Also the material isn’t very comfortable. I don’t know if I’ll wear it again. Disappointing.
3.0,"For the price of 21.99/3 the bras are a good deal. However, the overall quality is decent. I normally wear a 36C and ordered Large and they fit fine. They're more of a casual fit versus a tight fit. So if you have a &quot;robust&quot; chest I would not recommend these. Side Note: The blk/wht bras fit differently than the grey one in the pack. The grey ran smaller in my opinion."
3.0,Pretty but pointy. It sticks you in the belly with the points.
3.0,I'm 5'7 and the legs were to short:(
3.0,I say useful because it is a mask to wear & has loop to hang over your neck while not using it. I just don’t happen to like the feel of material on my nose & mouth.
3.0,"Cute zip up for fall, nice and warm, but only came to the top of my hips.  For reference, I'm only 5'1"" so it would be almost cropped for taller people.  Good option if that's the fit you're looking for."
3.0,Snap buttons definitely cheapen the look of this cardigan. Yellow color is closer to camel brown in person. Still debating whether or not I’ll return this item. It does fit true to size.
3.0,The umbrella is nice but the hinges rust.
3.0,Changed colors after few months and that's without being worn!
3.0,"Pretty dress, but ran a little big. Other reviews say that the top part (shoulders) is big, and it is. The arms were a little tight, but the waist and down fit great. Long story short - this dress fits inconsistently in different places, so overall the fit was a little awkward for me. Pretty design though."
3.0,"The purse was well constructed and liked the design.  I'm a huge fan of LeSportsac and will definitely buy from this line again.  The only real issue I have with it is it is too small to hold everything.  While it is a ""handbag"" calling it a ""tote"" is a bit of a stretch.  It's basically a very small purse.  I have to send it back because the picture is deceiving and it looks larger.  I don't recall if there were measurements posted but if not - it would be my recommendation the seller post measurements of the purse so people purchasing can really understand what size it is."
3.0,Really great style but very cheap quality.
3.0,"Fits small, but the quality is good."
3.0,"Very cute shoes, sent them back because they were to small and I have small feet."
3.0,Like the way they feel
3.0,"Beware! These pants are not the same as the picture! The picture shows an all over print, but the pants we received are mostly solid color with the print on the inside of thigh and seat (everywhere that touches the saddle)."
3.0,"Pros: The color is a lovely red, the length is good, and the material seems to be good quality.<br /><br />Cons: They're not as heart shaped as it looks here, and they project fairly far forward. They show through clothing very clearly through unlined bras."
3.0,"I like this product but I thought the items would be regular size, this is a great for travel and trips where space is limited."
3.0,its's just OK
3.0,Pretty but fragile
3.0,"I am not a very big person, but for a mans watch, the band is a little short."
3.0,Cute bag it inside zipper fell of first time I used it!😢
3.0,A little itchy on the arm
3.0,I thought the dress would fall like picture but it didn't. It's a form fitting dress but it's long enough I'm 5'7 and it's my preferred length.
3.0,This bracelet seems cheap. I probably wouldn't have purchased it in person. But not worth the effort to return.
3.0,"It works, it looks good, but took too long to deliver."
3.0,the material is somewhat shiny
3.0,"Loved the ease of this dress, the small cutouts are perfect, shrunk a lot though!! Can't wear it for anything but a beach cover up now:/"
3.0,"This is more of a boot liner than sock. The foot area is misshapen wherein it’s as if someone described a sock to a blind alien, and then the alien sowed a sock. Good slouch though."
3.0,Expected cotton.  Looks cheaP
3.0,"I purchased a teal and a pink swim cap for a myself and a friend. I purchased them because she dyes her hair all sorts of pretty colors, and the pool's chlorine fades the color. I bought one for myself in solidarity, and so that If I decide to dye my hair it will be protected, too. We needed something cute AND practical. 3 stars for cute!<br /><br />Unfortunately, caps are too big for both of our heads. They keep our shortish hair out of the water, but water comes up and into the cap around the ears and nape of the neck when we play underwater tea party. My head is 22 inches around the brow and 23 inches in circumference.<br /><br />My long suffering husband tried it on so that I could see if it fit him. It did. He has a gigantic head. His measurement is 26 inches around the brow.<br /><br />So, it's a fine cap if you are transgendered lady, are a drag queen, or just love pretty things and have a large head. OR if you have a normal/small sized head and don't like going underwater. Neither of those things apply to my friend and me."
3.0,Not long - I am 5&#34;10 and it was above my ankle bones.
3.0,"Item is not as pictured in the listing. The band is not as wide as most of my other bands where it attaches to your watch face. The glittered portions of the band have none, just a photo copy of what glitter looks like. To me it looks like a knockoff version of what was pictured."
3.0,"These are very cute but not very practical. They fit prefect until i started walking, then they slid all over the place. They are cute if you don't plan on having to walk at all."
3.0,"I wanted to purchase a pair of Frye booties in taupe but my size was not available.  I found these that are very similar in color and style….and so much cheaper since they aren’t real leather.  For the money, they are a good value.  They look more expensive than the price.  But they are very uncomfortable after wearing for a few hours. I would return them but I wore them outside.  If I did it over, I would buy a 1/2 size larger and add insoles, maybe that would help or maybe there is no helping cheap synthetic leather booties from China."
3.0,Bought for my 5 year old granddaughter. When we put it on her and tried to turn it to sit in place it broke. Very pretty but most handle with care
3.0,Not made for someone without mhch of a chest but I love the fabric so much and it hangs well. Length and style look great as you move but the chest was a no.
3.0,"The ordre was too small, but it was replaced with the right size."
3.0,Too lose all around. I kept one but sent the others back. I miss the all cotton version.
3.0,They are cute frames if you have a small slendor face . They will fit you just fine.
3.0,They fit me very well!!!!
3.0,I ordered this for myself and it was loose fitting. If I order again at some point I will order a smaller size
3.0,Great hat for the price.  Too bad it did not fit.
3.0,"I love the concept of these, and they do help with the blue light issues, but when on my glasses, I can see the black hooks that hold it in place.  It is very distracting and makes me feel like I am going to go cross-eyed.  Not the best product."
3.0,Bought if for a workout shirt for hot days.  Not true to size.  If you want it big go a size up.  Bought a large as all the other work out shirts are medium or large.  This fit snug in middle rather than loose.
3.0,I ordered a large because I am currently 7.5 months pregnant and it fit pretty well also it is LONG! Which is amazing I'm 5'8&#34; and maxi dresses never touch the floor on me! however it is very see through so I will be returning it. Cute for the price just make sure you wear skin tone undergarments to avoid them being seen.
3.0,Not what I expected. The neck line comes up higher as do the arm holes. I was looking for more of a tank dress to wear a cute bralette under.  That aside it is a nice color and the quality seems good so far.
3.0,Super cute but size runs small.
3.0,"I am a bit disappointed with this watch. I was pretty excited to get it, but knew within a few minutes of opening it that I would return it.<br /><br />I first want to say that the watch is Skmei brand, which is clearly visible in the pictures. I don't know why the listed brand name on amazon is Voeons. I looked up Skmei online - reviews say they make fairly high quality products, sell &#62;1millon watches a year, and have about 100 employees in china. They sell this very model through alibaba. This model is the Skmei 9106 and can be found on ebay for as little as $12.<br /><br />The watch arrives in a thin plastic sleeve that seems typical of other Skmei watches I saw in youtube videos. The band is leather on the bottom and fake carbon weave on the top with nice red stitching. The clasp works nicely. I thought the band would feel stiff and uncomfortable and that I would immediately switch it for a nato band, but it is surprisingly comfortable. If you do get a nato band I measured the lug width - it is 22.15mm. The spring bars are the easy to remove double flange type.<br /><br />The watch itself looks great at a glance. It is shiny, chrome, busy enough to be interesting, but not overwhelming. I really like how they made the date window that allows you to see a bit more of the date wheel. The background of the watch is black plastic that has a honey comb pattern on it. The white marks for the hours, the 6, the 12, the minute and hour hands all glow in the dark. I didn't realize when I ordered it that there is a tachymeter around the edge in small letters (has anyone ever actually used one?). The three dials are 1/20ths of a second (top), seconds (bottom) and minutes (left). The top wheel is marked 00 at the top and bottom and one complete revolution is 2 seconds. The bottom wheel is seconds from 0-60.  The left wheel is minutes, but is my biggest gripe with the watch and the reason I will return it. The buttons for the chronograph are metal, top is stop/run, bottom is lap/reset. When you reset the watch the second hand and the minute hand unwind back to zero. This can take a little while depending on how much time has elapsed. The button presses are smooth with no click/snap that gives tactile feedback. The movement is nice.<br /><br />I bought this watch because I wanted a working chronograph, mostly for times from 5 to 15 minutes. If you look carefully at the pictures there are no minutes marked from 4 minutes to 25 minutes on the chronograph, which is the area I planned to use most!. Even in the 4 minutes at the start the hand inexplicably starts already at the one minute mark. The hand is too short to see clearly which minute it is pointing at.<br /><br />Overall some people would love this watch. It looks nice, does't feel too cheap, and for very little money does have a working chronograph. From reading other reviews of watches it seems that most people don't use the chronograph anyway. I bought it from amazon so that I had the option to return it and it would't have 6 week shipping from china."
3.0,"For the price, these bras are okay.  Washed them a few times and there is a slight oil odor.  It is not as strong but you can still smell it.  For the price, very comfy."
3.0,"This item fits like it was made for a woman.  There is zero room for your manhood, so it just gets smashed in. Would not reccomend."
3.0,It’s cute but not soft and stretchy. I ordered for my 5 month old who was wearing 3-6 month clothes and it was too big.
3.0,"I thought I would try it in the color black because some of the customers thought it might work in a different color than what they ordered.  NOT.  Every time you thought you wanted to wear it, one look in the mirror would change your mind and you would pick out a different jacket."
3.0,They fit a bit tight and I don't have a big head  lol
3.0,everything is good but its scratchy cause the sequins poke through the seams
3.0,"The color of this dress is darker than the product picture (which is more on the off-white side, rather then the beige that it is)."
3.0,"Looser fit than the sizing chart suggests. I had to return them for smalls. They're still not quite the fit I was looking for. They're also fairly thin. With all that said, they're decent enough shorts for $15."
3.0,This is great quality but it’s to tight and highlights tummy
3.0,"If you are a size 10-12 maybe 14... you will fit the large.I am an XL and size 16 and I ordered this based on reviews that it runs big, they must have revised the sizes because that is no longer the case.For sizes 16 and up don't go there, everything will show and bulge. The material is crazy thin and very see through. Its sad because it has the potential to be a nice dress. I ordered the pink color which is a nice baby pink color and I couldn't wear my waist trimmer underneath because it showed through the material."
3.0,I recommend you try other options. I tried it on and it fits a little odd like loose on the top part. The color design its ironed on and looks cheap. It would have been better to make it without it.<br /><br />The soles of the foot do look decent enough to give you a grip and protect your soles though. So thats why if you don't have other options this will do but I don't recommend it if you can get a more quality item.
3.0,"It's beautiful, fits in bust and waist and the fabric is nice, but it's wayyyy too short. And I'm 5'5"
3.0,"These are very cute. They fit my one year-old and stretched enough for my three-year-old.  And while there are grips on the bottom, they are on the flat part of the foot. Not on the heel or toes, where they would do the most good. If your child has high arches they won't touch the sticky part to the floor at all.  They seem to do a good enough job for my one year old anyway."
3.0,Nice fit. Love the style. Fabric doesn’t breathe well but is nice quality.
3.0,It is a pretty top however the material is not my favorite. One thing I didnt notice from the photo is that there is a gathering in the sleeves around the elbow.  It is also tight in the chest. I will say the pattern is pretty.
3.0,"Liked the look, but rivet-type holes started coming out after the second wear.<br />Canvas was kind of flimsy.<br />but for the price it was hard to be too disappointed."
3.0,"Love this watch, I ordered this for my husband for our 5th wedding anniversary (wood), but there is a small issue. It was too big, so we took it to a local jeweler to have a couple links taken out, and one of the bars keeps falling out of the link and it keeps falling apart. If we can get that fixed it would be great."
3.0,"Normally, a small would fit me, but the medium is tight. Good quality, but size is the problem"
3.0,"Very short waisted, but still a pretty silhouette."
3.0,"This swim suit is more for curvier women. The top part fit okay. The crosses seemed like they weren't positioned correctly to cover nipples, but it's okay for home use. The bottoms... The thicker part that covered my private areas fit just fine, but they strapped pieces that are meant to hug the waist didn't fit at all. They were too large.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, 100 lbs."
3.0,This top is beautiful but very see through and big.
3.0,They’re really thin
3.0,"Item is nice and comfortable,  soft, great colors.  Just a little thin and short. It's a little uncomfortable thru the arms."
3.0,I expected this to be smaller than it is. It's a gift so I'm not sure if it glows or not yet.
3.0,Decent for the price. Top fits larger than expected but nice material
3.0,I just didn't like the bathrobe type material. It was too silky and would be better worn as a poolside dress.
3.0,"These have got to be one of the most god awful, ugly things I have ever seen. My husband loves them though so that is what matters. Purchased them as a gift for his birthday last December.Once again,  ugly.. but my husband loves them. No complaints other than that. TO be fair footy pajamas period just look weird on adults but once again my husband loves them."
3.0,Pretty dress but was a bit large. I would purchase a size smaller
3.0,"These run small, they don’t fit"
3.0,The necklace is great but definitely does not look like gold.
3.0,"it's a nice earring but the 'gold tone' one wasn't, it was more 'bronzish tone' and it does not look nice and shiny it's also a little big about little less than an inch in length and half an inch in height."
3.0,It's cute works good for cards but when I put my iPhone 6 Plus it's a bit snug. I'm glad I don't have a heavy duty case for my phone. I know it will do what I want but if I travel with to much change or cash & store my phone too I have a feeling It won't be able to zip.
3.0,The size was smaller than expected the material was very hot the design was awesome
3.0,Bought this for a 4th of July boat party and ended up not being able to wear it. The top has zero support and could barely stay on. The bottoms were cute and comfy though.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7ac8d0413213b2cf11c83a8d9bd3f358]] This is super cute and great for the price. I will say the quality is not great. The top button hole was closed up (see picture). Also, the tail is literally hanging on by 2 little strings. I will need to reinforce it before it falls off. Overall, it’s super comfy and cute."
3.0,Fit is workable but not great for me.
3.0,"So-so cashmere, runs a little small, but is okay for daily wear."
3.0,Good color but bad quality
3.0,Very cute but super heavy :(
3.0,one size does not fit all...but was compfy
3.0,"The bag was beautiful and well-made, but it was too small for my needs."
3.0,"Over all great just better quality, the vision is there but the quality is where it’s lacking"
3.0,"A little larger than I thought, but cute! I'll still keep them!"
3.0,These are nice but it would of bin great to have like 2-3 different styles since is 50 otherwise good
3.0,"I got two. One was great, the soles on the other pair fell off within weeks."
3.0,to big in arms
3.0,"This dress is adorable. Nice feel to the fabric and very comfortable.<br />The only downfall is, it runs extremely large. I am normally an XS.<br />I am 5’2 103 pounds, and this small is more like a large on me.<br />Sadly I have to return it. Wish I didn’t. If you can get your<br />Correct size, I recommend ordering it. If you are tiny like me... I wouldn’t<br />reccomend it, even an XS would be too big if a small is more like a large."
3.0,"I've only worn it a couple times, but it looks like it gets worn in pretty easily which sucks - but it's a really good/cheap alternative to look cute!"
3.0,"I bought this December 2016.  It looks nice, but the leather is thin and not sturdy.  It has begun to tear,  Recently, the metal part that connects to the watch face will not remain connected.  It keeps coming loose, so I am going to have to purchase another band.  I really liked the color of this band with the silver bezel.  But, unfortunately the band is not holding up.  I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Is ok, i am not very happy with the color,but it does the job!"
3.0,"Bought for my daughter's b-day.  When came in was suprized at the size, and was not as good looking as on site.  She liked it though."
3.0,"Looks great, a little flimsy, but will use as beach cover-up!"
3.0,"I will start off with pros:<br />-Excellent design<br />-Comes in a beautiful, high quality protective case<br />-Comes with several interchangeable lenses<br />-The lenses are polarized<br />-Components that touch the face are rubber coated<br />Cons:<br />-The frame overall is made of cheap materials<br />-The frame is very fragile<br />-The myopia frame is tiny<br />-The myopia frame is cheaply made<br />It is a shame that the materials used to construct the frame are so subpar, especially because the sunglasses (overall) are so versatile and ingenious."
3.0,"While this shirt fits well; it's a bit on the large side, but that's how I expected and preferred it to fit. I ordered one in white and one in blue. The blue color is vibrant, and the shirts are comfortable to wear. I'm able to wear it casually with jeans or shorts, as well as dress it up with a skirt or slacks and a chunky statement necklace. My only issue is the way the material now looks after multiple times worn and washed. The fabric is now showing minute piling and no longer looks crisp and new. Knowing that this shirt doesn't maintain its integrity after repeated use, I would not completely recommend this purchase."
3.0,I loved the style of the dress however the size chart was wrong. The large fit like a small.
3.0,"I guess good for the price or cosplay.  Coins don’t stack because the stamping left the inner details thick, rising above the outer lip of the coin.  Also has a hole in the top of the coin.  I know it was in the picture, but not sure why it’s necessary.  The print on the coin is barely readable.  Just not impressed, but ok as long as you understand what you’re getting."
3.0,Nice watch...
3.0,"Not the best quality, the turkey earrings broke after one day of wearing."
3.0,"Its a cool watch, but is small and nothing like the picture."
3.0,"A little tight, hopefully it'll stretch with time.  Shipping time was long"
3.0,"To begin with, the sleeved come only to the elbow (not as shown) and in sleeping they scoot and bunch up. It's comfortable enough but I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"Love the feel. They fit perfect. Only reason a three is because of the piling between the legs after 1 time wearing them. Bigger thighs that is why I like to wear yoga type pants. The balling cannot be seen by others that I know of, but bugs me. Feel like are going to thin out there quickly"
3.0,"I wish I could add a picture of the wand I did receive, but it was not the one pictured. The one in the picture is Star's final wand but the one I got in the mail was her second wand that if painted correctly is the broken star one. I still love it and it was printed great and was easy to put together but my daughter was expecting the one pictured and was super disappointed. :(."
3.0,This is a beautiful set but instead of Miami Beach it says Miami's Beach.  Silly!
3.0,Only one of them would open. :/
3.0,"Love the color.  I do not like the stiffness of the band; I expected it to be ""leather-like""."
3.0,i get it from a friend is ok
3.0,only plays one song/beat
3.0,The arm holes are big - but still looks great under a jacket
3.0,It is comfy not a soft cotton .idk what it is made of .its not see through and kinda thick material .spongy like
3.0,"Way TOO BIG!.<br />I tried to go off the chart, but after reading the other reviews I thought I would be fine with my normal size. ehhh Wrong on that one.<br />I am 5'8 - average build (usually wear a M/L) and this made me look like I was wearing a potato sack that was 2 sizes too big. If I decide to repurchase I will go with the smallest size."
3.0,owner did not complain
3.0,"I orderd two shrugs both advertised as ""Biadani"", one mustard and one green.  The green one (which is being reviewed) had a tag ""All Yours"" and is made with a soft wrinkly material which was crumpled and wrinkled like a rag and had to be ironed. However it fit well and I kept it. The tag on the mustard shrug was ""Cielo"" , same as one I had previously ordered (rust) but which was advertised as being ""Arc Studio"". I am happy with the ""Cielo"" brand.  Unless you understand fabric compositions well, examine the tag on the item before purchasing."
3.0,Me agrado que viene todo incluido co. Su peluca y accesorios
3.0,They are a little thinner than most of the other socks I have tried.
3.0,"The purple cuffs were printed on the black instead of being its own separate piece. It worked for the costume, but was still disappointing."
3.0,Dress is VERY sheer. I won’t be able to wear it except as a bathing suit coverup unless I can find a slip that is low-cut enough. It’s soft and has a nice shape especially after I cinched it with an elastic hair tie.
3.0,Neck is too narrow.  Polyester material feels very cheap.  Runs larger than size.  Pocket on this type shirt is not attractive.  Wouldn't recommend.
3.0,I wear a small in almost every brand. This small was way too small for me.
3.0,"Unfortunately, I'm returning this shirt. It's a great color and design (loved the buttons), but the arms were WAY too small even though the rest fit okay. I thought I was going to rip the seams trying to get it off."
3.0,was kind of small
3.0,They are a little flimsy.
3.0,Thought they were cotton briefs
3.0,"Just received this today from India. It is okay, but the pink/red and blue colors are a lot brighter than in the picture. I received and saw this kurti a couple months ago, but had to return it because it was the wrong size (with free return). The kurti's colors a couple months ago were nice, pastel shades of pink and blue like in the picture, which I think is MUCH prettier and which I much prefer to the the bright colors of the version I just received in the larger size (without free return). I am a bit disappointed, but will still use the kurti."
3.0,"Too big for me, but it's nice otherwise. I guess I just have a small neck."
3.0,I returned it because it didn't have anu actual Stones and looks cheapy to me. I received a fee compliments but it just wasn't my style and was not what I expected. The claspwas a little difficulty to open at times.
3.0,nice but wrinkles a lot
3.0,"Screw came out after only 2 weeks, maybe worn 3 times. My husband is in construction, while it knocked off some glare, it was not enough for him."
3.0,"Overall quality was very nice. I liked the overall style/ shape but followed the size chart and ended up having to return. I usually wear a sz small, (34C) but thought I'd better used the chart because I've ordered from Romwe before & their sizes run very small.  No dice. I ordered a large but it was WAY too big. I'd say order your normal size, don't follow the chart."
3.0,"This is a perfectly adequate tie if you can get it cheap. It is sized for a normal sized adult or teenager.<br /><br />I think it is made out of polyester or some other synthetic material. There isn't any sort of tag on the tie to say what material it is made of.<br /><br />I think the tie was dyed after it was sewn together. Patterns match up at all of the seams, and the underlying fabric is white.<br /><br />I like the sunflower pattern. There are the vibrantly colored flowers in the foreground and black/white silhouettes of flowers in the background.<br /><br />Be careful washing it, the seams might not hold up, and I don't know if the dyes are set in the fabric. You could iron it, but it might make it more shiny than it already is.<br /><br />It's a decent tie with a fun pattern."
3.0,"I ordered two navy blue shirts by mistake. When they came neither was true navy. They were two different lighter shades of blue. Both were evenly dyed, one a slate gray/blue and the other a faded navy. The price was very good and I didn't have shirts those two colors so I kept them."
3.0,Very bulky...
3.0,the earrings were much larger than i expected. I wish there was a picture of it on someone to see before i bought it.
3.0,"I love it, its really cute but I wish it would fit. I don't have big ears, I have been told many times they're tiny. I tried putting this one and it dug/cut into my skin and stung. I wish I could wear it, but I can't. Really frustrated and disappointed."
3.0,After basic daily cleaning with microfiber cloth the lenses scratch and the material comes apart. That never happened with my original lenses. Not what I expected for the price
3.0,"Awesome print, but fit small in the chest and arms and larva round waist. T-shirt material was really thin. I wanted to keep it but, I know after one wash it wouldn't have fit at all."
3.0,Necklace is nice but chain cheap and broke easily
3.0,Muy suelto en la cintura
3.0,"It will be tolerable once I have money to tailor it. I used it for a Nancy Drew costume, which was fine, but to wear it for everyday use definitely needs some adjustments."
3.0,I didn't realize this was a Hi-Lo dress based on the photos. Very comfortable material.
3.0,"This dress is pretty cheap, and just FYI, it is pretty see through. I have two of the Elise Bloom dresses. The other is also cheap and see through. At least this one is a little bit longer, but still, this is not a church outfit, this is a, ummm, hitting the club outfit. If you are looking for something that can be worn in the daylight and not look overly risque, I would keep looking."
3.0,Should of ordered a size bigger.
3.0,"These are okay for the price, not much to say."
3.0,I'm a 12/14 I ordered a XLarge and it was extremely big
3.0,"This sweater is cute and soft but it’s WAY more cropped than I expected it to be… I mostly have midrise jeans and I definitely won’t be able to wear this with those without my stomach showing (which I’m not personally comfortable with).. but if you’re looking for a cropped sweater, I would definitely recommend this one! It’s good quality, warm, and comfortable"
3.0,The material is thin but light. The area under the breast area is too tight unfortunately. This will probably not last but a few washes. The pattern is like the picture. I will not purchase again.
3.0,"So I bought these to try and see if they would work for my nose piercing. Well they do, they fit comfortable in my nose. But unfortunately the balls kept coming off, day 1 I lost one so as you can see I have 2 didn’t studs in. It’s been 4 days and I just lost the other 🤦🏽‍♀️ They just keep turning. The other bad thing about using these studs in your nose is that it’s not flat, so it looks like a pimple to me lol"
3.0,Looks cute on but it's definitely cheap quality and product. when walking with the glasses on it rattles...  I definitely would not buy it again.
3.0,"They are quality sunglasses, but too large for me, but I kept them anyway.  I wish they would show these on a human face so you can get the idea of the size."
3.0,Used it with my bead necklace
3.0,It's a ok product..good for the price..it does run small I ordered a large and had to loosen it up a lot for me to get it on..it's a underbust which is cool but I don't like how it sticks out at the top where the underbust is...but overall the product is pretty cool it does look nice under clothes besides the top part sticking out
3.0,It didn’t fit like I expected.
3.0,Really loved this item and very comfy. But for a 2x i was hoping it would be a little bigger.
3.0,"It is a nice suit. I have purchased the same  one before. This one seems a tad bit smaller. (mostly it seems to be lower in the neckline). It does fit and wear well. I swim daily, hope this one holds up well."
3.0,"Love these, except they have a small hole on them and I only wore twice. :-("
3.0,So far a great semi-lightweight Jacket. But I cannot find the Muff Pocket for my Cellphone. False advertising again. Yes it was a selling point for me. As I said in another review on clothing purchased online - It's kinda potluck on receiving exactly what you think you ordered. My fault -Won't order clothing online again.
3.0,"I really wish the size XL would not add extra length.  I think the fit would have been fine, but it's too long for me.  I can either bunch it up below the knee, try an smooth the fabric down making it too loose around the ankle/calf or pull it over my knee which it won't stay.  Too bad they can't make an XL size in the length of a Medium/Large for those of us freaks with weirdly sized limbs."
3.0,"Their sizing runs small, so keep that in mind when ordering.  I really wanted to love this skirt but it was so small when I got it.  The quality of the fabric is really nice though...I'm a curvy girl, so if you are thin and looking for a nice work skirt, this is a good one."
3.0,Tiny and very delicate.
3.0,It's cute but the clasp broke the right away when I opened it you get what you pay for.
3.0,Not true to size order next size up<br />Tears easilyy
3.0,"Soft quality wool fabric, love the color. Slim fit, made for flat tummies and lean body types. This will not tie in the back as shown on the model if you’re curvy. I’m 5’9”, average torso, 34 G-H, usually wear medium tops or dress size 8, pants size large or 8-10. This top ties snugly around my hips, makes it gap in the back instead of draping as pictured. I have two other Wooly brand shirts (one short sleeve, one tank top) in size medium that I like and wear regularly."
3.0,Worth the price you paid for
3.0,Really cute but not the color I was expecting at all. I got the orange/brown and its more of a fall color instead of summer
3.0,Not what I was expecting.  Fabric is very stiff and not stretchy
3.0,"Love the pendant, hate the chain. It looks cheap. I'll use a different chain."
3.0,Its cute. Its adjustable. Its a nice color. It comes wrinkled and good freaking luck. I am still trying to get the wrinkles out. Washed per instructions (hung to dry and still wrinkled. Has been handing for months. Still wrinkled. Ironed for 30+ minutes. Still wrinkled. Sprayed with wrinkle release and hung up and you guessed it...still wrinkled. I planned on wearing it for family pics and while each thing I do its gets a little less wrinkly it might be worth it to get something else. Maybe its just me and the material hates me....
3.0,It was very pretty but I am tall for a lady 5 ft 10 in. and it didn't work for my figure.. so I returned it ! would be wonderful for a petite lady!
3.0,Smaller stones but pretty for casual wear.
3.0,"I bougth this for my wife, nice color and size. First everything looks ok, but then we saw that one of the earrings back was missing."
3.0,"The fabric is extremely stretchy and has an odd sheen to it. It reminded me of dance or workout clothes. Although I followed the size chart, this seemed larger than expected. I probably would have been better off with an extra small. For me, this is a return."
3.0,Very interesting scarf - if you are another skull lover this just might be perfect for you!  This seller is outstanding and I received my scarf before the due date. This seller will make sure you are satisfied with your purchase.  This scarf is exactly as shown (just might be a different color depending on which color you order).
3.0,"Pay attention to the sizing chart!<br /><br />This is a trapeze dress. It's not just a loose fit, but cut much wider at the bottom than at the top. I took a note from when of the others who left a review here and used a pin on the inside of the dress to pull it in.While that makes it look better on the body, it does make that side a bit shorter and just pushing the line for office appropriate. It's cute enough - it's great if you live in a hot climate. If you're hippy (like me- and no I don't mean plus size, just a true hour glass) I would be weary. I bought this thinking it would just be a cute super lose though not terribly flattering summer dress that would be worth it for the comfort, but as others mentioned, where the pockets fall on top of the extra material it's beyond not flattering."
3.0,Rips way too easily.. two holes within a month. Nice jacket though.. love it
3.0,Fabric is pretty on one side.  I knew when I ordered it was made of rayon (inferior fabric).
3.0,"It is beautiful, but it’s really big. Luckily it has a bow to tie in the back so help cinch in the waist. But it was bigger than expected."
3.0,"I hate buying these things, but since I break Pleasers' straps at LEAST once a month, I've avoided buying more stripper heels for at least a year and a half thanks to these replacement straps.  However, I break them ALL the time, they're weak along the seam and I have strong, extremely flexible feet.  Overpriced for what they are, but at least they've kept a much larger pile of plastic (many pairs of 8"" heel shoes) out of the landfills and allow me to keep my favorite, expensive, custom-painted Pleasers (whose straps broke less than a month after I got them😭) in my rotation."
3.0,These leggings are beautiful but thin. The top edge is not elastic (it was knitted too tightly) and I had to rip them a little to get them to slide over my calf. They were fine after that but hopefully they won’t unravel. I wear them over leggings and they stay fine!
3.0,socks look cheap...my granddaughter like them although I was disappointed.
3.0,"Its a cute clutch, BUT it has some lite stains and the flap isn't perfectly smooth, you get what you pay for. It'll do the trick, I just need it for one day. I gave it 3 stars because other than the flaws, the color is exactly as pictured and matches my sandals perfectly. Its an inexspensive bag, if it were one of my higher end bags then yes I would be more than annoyed with the flaws. This is a good little buy, if its a bag you wouldn't normally get."
3.0,"Although this has many pockets, most of the pockets are very SMALL.  The outside chest pockets do not fit a cell phone.  Most of the inside pockets are Velcro closure, which is NOT secure at all.<br />I could not even fit my checkbook in one of the zipped pockets.<br />NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
3.0,"These are okay, but definitely not good to drive with. Lol I consider these emergency sunglasses."
3.0,Not pre-tied. So hopefully someone knows how to tie a bowtie. Colors as very true to picture.
3.0,The material on this definitely feels really cheap and isn't the most comfortable. But you get what you pay for I guess! The size was great and fit me well.
3.0,Don't buy if your child is older than 4.
3.0,"I have this dress in gray and liking it so much, I chose to order it in burgundy as well. The color was nice, the material as I expected, but there was a very noticeable flaw in what I thought was the dye that ran down the center front from neckline to waist. I figured it was a one off and returned it requesting a replacement in its place. When the new one came, it had practically the same exact flaw. I didn’t take photos so I couldn’t say it was exact, but it was close. You might think that maybe they sent me the same dress again, but they couldn’t have because the two dresses were shipping at the same time. It’s unfortunate. I’ll now be looking for a burgundy dress elsewhere."
3.0,"The bridge is positioned so the sunglasses sit way too high on my nose, and I don't see any way to adjust this, If the glasses are supposed to sit this high, the lenses should be deeper to cover further down. As it is there is an annoying band of bright light across the bottom of my glasses. Nevertheless, I will try to get used to them, because I really like the idea of the flip-up feature."
3.0,My husband really likes the style. Fits him well. But it started pilling and then didn’t look so good.
3.0,I like the product but it was too small.
3.0,Good product good price point
3.0,"The ankles are very tight, and I have small ankles.cute though"
3.0,Never nice but size wrong not true to size get a size up
3.0,Very pretty but no way of staying on if the flowers are heavy. I would go with one that latches or is a full band next time.
3.0,"I loved this bag initially very cute, big, bold!”Loved it. But the straps haven’t held up as well as I had expected they would:("
3.0,Ripped as soon as I pulled it out of the package.  Seemed to be very cheaply made.
3.0,I ordered brown and received white in a different size.  Fit my sister.  Very narrow sandal.
3.0,They are very cute and my 2 year old loves them. Didnt want to take them off! Problem was the stitching on one of them is pulling up. We're going on vacation so I dont have time to send then back for replacement so I just hot glued them. They seem to be okay now.
3.0,Cute but much smaller then expected. Sizes range from 3 - 4. Only fit ring and pinky fingers.
3.0,"I have purchased other Novica products with no complaint. This ring though, just wasn’t as well made as the others. Very thin. This one ring will not deter me from purchasing from Novica again"
3.0,When I ordered these they didn’t arrive the first time even though it said I received them.  They did replace them at no cost and I had them in 2 days.  I was a bit disappointed though.  I really thought they would be much more shiny.  They look as though once they are worn for a bit they will look worse than they already do.  I wouldn’t order these again.
3.0,"They shrunk a bit after washing, but have enough stretch to fit a size 8.5. But barely.<br />Other than that pretty decent socks, low cut, and fairly comortable."
3.0,Nice color but a little tight.  Should have bought the next biggest size.  Live and learn...
3.0,really big and the back is weird i think she will think it is very cool and might not you never know
3.0,I like the look but the little chain and hook that hold it on your wrist broke off within the first few days. It was not expensive so I am not too worried about it. I will probably figure out a way to hang it from my car mirror.
3.0,bridge is spaced out too much
3.0,It's thinner than I expected but it's still cute.
3.0,A little tight fit than what the size supposed to be.
3.0,"It feels like the infamous &#34;slim fit&#34; shirt which i don't care for. Tight in the rib area, nice color combo,"
3.0,"The quality of the gloves is good for the money, but my critique is concerning the ""one size fits all"" size description. My hands are by no means considered large, but I had difficulty getting the gloves on my hands and thought I would end up tearing the material trying to remove them.<br />Not really a happy camper on this purchase."
3.0,Great.  One was stuck together....they are strong!
3.0,"First for the pros: The quality of this product is amazing. Very thick denim, great looking.<br /><br />For the cons: as other reviews state, these run small. I am typically a 14/16 and an XL, so I ordered a 3XL in this. It fit, but it was very fitted in the hips, and I was hoping for something a bit more baggy there. These overalls are also very LONG. I am 5'6&#34; and had to roll them up 3 times. I was fine with that, because it looked cute, but just for a warning.<br /><br />I definitely debated on keeping this, but I am going to go ahead and send them back. It's just too fitted in the hips. When I sat down, everything rolled and bulged in all the wrong directions! haha<br /><br />Definitely be sure to order two sizes up, and, if you are wanting baggy or lose, it would probably be best to not be above a 12/14 size when ordering a 3XL."
3.0,"The top portion was too small.  The bottom portion was too loose.  I did order a size bigger than what I am,  based on the other reviews,  but the top portion was still too small. Bottom portion was a good length though.  Didn't ride up when I tried it on.  I will return it."
3.0,Dress seemed fine but was pink instead of red
3.0,The purse was much too small for me. The pure is gorgeous for a girl.
3.0,"I read other reviews saying it runs pretty small.  It runs VERY small.  Also, I was hoping the color (purple) was close to the picture - it was actually a little darker and not great.  I returned it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:90aca74b0b8548eb4f1edfe2aef296fa]] Bubble artifact in gold leaves.
3.0,"Received it at the date it said it would arrive and the mask looked awesome, but it was too small. Spoke to the seller and was given a partial refund. Basically, this mask would fit a child's face or someone who's as small as them, but not an adult."
3.0,"Sleeves are tight, colors are like the picture. returned it."
3.0,"Was way bigger than I expected, but the quality was pretty good"
3.0,Fits great just disappointed they arrived with a black scuff mark on one of the boots.
3.0,"the shorts look great but the sizing chart is off. i order an xl but what i got was like 3 sizes under me, because these are imported from the U.K. and they use the Metric system.  so a xl will be a med size and not xl."
3.0,"It is a great concept, but lacks some styling on the waist area.  It is a bit chunky there."
3.0,"For the price (cheap) this bag was fine and arrived fast, as I needed it to. However, it wasn't as big as I thought it would be. Nor were the straps as long as I needed or expected. And the quality is pretty cheap. But I needed it quickly for a business trip -- I thought it would be a good carry on bag and bag to tote things around all day, and it was."
3.0,After receiving this in the mail I immediately tried it on. After about 5 mins I had to take it off because it was really scratching the inside of my middle and pinky fingers. Too bad bc it is really pretty.
3.0,"Doesn’t fit like the pic, don’t go off the arm. Just fits like a regular loose shirt."
3.0,This shirt is cute and comfortable but you have to pull it down to hang off your shoulder like the one in the picture.  It doesn't stay down so it's quite annoying to keep readjusting it.
3.0,"The gloves sometimes do not turn on (try unplugging and replugging in the batteries). Other times they seem to turn off themselves. One of the batteries does not last as long as the other one. However, when they work, they do keep most of the hand warm."
3.0,I originally bought this because I had an old one for upper back pain and my workouts. I was hoping this would help. It kind of did but it wasn’t for me. The product was super solid and I’m sure someone else could benefit from it. I gave it four stars because I love the intention but it wasn’t what I was looking for
3.0,Not all were good but nothing that could be done. Had losses on this shipment
3.0,"This fits very nicely! However after I hand washed, and line dried the nightgown,  it ripped away from the seam near the straps. I'm a bit disappointed because it fits really well."
3.0,"It's a lot lighter than I expected & feels cheap. The distressing is nice. I got purple. It looks really costumey. Other than that, not bad. I'd wear something underneath unless you're comfy showing your bare nips."
3.0,"Super cute, but runs VERY big. I bought my normal size and it was a dress."
3.0,Ok/ this is a really cute AND functional sports bra. I’ve worn it not only to the gym- but washed it and wore it under a see thru mesh shirt. The stretch is great but it holds everything in place- I’m a 32-34B. I do HIIT workouts. The material is soft and smooth. It washes fine. I’m actually really glad to have a white bra- mine are all dark or colored and this one is really versatile. If you’re looking for white- get it! It has the padding- so no embarrassing see through action…
3.0,"Got an XXL and it is STILL too small... I'm a bigger dude - 5' 9&#34; and 230lbs and stocky. My biceps are about 14.5&#34; around while relaxing, and these sleeves squeeze.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great length, I needed something to cover from wrist to almost my armpit, these are the perfect length.<br />- These have a sort of rubberish black band (but it doesn't pinch like rubber would) in the bicep area that holds in place perfectly. This is great, but is also partially a con... it adds to the tightness of the bicep area.<br /><br />Cons<br />TOO TIGHT! The fabric itself is great, breaths and is comfortable and not tight, but the black band area is much too tight for being XXL. They DO stretch significantly, but the pressure of the band makes it uncomfortable to wear for longer than 30 minutes.<br />I have tried to pull and stretch the black band area to try and see if I can get it a bit looser, but no such luck.<br /><br />It does the trick, but it's not perfect."
3.0,"I gave it three stars, not for quality or design - it is a great dress. Form fitting in the right places, deep black color - it is just a bit shinier than I like.  When I am thinking casual or work, I am not thinking a shiny polyester blend.  I tend to prefer a more spandex cotton blend for that to work and then off to night look.  Otherwise great dress."
3.0,Runs small had to make it work need it for this weekend wedding
3.0,These are cute and fit well but then they ride up throughout the day and I am constantly having to pull them down.
3.0,No offense but I had other expectations. Especially for the price....I gave it three stars because they’re medium size and because my face is a little bit round I expected them to be just a little bit bigger but I still enjoyed the purchase and I will tend to wear them
3.0,"The dress is cute in the picture.  When it arrived, I did not like it's appearance.  It is being returned."
3.0,"The fabric is amazing. Super soft and smooth. I love the phone pocket! The waistband is about 2in wide but only has elastic in the top inch, which causes this to roll. Now, if you have a flat tummy you won't have this problem. They are a tad longer than I wanted and bunch just a bit at the knee."
3.0,Cute chokers but concerned they will rip easily when I wear them out. In addition I got 2 pairs of the same necklace instead of the one I actually wanted and was the reason I purchased the 10 pack. Pretty much disappointed with my purchase so far...
3.0,I got the multi colred ones. Nice but smaller than expected- that is on me for not understanding the scale.  Earrings themselves were not as vivid as picture.
3.0,Good for a rennesaunce festival
3.0,"My grandson wears size 8T & he's 7. The Med should have fit him, but this was made for a tiny little boy. Nicely made raincoat, that he'll not get to wear."
3.0,Thin but nice. Not sure how it will hold up in the long run. But I like it for now.
3.0,"Shipped surprisingly fast, I got it in the mail two days after I'd ordered it.<br /><br />Little unexpected was that each figure is coated black on the back. It's not really bad, but it was a surprise. The chain is simple and fine for the price. It fits a little big if I put it on the last chain link but you can also just hook it anywhere you'd like."
3.0,"The dress arrived on time as promised. For the price it's an OK dress. The material isn't great but if you want great you should probably go to Dillards, Norsdtroms or a store like that. I wear size 14 and have a bit of a stomach.  I bought the XXL. If you are well proportioned and don't have any bulges this will be great on you. If not, don't even try it!!!"
3.0,"Watch is great, but it will just stop for no reason. I thought the battery was dying, but the battery tested great."
3.0,"very thin, ok for sun and dirt.  but not for any other use."
3.0,One of the two long chains by the crystals broke the day I got it. I put it together and used it bc they look pretty good... but fragile
3.0,Very thin and not what I expected
3.0,"Top top is a little large, but overall a good product."
3.0,"I like the band itself. I currently have a magnetic mesh band, but the magnet constantly disconnects. I prefer the clasp, despite it being slightly less convenient to put on/take off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can’t get one side of the strap to click into place on my watch. I have three other bands that don’t have this issue - one silicone and 2 metal - so I’m confident it’s the band and not my watch face. I haven’t yet reached out to the supplier but will update if I hear back from them."
3.0,"Top fits nice, bottom is kinda tight"
3.0,"Cute colors, but tight"
3.0,The dress is really pretty but they send the wrong color 🥺😭
3.0,Lovely dress but I had to go up two sizes to get the fit shown on the model.
3.0,"I have only had these since yesterday afternoon, so I cannot give a 5 star.  They seem ok.  The fit is as stated, comfortable if you like stiff nubs on the bottom of your feet! We will see, I wore them today for half hour and did get used to the hard nobby surface."
3.0,"- not really a sweatshirt,  more of a warm thick long sleeve shirt<br />- low quality (see pics of strings / stitching along zipper)<br />- zipper access for boobs are not ideal for my large beasts ... it is awkward to get boobs out"
3.0,"Replaced the leather strap on my Samsung Gear S2 Classic. Fits the device and adjusts perfectly to my wrist. No complaints or issues with this product.<br />UPDATE: I wear my S2 while working at my computer. The buckle and a bit of the strap rest on my desk as I type. This has caused the black finish to wear off, exposing the natural silver color. Not exactly a deal breaker but be aware that the finish is only skin deep."
3.0,"The glasses are very good for the price, but the heart shape was much more round than I had expected. Although the colors are exact to the picture, the shape of the heart lenses are slightly rounder than pictured. Also took 3 weeks to arrive... Still a great product for the price, and came with a protective bag!"
3.0,Shorts is ah no . Top is cute but not what I expected. It’s a cute outfit if u like shorts that come up to ur chest
3.0,I struggle to close the earrings because the back is kind of confusing
3.0,I liked the glasses but some times when I go into a building I need to take them off.  Like many others i put them on the top of my head.  The designs on the sides of the glasses get caught in my hair.  I literally have to pull my hair out to get them off.
3.0,cheap quality and small
3.0,Good fabric a little tight for my style
3.0,"The sleep cap is beautiful in appearance; however, it seems to run small in size; and appears to have less material than as pictured.  My head is not large; and even though I ordered a Medium, it barely fits.  The picture shows a loose fit, yet if my hair was any longer, it would be too small.  Again, it's a beautiful pink color and appears to be of good quality.  If I had known that the caps apparently run small, I would have ordered a size larger than that recommended in the size guide."
3.0,Cute pants but you have to be very tall to  show off the cut
3.0,"To short, pulls out."
3.0,Like the style but the arms didn't fit right.
3.0,The pearls have discoloration on them -  they dont look brand new
3.0,ARRIVED ALL CRUMBLED EVEN AFTER A WEEK CREASES STAYED. WAS A GIFT!...
3.0,Made extremely large I would say one or two sizes down for a child and the blue ones rub my child's heal so he's unable to really wear them very often so they are beautiful shoes
3.0,masks are small in size!  should be for children
3.0,It just took longer than they originally said but all in all it was<br />Great to receive it and they kept me updated as well.
3.0,"The colors are different, more on the navy side than purple and teal."
3.0,I bought this for my girlfriend. She loved it but said that it felt cheap.
3.0,"Love the jersey, but the zipper has been broken after wearing a dozen times.  The quality needs improvement!"
3.0,"One of the reasons I opted for these glasses is that the descriptio  says they are spring hinges. They are not. As a matter of fact, they feel like dollar store readers. I can tell that they do eliminate some of the blue light from the computer screen, but I'm still not in love with them. They just feel cheap."
3.0,"This blouse is pretty and a pretty color. The fabric is soft and not too see through. I like the shirttail hem.<br />But I expected this to fit me more like it fits the model and it doesn't.<br />I am 5' 5.5"" and 136 lbs 36D. I have a little tummy.<br />I thought this would be a more forgiving shirt and be looser around the middle but instead it's a little big in the shoulder and top but tight around the middle.<br />Disappointed in the fit."
3.0,This line of apparel based on this pair of pants is geared almost exclusively toward a younger and thinner demographic which I am neither of. The material is of quality workmanship and the color is great.
3.0,"Love the design, love the color (well. . .black) but the size is sort of misleading.  I was expecting a US size garment, but I think the sizes are for tiny women and not for larger American women."
3.0,"I was hoping that even though they were cheap boots that I'd still be happy enough with them, but they are too tight on my calves and I do not think I have overly large calves. They were as pictured though, decent quality for the price, except maybe for the ends of the straps showing where they were cut by the zipper? Thought that was odd."
3.0,"No light on the back of the hat, and scarf is not a full scarf you hook it thru a hoop"
3.0,Fabric too loose
3.0,While the dress is super cute it was not like the picture i ordered. There was no Mackey or polkadot on the dress. Just Minnie mouse. A little disappointing.
3.0,yellows not sewn on same pattern as other colors. yellow has more awkward fit with extra seam running toes.
3.0,Too shiny for me. So I returned them.  Nice quality fabric.  Look to be well made.
3.0,Love it for around the house but it runs way too small for the gym (for me) and it's so itchy around the arms.
3.0,Should've gotten a large. & it came smelling like cigarette smoke
3.0,The glasses are sturdy and work well for night riding.
3.0,About 2/12 in each package did not function.
3.0,"this dress is for tall women , am 5.5 ,  I now have to take it to he tailor to have it shortened"
3.0,"The ring looked as pictured and what I expected.  EXCEPT, I ordered a size 8 and was sent a size 7 (even though the packaging said it was size 8),  so I returned it.  I am 100% positive I was sent a 7 because I compared to several size 7 rings that I have.  I didn’t exchangeable for a real size 8 because I didn’t want the hassle of having to return another one if the didn’t get it right again.  Had the sizing been correct, I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,The sweater looked amazing. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that the material wasn’t as good as I was expecting it to be.
3.0,I am very petite so I ordered a size 1. It fit my waist fine but the legs are a bit baggy and long. I wish I could've ordered a size 0. These pants runs big.
3.0,They are a lot shorter in length and thinner than I thought they would be but ok for the price.
3.0,comfortable but the wrist length need to be longer. It barely covers your wrist.
3.0,"Pretty good design but, the material feels a bit cheap but the stitching was done well!"
3.0,"I purchased these Goggles specifically because the description indicated they would work over prescription glasses. As both my wife and I wear them, this was a requirement. The goggles did not work over our glasses. Sure you could put them on over your glasses, but they pressed your glasses into your face and were very uncomfortable. If you are looking for Ski Goggles to fit over your glasses, buy something else. These do not. They may be good goggles otherwise, I never found out."
3.0,"This bag is large and the color is nice, however it is not very durable. The plastic material feels rather thin and when the bag is full, it is awkward to carry."
3.0,Nice and warm and soft but the material sheds all over the place.  I wonder how long they will last.
3.0,Like this dress but sizes were a little off
3.0,This runs very small. It was shipped directly from China.
3.0,Poor quality.  Fits as expected.  Shoe fell apart at seams very quickly
3.0,Color is a lot darker than pictured looks more Dark green but I still really like it.
3.0,"Very cute, definitely cheap though. Could find something similar at walmart for cheaper."
3.0,"This watch looks amazing for the price! I got a lot of compliments on it and everyone thought it was so expensive! The only bad thing is that the gold color on the band has faded. The gold color has now turned into a silver color, but the head of the watch has stayed gold. No one has really noticed the band color change so it's not anything completely horrible. Overall, a good buy in my eyes."
3.0,"It is beautiful. My only issue with it is the barbell is stainless steel, but the cuff itself must be nickel plated? I had to take the cuff off after I had a reaction to it."
3.0,"I love this charm a lot......BUT....I am now on my second one because the first one fell off and lost it leaving me with just the lobster claw attached. I liked it so much I ordered another one and last night lost that one also....so as much as I like it , it needs to have a better design ."
3.0,Poorly constructed and the fabric is very thin
3.0,"They are comfortable from the first wear and look super cute.  However, during our daughter's first use of them, one of the straps broke. I have tried to figure out how to fix them but guess we will just cut both off to look uniform and let herget as much wear out ofnthem as possible. :/"
3.0,nice bag but strap is starting to unravel.
3.0,Cheap glasses that are OK when you want to wear something you don't mind breaking or losing.
3.0,"The hat was much too small, I had to give it away."
3.0,"Really liked the design and the fit of this jersey, but the zipper broke after a few uses."
3.0,Bought these for my wife as of yesterday on of them crumbled while we were sleeping. Quality is subpar but shipping was fast and they were beautiful pieces.
3.0,"Light weight, it would be perfect for summer."
3.0,"I ordered a 22mm wide band and received what I believe is a 20mm wide band. This results in a gap showing the spring bars, as shown in one of the photos.<br /><br />Other than the width issue, the band seems acceptable. I've only had it a couple days, so time will tell.<br /><br />It seems a bit shorter than other nylon watch bands I've had in the past - there are only four larger holes than the one I use for the buckle. I have fairly large wrists for a woman, so it might fit a fair range of people, but not those with extra large wrists."
3.0,"This Rilney tote is very pretty, summery even. Unfortunately, it is very thin. It has a denim looking body with brown/tan (leather) handles and bottom. It is lined. I expected something a little heavier or more substantial. This is more of a gift bag or beach bag. As a matter of fact, this bag is perfect for a beach trip (which is where I’d be if it weren’t for this pandemic). I can definitely see carrying a small wallet, a paperback novel, suntan lotion and sunglasses in it, but wouldn’t recommend putting anything too heavy in it.  So, while I am disappointed (that it isn’t more substantial), I am sure that I will find a use for it."
3.0,"This jacket is really cute and actually fit just right EXCEPT the drawstring rode up too high making it look like an empire style on me. Not very flattering. I have been looking for a light rain jacket like this for a long time and thought this was it. Not sure how dry it would keep me as the material is pretty thin. If not for the drawstring issue, I would have kept it but am returning it."
3.0,I love this dress so comfortable and sexy... but it also came with a hole in the seam that I have yet to repair so I couldn't really water it anywhere
3.0,But the thread does comes apart
3.0,Very nice bow tie but just know you have to tie it yourself. Bought it for my teenage son and neither of us knew how to tie it.
3.0,"They're pretty, but easily breakable because they're hot glued together. My daughter broke them all in under a month, but they were still fun and cheap enough that it wasn't a big deal."
3.0,I simply though the material would be of better quality - but it's ok.
3.0,I originally ordered a medium and it was a little small so I got a large and they fit pretty much the same
3.0,I'm returning it because I don't like the sheen of the material. It looks like a really nice dress till I got it and realized it was a shiny material which kind of turned it into a not every day dress for summer that I was looking for. Also order a size up if you want it to feel flowing.
3.0,"This belt is very nice! The only thing I didn’t like is that the front part is a different material. The sides by the buckle are like a leather material, and then at your hips it switches to a stretchy band. It doesn’t look as professional as I hoped, but it works with casual dresses."
3.0,"Aside from being smaller than its predecessors, I was very disappointed in this bag.  I'm going to stick to my Everyday Messenger V2."
3.0,"These are nice until one breaks apart from the watch.  I was able to re-attach it....so, it's ok."
3.0,This was a gift; the recipient enjoyed it.
3.0,"Its cute but the waist is too high, so it is too young of a style for someone in their 30's-40's"
3.0,Too small for a 4 T.
3.0,These are unable to be wore with braces because of the needed extra elevation in the toes. But will hang on to them in case her feet grow enough to wear without braces. (She really loves them)
3.0,"I bought this not really expecting much of anything,  so I was presently surprised.  It does a pretty good job of suckling everything in.  I was afraid of going too small,  (My waist is 44 inches and I bought the black (non-latex) in a 2XL) but I  could've easily fit into a 1XL.<br />However,  I had 2 problems.<br />First,  while the bones are great, having one run down the center of the back was not a good idea.  Within a few wears,  that one buckled and created a painful pressure point on my back. (It doesn't help that I spend most of the day sitting) This was no big deal though,  as I simply cut that particular bone out of the seam.<br />The bigger problem,  however,  is that the trainer is too short.  I myself am 5'9'', so maybe it works better on a shorter person.  I always have to choose between the bottom of my stomach getting suffocated,  or having back chub spilling out of the top, as it's too short to hold in both at once.<br /><br />Overall,  I'm mostly satisfied.  Considering the price,  you're definitely getting your money's worth."
3.0,Sizing is really off they are really small.<br />They fit a lot tighter I had bought for my son and gave the neutral colors to my 11 year old daughter who wears a size 5 in shoes and they fit perfect but didn't fit my son at all.
3.0,Order a size up if you want it a little give. Great for the price.
3.0,It’s such a cute dress and so soft! But I ordered a small and it fits me more like a medium. I don’t think I will wear it as much as I thought due to that fact.
3.0,"For the price I was still pretty happy with the product, but it is a little misleading. It looks almost exactly as it does in the photo, however it is a thin polyester/spandex/Tech like material, not the thicker material you would typically think of for a sweat shirt. Also for the sizing, look at the chart and then maybe even still go up a size.. My daughter is 5' 2"" and 98lb with a very small/lean frame and I had to get her a lg.. she typically wears and xs or s."
3.0,Not the best quality but still looks good.
3.0,"this dress is from SheIn and is available for half the price on their website (of course without the prime shipping).<br />Despite that the dress is super cute, lightweight and comfortable. It’s a bit short so shorts underneath are a good idea."
3.0,A little big should have gotten a 10.5 I tried a 11.0
3.0,It was nice just did not have that right feel
3.0,"The item was as described, lightweight, true blue color and a decent size. It is more on the small size like I like. However, I did not particularly like the blue color once I received the ring. Also, the fit was a little off and it came out after a couple weeks."
3.0,Nice hat but not made in the USA. Would be nice to know this before purchase.
3.0,Every time I take this key chain out of my pocket my primary ignition key for my vehicle is twisted up and locked into the carabiner clip just because of the distance between the ring and the clip. It's a beautiful key chain there is just something strange about the distance between the rings that makes it's a pain to use in real life... I find myself having to sit down and work it out like one of those silly puzzle toys in order to get my key twisted out of it so that I can start the darned car.
3.0,Did not cut the glare.
3.0,Fits as expected but looks more like a pajama top
3.0,Rinkles toeasily a little big for a petite woman like me
3.0,"Product doesn’t appear to be the neoprene material from dive suits and they run small. Unfortunately not for me, may be for someone else."
3.0,"These are on the thin side, should be thicker to stay tied."
3.0,"I've had this last minute costume for a few years now and the headband just broke. Really not a big deal considering how little I paid, but if you're looking for something decent you might want to keep looking. The ears are cute, the bow is simple and small but not too small, but the tail.. the tail is sad. It's maybe a foot and a half long at best. Did the trick, though."
3.0,They look super fake and yes you get what you pay for the collar stays though are pretty amazing better than the cufflinks but the cufflinks look nothing like he pictures.
3.0,The apron is very cute but it’s way smaller than expected. It was purchased for my 9 year old and it looks to fit a 2 years old
3.0,feels and looks cheap. good thing it was
3.0,"The sizing was fine and as-advertised, but the material was not the greatest quality. (As can be expected for the price.) The colors were exactly as pictured, so it's a really cute swimsuit! But the bottoms ride up and the chest padding is low quality. Not sure that the suit would hold up over time."
3.0,"Very small. I would say they are around a size 8-9.5 in mens<br />We were not able to use these.  Too big for a girl<br />(I wear a size 6) and way to small for a guy. (Size 11 or 11.5) We tried to stretch them out for a week but it did not work...<br /> However, They seem sturdy and durable like they would not break.<br />We figured they would be more stretchy and would work."
3.0,"It's an OK dress. The fabric is acceptable. Im 5'7&#34;, 129.pounds and ordered Medium. It fits perfect, the length is just at the top of knees."
3.0,I love the patterns and material. Wearing them I feel like with time they may stretch more than my other elastic headbands would but I was wanting to try something better to protect my hair. Time will tell!
3.0,I love the top over all and it pretty but it fits very snug for a xl that’s my o my complaint
3.0,Cute but very snug for the size.
3.0,Great fabric and price but I wear a size 2/4 in most stores and the small-large size is almost too small after washing
3.0,"The chain broke--it is very delicate.  I bought a replacement chain.  The locket lost its clamping ability, so when it is worn, it just stays open."
3.0,"I ordered what I thought was black and they are more of a navy blue than black, which is frustrating because I wanted them to be black not blue.  🙄"
3.0,Good material and fit as expected
3.0,"Good lightweight material, dries extremely fast. Pants were a little too long inseam lies."
3.0,"fits well, just that the tank top is too long but the pats fit very well.<br />wish I could have upload a picture of my daughter wearing them :) very cute outfit for the price!"
3.0,Everything looks great but chain was broken on necklace. I would like the chain replaced n keep the rest
3.0,"The workmanship is good.  The stones are not as light and bright as in this picture, so I do not find myself gravitating to them.  Went back to wearing similar ones with pearl insets that reflect light much better.  Over all, I wouldn't purchase again.  The picture should be made more representative of what they will look like in use."
3.0,I like it but cheaply made
3.0,Very cute but heavy and uncomfortable. The hard plastic is not shaped smoothly around the bridge of nose like most glasses. Whenever my kids wear them they get indents in those areas. They like them but these are not go to glasses for long days in the sun or sports for sure!
3.0,"If you have a butt, hips, or boobs, this is a no-go. Unless you’re like 5’2” and get a large.<br />I wouldn’t have minded it being a bit snug, but the fabric doesn’t stretch at all."
3.0,Very boxy dress with no shape from chest down. Not slimming at all.
3.0,Comfortable.  I prefer a tighter fit for safety.
3.0,Ran much smaller than expected . Gave to a friend
3.0,"I love the fit of this shirt and it’s true to the provided description. However, I have only worn it once and have since noticed that it is ripped at the neckline near one of the pleats. So, nice but cheaply made."
3.0,bleep bloop bit bop lop loop pi fi tree bal saff te re rho fi fa fo fom coup tri
3.0,Fabric is stretch polyester. Fit is as expected. Not excellent quality. Ok for casual wear.
3.0,"This earring is cute but it's hard to keep it on place, sometimes it keeps falling."
3.0,It ok ..
3.0,Love the Green Paisley colors just not how the dress fit. I usually get an XL but like my summer dresses to be very loose so I ordered an XXL. The XXL fit tighter than a L. Too bad since I really like the colors and style.
3.0,There is nothing to this. Im not a buying cloth or material kinda gal if not I would have saved my money and done that. Overall it seems durable and it is comfortable to use.
3.0,"Beautiful watch, but doesn't last very long on a wind. After wearing it all day, I have a 50/50 chance of it being dead by morning. Unfortunately this I can't use it that way so I returned it."
3.0,Little small for my 10 yr old
3.0,Love the print.  Fit well in the chest and shoulders but seemed to taper at the waist a little too much. But it is the material sheerness that is making me return it. It's just too see through and dont think it would look good with a tank or cami underneath.
3.0,Perfect .
3.0,"My band looks great but the leather ""skin"" finish is very thin. Again, thick leather, thin fragile skin. On arrival I noticed a very conspicuous slit/crack in the finish of the band, at the top of the top lug loop for the top end bar. I used fly tying cement to completely make the damage dissapear. Look, band looks very nice but it is fragile, despite it's heft. I would not buy again for this reason. I contacted the company. Instead of offering an immediate replacement, they wanted pictures, which I provided. I provided pictures of the repaired band and they asked if they could use them for advertising! No offer of a discount, nothing. I won't be buying their products going forward, as I am unimpressed with customer service and the durability of a great looking but poorly finished product."
3.0,"Hello!!! I bought these with a “thought” in mind, I loved the fact that they were “basically” leggings with footies on them!! I was very excited when they arrived!!! However I noticed several “holes” in the fabric....just small ones, but they were all over!!! Luckily I know how to sew, so I just got a needle and some heavy duty thread, and just stitched them up.....you can see where I did it, but you’d have to be really staring at them for a while to notice, because of the striped pattern!!!! I love them so much, even though I had to work on them myself, so I ordered another pair today.....we shall see if the next ones have holes in them; if they do, I will no longer order them!!!! I will let you know as soon as I receive them!!!!"
3.0,This is a very nice hoodie. It has a super soft lining & feels like it would be quite warm. My problem was I didn't notice the fact that it has an interior zipper as well so you basically can't wear it unzipped.  Also the very wide bottom band is popular but not so good for a short older heavier set woman. I had to send mine back.
3.0,"Writing is very small and difficult to read. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, then this is a great choice. Packaging is very cute. I probably wouldn't have purchased this had I seen it in person beforehand, but your opinion might be different than mine."
3.0,"I have had these joggers for about two weeks and have worn them 3 times, washed twice. They have already started pilling on the front and back of the thigh area. I washed them inside out on cold water and laid them flat to dry. I am not sure what I could have done wrong. I read such good reviews on these pants so I am a little confused and definitely disappointed."
3.0,It fit great!! Too bad my breasts are too small to fill in the cups!
3.0,"I love the look of these frames, but as someone who washes their glasses regularly, I was surprised that the hinges began seizing up after a few months. I can't close the ear stems anymore to put them in the glasses case, so 3 stars it is."
3.0,Its fine if you get another chain
3.0,"Let be these, bigger than expected, get loads of compliments. They are hollow though so gave them 3 stars b/c not quite as advertised."
3.0,"Fits kind of odd, but will work for wearing around the house so not worth returning."
3.0,Great shirt but runs long.
3.0,I would've liked the glasses to be a little shorter. I didn't like the fact that it covered my entire eyebrows.
3.0,"Cute dress. And I really like the fabric. Only downside is it runs a little short. I don't mind the length where it hits on my thigh, but it is a little short for work. And the waist is higher than my natural waist, so I feel like I need to pull it down all day. Too bad, because other than that I really like it. And I LOVE a dress with pockets."
3.0,"Likes = great look & cheap to buy.<br />Dislikes = the watchbands & the finish does not hold up.<br /><br />In summary, you get what you pay for."
3.0,I liked it but wish the strap was longer. At its longest it didn’t come anywhere near my hip
3.0,This shirt was advertised as 100% cotton.  I checked the label on the shirt and it is 70% cotton and 30% polyester.  I called Amazon to complain and they refunded me a whopping $1.85 of an approximately $17 purchase.  I did not want to return the shirt since my partner liked it but he found it to be somewhat uncomfortable because of the polyester especially on a hot July day.
3.0,"Cheap , it slides off. Especially if you have large thighs."
3.0,Very beautiful but way super long...Got 5 inch heels and hoping to actually wear it...it's just too pretty not to!
3.0,The top doesn’t stretch much and is very tight on muscled thighs.
3.0,Nice material and comfortable
3.0,"Sharp looking, nice case....don't really see any difference in the night vision part of it....not functional"
3.0,"it’s really pretty but it’s from shein. and they don’t use pure 100% cotton. so it’s made of polyester. it’s short, it rides up if you have medium size boobs and very tight."
3.0,I’m a remodeler.  Just need a watch that stands up to life around construction.  These Casios do.  The light is awful on this one. My last Casio had a much better light.  Like the day and date feature.  Sometimes I get so busy I can’t remember what day it is.
3.0,"5' 9"" male; 135 lbs.<br />Ordered SMALL.<br /><br />Wanted to keep these, but they're simply too big for someone my size.<br />(The butt area feels especially generous, lol.)<br /><br />I have no issues with the color, material, or style."
3.0,"Sent back. Shoe slips off like you're wearing flip flops because the back of the heel is made of some sort of silky material. Unless you're okay with buying inserts of some sort, move along."
3.0,"There was nothing majorly wrong with the item but I sent it back because I wanted a real wrap, and it is not one. It also was not my style but it is cute on the model. Just not for me.<br />The color was very nice though."
3.0,"Not sure if it’s the screen-protector on my phone, but I cannot operate the touch screen while wearing these gloves."
3.0,"Fabric is soft and clingy.  To me the job of a slip is to prevent a skirt from clinging to hose.  If you're not wearing hose, and just need the slip to provide additional coverage under sheer fabric, this would be a great purchas."
3.0,Awesome product but way to small
3.0,These pants are super soft and comfy but I hadn't even worn them when I noticed about a three to four inch seam that had come apart on the side leg.<br />I tried to fix it myself but I am no seamstress.<br />Hopefully it holds up.
3.0,"These head bands are very cute and soft. Unfortunately they feel like silk, I did one hot bootcamp and within 2 minutes the band was slipping off and did not stay on. I took the head band off and didnt use it again."
3.0,This is ok! A little shorter than picture and a little wider. It’s a boxy fit and that’s not what the picture portrays!
3.0,It's more form fitting than I was hoping for. I wanted it to wear with leggings but it is so tight at my butt that it defeats the purpose. I need to wear a loose covering over this for modesty sake.
3.0,not very happy with them. They roll down when you sit so I'm constantly straightening the giant roll when I stand up. Need to find a low rise!
3.0,"It fits a little weird, really tight around the bottom, very loose on top. Nice and soft though."
3.0,"Good pants for work (I'm a server/maintance at a local resteraunt), i would go a size down if your interested in buying a pair"
3.0,"Pretty, but the embroidery started pulling out after the first wash on a delicates cycle."
3.0,"actually color is not so good as on the picture and not so bright red but the bag is ok. I liked it but it is fade red, anyway i liked it"
3.0,I returned. Was very disappointed in quality and fit. Boxy and not flattering at all.
3.0,"They fit tight, I bought a couple different brands and this one was my least favorite. I’m ok small, and you can see through the black. My mom wears the pink and she seems to like them, haven’t worn the orange yet."
3.0,It's good but was really tiny studs
3.0,Within the first few minutes the lace tore away from the top. Disappointing.
3.0,"The skulls are okay, they look sort of alienish in real life.  Quality of the earrings themselves is pretty good."
3.0,It doesn't fit men
3.0,"They are DEFINITELY long enough which is rare for my 6'7"" boyfriend, but he's not a fan of the material."
3.0,My daughter loves this. However a inside string broke off the day we got it.
3.0,This is not compression fit and should not be advertised as such! They are fitted! Otherwise they look great and the material is nice.  I'm just disappointed because I purchased these thinking I was getting a compression shirt which is what I need to help with pain after surgery
3.0,It's cool in concept but very easily broke within 24 hours or receiving it. It looks as pictured but the thickness around the plunger is very weak.
3.0,The dress was great the sizing was way off. Much smaller than expected. I was very disappointed. I had ordered similar dresses that were sleeveless and very nice. Was hoping this would be the same sizing.
3.0,Purchased these to hopefully wear to my new job but unfortunately I just didn’t think they looked flattering on my and I didn’t think they looked like proper office attire. I ended up returning them
3.0,"Very cute earrings but I was surprised to see how small they were when I got them. The metal bends easily so they are somewhat adjustable, but the tail doesn't reach the ear like the picture."
3.0,"However colors didn't meet expectations, so it is going back"
3.0,"A bit to small, but still wearable. Its only OK."
3.0,"It's perfect for what it is, and for what it's used for. Unfortunately as the picture shows, the white detail and the bottom angle cut is missing. So one you receive the item you have to make adjustments at the bottom hem and add a white edge. Other than that, the price is reasonable, the product is as described, it's cheap material tho but sturdy. So you can get a few comic con, Halloween, costume, and anime con adventures with this."
3.0,I was a little disappointed that it wasn't very loud.
3.0,"I could not even wear the top without my (nips) popping out of it. No matter what way I tugged, pulled, etc., it was not going to work. Cute concept, but not realistic. I like the high cut of the bottoms but I have to just wear them with a different top. I think I ordered a medium and I am 5' 2&#34; and fluctuate between 120-125 lbs. Cup size is 36 C. Hope this helps someone when making their decision...."
3.0,Too narrow for my feet. I dropped these off in a clothing donation box in my town.
3.0,I was expecting a thicker material and it did shrink after washing and drying. So it’s snug on me
3.0,"I typically wear a size 2X and found this size XXL fit pretty well.  I like the color, but quickly found that this style and cut was not particularly flattering to my pear shaped figure.  I also did not like the feel of the material, and was surprised that it was not softer.  All total, while I feel this might be a good choice for someone with a younger, slimmer figure, it just wasn't for me."
3.0,gave as a gift.  It looked cheap to me
3.0,beautiful earrings; clips feel a little too tight for my taste (others may find them to be just right)
3.0,I've been told they look good on me and that I should buy more which is why they get 3 starts and not 1 star. The picture on amazon is misleading making the jeans look really baggy. They are actually really uncomfortable to sit in and feel like they are just 1 notch away from being skinny jeans.<br />I like the baggy style so I'll look elsewhere... If you don't these will be fine for you.
3.0,"The dress is cute but very thin and clingy, not forgiving at all. Good if you’re firm! I’ll be wearing it around the house, or beach."
3.0,It runs very small. The small is a bit too tight so the medium would have fit better on me.
3.0,I ordered an x large.  I’m 6’0 245.  I have a muscular build.  I would suggest you order a size up. I love the feel of the material.
3.0,"These done all fit the same. I don’t know if it’s the shape or if it’s a size thing, but some where impossible to fit. I’ve also been through 3 because the gems have fallen out. Sometimes the prongs have gotten loose within a week and start catching on everything. That being said, the metal doesn’t irritate my skin which is great because I’m usually sensitive to that"
3.0,"Cute PJs and very pretty color, but the fabric does feel a bit cheap and always appears wrinkled. Also felt a bit boxy, I’m 5’11 and 155 lbs, the Large felt a little bit too short and wide."
3.0,Had to alter it.
3.0,"It looked beautiful in the picture but when I got it the material was very thin and see through. I wore bike shorts underneath. It still is a pretty nice skirt, flowey and bright. You can hardly see the pattern unless you look closely. Looks like you need to steam or iron it but it’s a nice skirt. Always love pockets which makes the skirt more functional!"
3.0,I'd say about a size smaller then I expected
3.0,"Not terrible but not fabulous. Top is large fitting, bottoms are small fitting."
3.0,"A cute top, but it's incredibly sheer."
3.0,"I like the look of this watch, and so far it functions fine.  My big issue is that I need a special tool and 5-10 minutes if i want to adjust the band size at all.  Plus the directions on how to preform this length change are a bit vauge."
3.0,Nice. Bought 3 as presents for my girlfriends daughters they liked them very much.
3.0,"I ordered a large and it fit perfect! I took the advice of a lot of people and it almost didn't fit my arms. Came in quicker than I thought. The shirt does look a lot like the picture but there's some parts that didn't. Something I definity did not like is the fact that the shirt is more squared than anything from the sides, it's not contouring to your curves at all, kinda like kids clothes. I did get complimented when I wore it tucked in with dress pants."
3.0,"Nice shirt but the sizes are smaller than noted. I wear a med. I ordered a large. It almost fit, just a little to snug. Gave it to my wife."
3.0,"The mask is ok, does not breath as well as I had hoped and the mask does not fit like the image.  The sides of the mask are pinch together and which alters the image a little."
3.0,This telescope prop was way too small.  Thought it would be bigger for some reason.
3.0,Runs really big. I ordered a medium and it looks and fits like a large.
3.0,"Love the dress! Make sure to order large enough as the material is see through it stretched at all. I have a large chest and this is more for a c or lower cup chest otherwise it gets see through in the chest area.  Mine came with a snag and I wanted to exchange, but my only option it gives me is to return...huge bummer. This is the second dress I bought, different colors and they both fit the same and are super cute!"
3.0,Don't buy if your kid has a big head. Bonnet was too small to fit my 3 year old.
3.0,"So I ABSOLETLY LOVED all of the checkers and how they looked, but when i put it on the clamp on the chain completely snaps (this has happen 2/8 times so far, i've only worn 3 of them so we'll see about the others) They came on time like they were supposed to, i just wish they didnt break."
3.0,The item was exactly like the picture and my granddaughter just loved it. It was prescribed just like she wanted it. The installing it on the watch was so easy. Great product
3.0,"It was very cute, but very loose at the bottom. The waist fit well but it was too long and far too loose for the style. It also felt very cheap, but this is to be expected for the price"
3.0,"The time received was fast. They are very small. I will order from them again, but read the description more carefully next time."
3.0,"It looks a little cheap,  but hey you get way you pay for."
3.0,"kind of see through, cute though."
3.0,"Was very small, like child size.  They did make the returning the product very easy though."
3.0,"Decent look, but the led lights are blinding if you are wearing this and they are on."
3.0,"This is an overall good deal with the exception that the main reason I bought these was for the yellow earring and my set didn't have them. Instead of yellow, I got two pairs of the tan/beige color which I didn't really care for.  The cost in time to return/shipping fee isn't worth the hassle soo..."
3.0,"I wish I could give these boots a higher rating because they do look nice, but the smell! I could not believe when I opened the box how strong the chemical smell was! I actually put the boots outside overnight thinking that would air it out but low and behold I wore them to work and now it is the end of the day and the smell is just as strong. I don’t know what they used on them but I wish I knew a way to get rid of the smell. It is truly so strong I don’t  Know how I can wear them again"
3.0,WAS DARK AND REQUIRED CLEANING AND POLISHING TO LOOK NICE.
3.0,"Edges are a bit sharp. Unlike a leather wallet there's no give, so you can feel it. Takes a little practice to get used to pulling/inserting cards without a major hassle."
3.0,"The neck is too small for the look they want. the fabric is a little itchy. it looks ok though, but nothing special about it. still, it is confy and I use it at home."
3.0,"Product has defect. It works, so not worth going through a return process."
3.0,it was ok. not worth the price
3.0,extra small=child size had to give these as a Easter Gift to a little girl who loves them.
3.0,"Like that it's heavy SS.  the shape of the chain doesn't slide as easily as rd chains. But alas, it's one size too big. Have to wait a year for Charlie to wear it."
3.0,I have fairly skinny legs yet I felt these fit a little too snug
3.0,It did not look well on my figure.  Very frumpy on me short and a little stocky. The material was nice and comfy however.
3.0,"Nice case, and seems well made, but I like softer, more compact cases, that slip easily into a pocket or hang on a belt or daypack.  This one is hard shell and bulky, maybe something you'd like in a workshop or kitchen or on a desk, where you didn't want your glasses knocked around or sat on.  Nothing wrong with the product, just not for my intended use.  Might be good for the pens I'm always losing in the clutter on my desk., because it stands out."
3.0,"These are appropriately weighty and well made, but they are most definitely darker than those pictured."
3.0,"Worked great for 9 months, then the case broke where the band attaches."
3.0,I bought these glasses for my son who had Lasik surgery to help with the glare when he drives. He said they really didn't help that much so I'm glad I didn't spend much money on them.
3.0,Cute but kind of cheap looking.
3.0,"Depending on where your bustline is, you might have risk of a booby popping out. My bust is pretty high up, so I definitely had some side boob showing on one end, with a bonus of potential nip slip in the center depending on the angle and what I’m doing (see pics). Aside from that, this bathing suit manages to be both sexy and somewhat modest (not that I particularly care about modesty). It has a relatively low cut leg, so it does not have a cheeky back at all, and the torso area is nipped in by a strong elastic fabric, as well as a liner. A note on the liner: the white in the back sometimes shows, depending on whether you have it tucked in just right or not.<br />Last thing: the bust pads are terrible. They look so obvious and unattractive, very cheap. Because they are not removable and also move around, I had to take 1.5 stars off of the review, bringing it down to three stars overall, making it just OK. Good bathing suit with a few small issues depending on the weather and activities."
3.0,These seem to run a big small. Returning for a larger size.
3.0,"I wasn’t impressed with this product. The print doesn’t look professional and it ran really small. Not good quality, unfortunately."
3.0,"These are way too long to wear with just regular shoes. When they say boot cut, they mean it has to be boots!"
3.0,They arr o.k just not for me
3.0,Bra is not supportive enough.
3.0,Pretty but very small you must have a tiny wrist to wear.
3.0,I ordered this skirt at a discounted price for my honest review and honestly this skirt is not made for an adult. Possibly a teenager or child anyone under 120 pounds or super slim. I give this skirt three stars because I was able to give it to my 12 year old so it wasn't a complete waste of my money. It does look cute on her and if she doesn't grow anymore we should be good for a couple of months with this skirt.
3.0,They arrived made of a copper/brass color I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for surgical steel. With that said after ge silver color feels off completely to reveal the copper core they look fairly good. Have had mibe for a couple of years now. They get better with age as the exposed copper patinas
3.0,U get what u pay for....works well for application (van to office)
3.0,Stopped using them as they do not do a good job of actually holding the ties on. They tend to slip off and end up on your wrist anyways.
3.0,"I love the look of these boots, but I had to give them away because the calf part is really narrow. These are not made for althetic body type with bigger calfs as the calf closer will not close. I read reviews stating the same, but I took a chance anyway. The shoe part itself also runs pretty small. My daughter, who’s a runner with thinner legs than her MMA fighter mom loves them. If you are not acclimated to minimalist/barefoot type shoes, these boots are not for you. They are very close to the ground with very little cushion and support. I am a fan of vibram minimalist shoes including the Furoshiki line, but for some reason, the boots fit much smaller/tighter than expected. Only a thin sock can be worn, but they are pretty warm according to my daughter. And they are aesthetically pleasing. Good luck."
3.0,Runs small and the arm holes are even smaller! Weird. Instead of returning it I gave it to a smaller family member. It is good quality and has unique style.
3.0,Not very shiny....
3.0,Would rather photo be part of shirt rather than ironed patch.  I wanted for a girl (teen who is very small) so to have to get a man's size is not the best.
3.0,"36 C Chest and normally a medium. Medium was too tight. The top ruffle hem landed right across the middle of my breast, which was awkward. The dress is cute and lined which I prefer."
3.0,This sport bra runs extremely small.  Suggest sizing up by 2  sizes.
3.0,It came folded and it is a lot different looking in person than in the picture
3.0,The material is very soft. However it is VERY heavy and too big to wear. It almost makes my shoulders sag under the weight.
3.0,They are good for pre-teens.  Nice
3.0,Beautiful crochet hat but way too big for an infant. More like for a tween. Keeping one sending the other one back.
3.0,"I bought two but I'm just going to keep one. They are not great, but also they are 20 bucks - what did I expect? I like the color, the material, the general line of the design. The issue is that while the material is soft, it does not support you. It's not tight enough in certain places and also the waist band slides down constantly. Periodically throughout the day I was pulling them up. The crotch would slide down, the waist would slide down, and they aren't particularly thick enough. They pass the squat test but not the cellulite test. So I'm gonna keep the one pair for whatever, but I was really out to find the affordable pair I could buy in every color. Still looking."
3.0,There were only about 4 rings that I could wear. So I gave smaller ones to granddaughter . She loved them!
3.0,I bought the yellow one. Definitely NOT YELLOW. More like a light-orange but still bright (it's not pastel). I was kind of sad that it wasn't going to work with my sunshine outfit idea but I'm learning to love it because it's not a bad dress and I like that it's loose and comfy.
3.0,Wish I had gotten the smaller earrings vs the larger size. Very cute though.
3.0,"Not very good quality. Mine was much too big. I ordered a medium and should've ordered a S or XS. Other than that, it's cute and looks good with jeans."
3.0,Pero demasiado grande y el material muy sencillo
3.0,The packaging was very beautiful the item looks good only thing it was broken when I received it
3.0,"It's very pretty but too long, I'm 5'1"" and it fitted below the knee"
3.0,"The picture of this dress shows just above the knees, but its a bit shorter on a plus size woman like me. Definitely will only be wearing in the summer."
3.0,"They are very comfortable, however, I returned them because they are thin and see through if you squat. They were more rights on my than leggings and I feel like I have to wear a long shirt with them."
3.0,"I ordered these for my almost 2-year-old son who is wearing a size 7 in most brands of shoes. I ordered a size 8 in these, and they were significantly too small. The quality and colors were nice, but I recommend ordering at least 2 sizes larger than standard American size you need. Otherwise, they were cute shoes. They just didn't fit."
3.0,This dress is not the length it appears to be in picture. Too short
3.0,We ordered this stick figure costume in blue and also the GlowCity gloves in blue. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014SG3KNU/ref=twister_B014SG3HN8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />The colors do not match when lit up. The stick figure costume looks like it is aqua compared to the blue of the gloves. My son paid his own money for the gloves for Halloween and now he is disappointed that they don't match and there is no time to fix this before Halloween.
3.0,"They were super cute, however we couldn't get them past my daughter's thigh. She wears a 10 in everything stop we were shocked that these wouldn't even go up all the way.  We returned them and ordered a 12, hoping they fit because they are super cute. And long! Which is what I was looking for. Too many shorts barely covering up our little girls these days, it was nice to find a long pair."
3.0,This thing is TINY. I'm 5'4 and average size and a large is more like a Childs 14-16. Would look cute on a very small adult.
3.0,Bangle were good for the price paid but  the quality was not  what I expected.<br />They were stylish and pretty.
3.0,"A little small based on size chart. Like the shirt, very nice."
3.0,"I have some pros and cons for this piece of jewelry.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />This is an unusual piece of jewelry. It's simple in its design but is something that could easily grab someone's attention since it's unusual to have a piercing that wraps around your ears like this. I can also see this working well with cartilage piercings once you get used to putting it on. I also like the simple design, since it allows the wearer to pair it with everyday clothing items or wear to work. I do love more fancy designs, but there's always something to be said for simplicity. This is also fairly sturdy, which proved to be an asset when it came to my fumbling around with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />While I like these earrings, they are pretty difficult to put on and took quite a lot of practice. This may be because I'm not all that coordinated, but I think it's also because these didn't come with any instructions for wear. There are instructions on the listing, but if I were to give these as a gift I wouldn't really want the recipient to check the listing and see how much I paid for them. It would be good to have some instructions in the packaging just in case the user is unfamiliar with this type of earring, as I was. To put these on you have to start from the back as opposed to the front (the way most earrings are set up), so it took me a lot of fumbling to be able to get used to this. It also seemed that this was a bit thicker than my earring holes. That may be because of the type of earrings I use, but I'm not certain. This also felt a little like costume jewelry but then again, it's not like this is high end silver. I don't think that most would expect this to be at this price poing.<br /><br />Most of my quibbles honestly stem around the lack of instructions with the package, to be honest."
3.0,"I like the overall design, but difficult to put on. The top where Texas is doesn’t stretch."
3.0,Very pretty but the rhinestones break off very easily. First time I put it on a few fell.
3.0,"The chain is extremely short, I will have to replace it , therefore it's not such a bargain"
3.0,Gorgeous earrings. They are even more beautiful in person than on the picture. The earrings arrived in perfect shape. the tassels were not frizzy or bent. I loved the way they looked on my ears. My only issue was that they were extremely heavy and that says a lot for me because I can wear a heavy earring with no problems but this was just too much . I must return them for that reason only. If they were more lightweight I would keep them.
3.0,"El gorro es bueno, pero la bufanda se descose facilmente"
3.0,I have one I purchased a year ago and I wanted to replace it. I don't care for this one so much. I thought I was ordering the same turns out not.
3.0,no place for filter insert which is disappointing
3.0,A Bit big. But if you put on a larger belt it works.
3.0,Helpful for just computer use.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, nice material and color but this one in this color runs small"
3.0,"I gave this three stars because the only thing wrong with the tie is it was more yellow than expected, my need is a richer &#34;gold&#34; hue. Great price, great Amazon service."
3.0,Sized a bit small
3.0,"Love the style but the watch felt very cheap. I question if it’s authentic Kate Spade. I kept it, it’s pretty but I think it’s way over priced for the quality."
3.0,Doesn’t fit comfortably. Too low and a bit large and loose. Doesn’t feel like wool despite being wool. Feels artificial. Too thick and clunky to be dress socks but too thin to use as winter socks for warmth. Don’t like the feel.
3.0,"Super cute, but not the greatest quality. They loosen up after a while and fall off your face."
3.0,nice warm sweatpants but too small
3.0,A little small but fits.
3.0,The chest area is a little too tight. I was constantly pulling so my bra didn’t show between the buttons.
3.0,Ok for purpose:)
3.0,I didn't like the fabric. It felt cheap. Like a costume. Otherwise it was cute.
3.0,"I can only wear the bikini top, as the bottoms were way too big for me. I had to tie them all the way around me, which looked ridiculous. The top is nice, but I wish they would adjust the sizing and offer swim separates for those with unique measurements."
3.0,Ordered XL. Fits more like a L.
3.0,was a little thin but overall was so cute and pretty comfy
3.0,I like the bag but the zipper broke after 60 days.
3.0,Lasted for about a month then broke. No pouch delivered.
3.0,"It is a nice bra, I ordered my regular size it fit perfectly everywhere except the cup mostly well but there is some extra space at the top. I was looking for a balconette bra for the shape of my breasts, it’s not quite a balconette. The color is pretty but style is still like a grandma bra."
3.0,Top and bottom both fit accurately. But I have full B or small size C boobs and they didn’t look right at all in this suit. The cups looked pointy and unflattering. I got a size large. It also came from chime which means returning it is not really an option so that will be a waste of $20.
3.0,"I liked the variety and ordered these for my daughter's septum. She has a smaller nose and these were still too small for her. Better for helix cartilage, in my opinion."
3.0,"These are beautiful! But as shown in the picture, the little simple ones are definitely not “14K gold plated”, “hypoallergenic”, etc.<br />I bought these a while back but didn’t take the time to write a review about it.<br />Within a month of purchasing, the 2 small-simple design ones started becoming rusted. The 2 bigger ones are still fine, but I guess that’s because I don’t wear them as often on a daily basis as the other two."
3.0,Don’t like the pockets.
3.0,"The material of this dress was great and it fit well, but the issue I had with it is that it was too short and if it shrank at all in the wash I could not wear it again so for that reason I returned. I am 5'4&#34; 120lbs."
3.0,Not that shiny silver look.. more gray hues
3.0,Smaller than expected!  but well-made.
3.0,It has not broke or faded in water
3.0,Okay a little tighter than expected.
3.0,"The material is prone to wrinkles, not good for travel..."
3.0,"Followed the sizing chart and bought a large as I thought the medium would be too tight in the bust. The material is a little lighter than I expected and so I will definitely have to wear something under it, almost as if the dress should be lined based on how thin the material is. Skeptical to see how it stands up to multiple washes; early days yet."
3.0,I received these in only black and white when I ordered color and I listened to the review and ordered a 12/14 and it fit my 8 year old perfectly so definitely size up a couple sizes
3.0,"I've been wearing for the last week or so, they are wearing in faster than I'd like but still good for house slippers."
3.0,It had a very shiny bright gold zipper which was not appealing. Also seeing that it was hand wash only made it not practical. It seemed nice otherwise and the fit was fine. We did return it though.
3.0,"My foot slid around this flip flop so I would say it runs a bit on the large side.  The mold is weird as it really does markedly curve up at the toes but at the same time your foot is continuously pitched forward as the heel cup is higher so it's an odd fit overall.  Walking around the house I kept feeling that the shoe was going to kick off off when I stepped forward. Also this has little nubs on the foot bed and while not uncomfortable, it was unexpected.  Not sure if there is the potential for them to wear down at all.<br />The toe piece and top thong part are comfortable."
3.0,Quality was great but size of white under blouse was 3x smaller than actual outfit.
3.0,Sharp looking. Made wider for a man or wide face person. Loved the accessories with it.
3.0,The pendants are pretty and of good quality but very small! Maybe I didnt read dimensions but thought they were bigger based on pics- like literally they are an inch from top to botom
3.0,do not hug the foot.  loose and could present a fall risk.  need something that hugs the foot without binding or pinching it. very disappointed
3.0,"What was your main concern about buying this product?  That they would leak.<br />What did you find as a result of buying it? They leaked.

3.0,The replacement watch band for my Invicta Subaqua Noma III Model 10118 came very quickly.  I like the fact it came with new pins and a tool so I could easily remove the gold tone clasp that originally came with the watch.  The replacement band came with a silver clasp so I changed it to the gold.  What is noticeable is the replacement band is not as thick as the original so I don't know if this will compromise the bands strength and life.  It is slightly lighter black then the original so I am debating whether to replace the side that didn't break.  I know one thing I will never buy another Invicta watch with a silicone rubber band.  My original band dry rotted into two pieces just sitting.  It is 5 years old but I have only worn the watch maybe 5 times since purchasing.  Invicta charges $55 for a replacement band.
3.0,"I originally got these to wear under dresses to provide some modesty on windy days and to have pockets when wearing dresses. They are comfortable. The fabric is nice thickness. The are longer than expected and tend to peek under my dresses, so will not be using it for that purpose unless it’s a longer dress. I wore them by themselves for one day and the fabric was pilling."
3.0,"The cups are really close together. Overall, it looks good"
3.0,"I'm not sure that they listed the sizing when I ordered these as I remember seeing one size fits all.  In either case, if you are no larger than a size 8, these panties are great.  Due to the very reasonable price, I'm just going to keep them."
3.0,"I didn't expect much at this price point (paid &#60;$13), but I was surprised at how well it fits both 22mm lug dive watches I've tried. My only real complaint is that the folding clasp buckle does not lock as it should - only one side can be made to snap in at a time. Will attempt to mill out the holes on either side of said clasp so it will hopefully get a better grip on the little spring-loaded studs that are supposed to secure it in place. Cheaply made, but will be probably be serviceable after about 15 minutes of effort with a drill press and an extremely fine drill bit."
3.0,As far as looks I love it!!!!<br />But to me it's to big I think it hangs to low<br />It should be more tighter closer to your nose and not sitting on your top lip!
3.0,My only complaint is the photo online made the background look gray but it is actually brown.
3.0,"Although I ordered a 3X, this item was so small that my daughter, who wears a size large, could wear it perfectly.  Runs very small.  The design was really cute, but the fit was all wrong."
3.0,Very nice but is made for little people
3.0,The plate is a quarter inch wide and writing is very small and easy to miss. The chain is huge next to it. This picture looks like it is easy to read but truth be told it is hard to see the writing. In an emergency it could be over looked as just fashion jewelry.
3.0,Cute but I returned this because it was too tight.  Large fit like a small.
3.0,The bag was beautiful but all
3.0,"I thought it was lined when advertised as heavyweight, live and learn."
3.0,This dress was much shorter than I anticipated
3.0,Not loose fitted like picture shown. Nice pattern and good for beach wear.
3.0,Upper arm ran a little small
3.0,I loved the color design. It just did not fit too tight
3.0,I went with the reviews that said it looks like an expensive bracelet and ordered it.  It is nice looking but still feels like cheap jewellery.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,Thin<br />Not great quality
3.0,I wish I would have know it's for the left ear only.. I bought it for my right daith so I'm a bit disappointed I don't get to wear it.
3.0,lasted for a few months...was exactly what i was looking for when i placed the order but it sucks that it ended up breaking and tarnishing...
3.0,"This didn't work for me. It just was too short and not flaattering. I think if you are very thin it would probably work better, but if you are a little bigger, it is not great (I am not that big- about 8 pounds overweight). The fabric was pretty thin and just didn't seem nice. The color was bright and pretty. So it will depend on your body type and what you are looking for."
3.0,The first strap is s bit tight. Got one size up but should have gotten two...
3.0,Looks worse in person. Hard to get on. Probably worth what u pay though.
3.0,Not big as I expected!
3.0,The face was scratched almost the day I put it on.
3.0,"I wish I had read reviews before spending $25 on these masks. It's not comfortable, air vents don't have a filter, not easy to put on/off. I'm disappointed with my purchase."
3.0,The earrings arrived promptly and they  are pretty. I can usually wear silver earrings but these have made my ears sore. I’m hoping it will stop
3.0,"Doesn’t look like the picture. It’s a true red, not dark burgundy, and has a boxier fit. Sleeves are too short & it’s thicker than expected; feels and fits more like a sweatshirt and less like a sweater (again, not like the picture). Somehow it still looks cute on, so I’ll be keeping it. Just not what I expected and not really what’s advertised."
3.0,"I loved the watch, came in a pretty box too! However....wore it ONCE and this happened. Really disappointing.  Was going to order the ""creamy white"" but not now.  I can, of coarse buy another band. In my "" spare time""  aka never.  So, I'd give it 5 stars had the band not peeled on day #1!<br />Would love if the seller could send a new band...hint hint"
3.0,It's cool I like the design but the material is a little on the cheap end.
3.0,great for pumpkin teeth but wouldn't use them to actually put in my mouth or a kid's mouth the edges are quite sharp.
3.0,Fits best on a 12 year old boy
3.0,its ok looks good
3.0,"The product is different from the description, the quality is very general, can not contain too many things in it, otherwise, it is easy to break, only suitable for kindergarten or first and second grade children."
3.0,Size range is incorrect L: sock size 10-13 (mens shoes size 8-12)<br />50 percent gap.
3.0,I had to buy another chain for it because of the broken chain. I was as little upset when I saw that it was broken. I would use caution when buying this.
3.0,"average - nothing special, but a bit snug for a &quot;L&quot; that is described as &quot;regular&quot; cut."
3.0,"I love zooming around on my electric scooter. Unfortunately, here in Seattle the weather is pretty cold these days, so this under-helmet cap seemed to be the right thing to solve my reasonably hairless noggin getting the chills.<br /><br />The problem is that this is a one-size-fits-all cap. And, as is often the case, that means one size won't always fit *you*. On this occasion, it actually works less well than the last cap I tried, - it doesn't sit low enough to cover my ears fully, and after a little scootering around it will often ride up my head a little, leaving my ears fully exposed. Boo!<br /><br />It's a reasonably warm cap (though certainly not for Midwest climes in the dead of winter), but the ear issues render it a no-go for me. Shame.<br /><br />2.5 out of 5. Not for me."
3.0,came folded in a box and never really unfolded
3.0,"For was a bit big, not a ton but just not form fitting. 112lb 5’3”, ordered xs.  Also the bungee look along back cutout makes it look less formal and more like one sized fits all sweat pant dress. Lace was nice. But gapped near the bottom due to slightly loose fit."
3.0,"I only gave three stars because they bent my freaking hat in the mail. They could have protected it a lil better, I even woulda paid for it. Great hat."
3.0,"My soccer playing 14 year old son tried these out. He liked the overall fit and feel, and said they were the right level of snugness for his men’s 9.5 foot. He said they were a little on the short side though, especially with shin guards stuck in them.<br />So they aren’t his favorite soccer socks but they are decent!"
3.0,Why do they keep bugging me to rate this stuff? Imagine if the food store did this to you for every item or can of dog food you bought!
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous. It really is. However, the sizing isn’t right. I wear a size 6 and wear a 36d and the small had gaps on the top under my air pits. Who would’ve thought I wouldn’t of been able to fill it out?? The waist was also big for me. Also, the straps are like ribbon and not stretchy at all. It was uncomfortable.  I gave it 3 stars because it is pretty."
3.0,Fits great I ordered a 5x and I'm a solid plus size 24 the only thing I can til is that it was somewhat cheaply made but it's very cute and long but only tank top for me I am 5&#34;3 as well no one wants to see me in a short short dress haha
3.0,"I got the 2 pack. One cream & one black. The black is perfect. Unfortunately the cream one is much smaller than the black one and doesn't fit properly. It's a shame, otherwise, I'd leave a 5 star review."
3.0,Great quality but I bought this to wear playing golf and there are no pockets!
3.0,Material very thin to wear as an outfit but nice to lounge around in the house.
3.0,ok to add to a collector's Warrior's set of pins.
3.0,"It's okay quality for the price. It doesn't look as nice as the pictures, and the paint colors are kind of random. Kind of a disappointment, but also understandable for the money."
3.0,The hat took over a month to arrive which was way longer than expected.<br /><br />This hat is pink. It is not red.
3.0,Top run small and also bottom runs big . Didnt fit me well
3.0,"I loved it when it first arrived. It fit great, but I could tell that keeping it on was going to be an issue. Sure enough, after wearing twice, the lock broke off randomly and it just kept coming apart despite my efforts to try and repair it. It’s a beautiful accessory, but the lock just isn’t practical."
3.0,Runs tight & small typically wear L got extra large and it’s like a girdle
3.0,"Overall I like these leggings but they have a few odd design quirks that I don't like. It's the waist. When I first put these on they felt SUPER cozy and nice, but then I noticed how loose it felt at the very top band. Then I realized that there was elastic running around the entire band meant to be pulled tight and buttoned to fit. A good idea in theory but in practice the elastic folds on itself creating a really lumpy band, and the extra elastic I pulled out has nowhere to go so it can become irritating stuck against my belly. I might just cut the elastic out and deal with the slightly loose band."
3.0,Very cute but very large. They over powered my face and I had to return.
3.0,sleeves are too tight  the rest fits good  I need to return  sad
3.0,It is very pretty and looks just as it is shown
3.0,"Fits true to size. The dress is okay? My daughter looked cute. The quality is not good and it’s  very stiff material. The bunny ears do not stay in place and fall in front of the bunny’s face, so half of the time you can’t tell what’s on the dress. The price point is too high for this quality.<br /><br />I wouldn’t buy this again or recommend it. There are options around the same price that are much better quality."
3.0,I bought these socks for my daughter to use in a cosplay.  They fit like they did in the picture.  But I was disappointed in the quality.  My daughter is petite and you could see her skin through the socks.  For the cost I expected the socks to be thicker.
3.0,"I ordered a size large and that ended up being too small for me. I love the design of the leggings, but the material is a bit too thin so I ended up wearing a jacket around my waist just to make sure everything was all covered."
3.0,Cute print but more like a shirt than a sweater. I returned it since I was looking more for a sweater. Thin material.
3.0,Fits a tighter then I like. I have marks on my arm and it hurts if u like comfortable go 1 size bigger then u normally do.
3.0,"I like the jacket. I bought it for spending around the campfire at night as we socially distance during Covid. Living in Chicago, the weather will get quite cold and we're hoping to be able to sit outside for several hours at a time.<br /><br />I've worn it twice so far. The first time it was in the 30s. I noticed my back was warm, but didn't really feel much extra warmth in the rest of the coat. Last weekend it was in the 40s and I was very comfortable.<br /><br />I wonder if it will keep me warm as we sit outside throughout the winter, as the temperature decreases."
3.0,"I would give it 5 start if only the clip could be rotatable. I would to be able to carry the pouch on the side, so that it's less noticeable."
3.0,"Very confusing to put on, but cute."
3.0,"Not bad but a bit small. Alone, the S&C would have been easily seen on the lapel mostly due to it's familiar shape and design. But like you, I was actually interested in the &#34;20 years&#34; at the bottom. Unfortunately, it's very small, and I've only had one brother notice it. He put his reading glasses on and got in close to see it. He hadn't been able to make out the print but had noticed the pin said something. Had the &#34;20 Years&#34; been a bit larger, or even replaced with a large &#34;20&#34;, it would be a major improvement."
3.0,It's  to wear with a costume for comic con.
3.0,"It is a nice and fuzzy warm material, but completely see through. wearing under garments or not, everything is seen. I'm returning it"
3.0,They don't hug my face as well as I wanted.
3.0,Like how product is supposed to work but very tight pulling it over the hips. Fits good in the waist. Too long for vertically challenged people like me. Comes down to my knees so I’m going to have to shorten the length.
3.0,Quality not as expected. After a single wash socks looks worn out
3.0,"They pajamas fir well, but they are so thin and you can see through them. I assumed for the price, they would be made from decent material. They are still cute though."
3.0,Was not as expected unable to really see thru it..
3.0,"The swimsuit itself is decent quality, especially for the price. A star down for the absolutely terrible boob support. It has these cheap, circular cup padding things that make your boobs look slightly bizarre. Plus, I'm only a C and these things are not really holding stuff up. It's too small. I'm trying things to fix it currently. Maybe if you're like an A it would work better? I don't know. Probably not. It also isn't really cut in a flattering way. If you have ANY trace of a muffin top, this thing will make it look worse than it is. The beginning of the skirt stitching pulls in just under your tummy and around, just under where love handles tend to form. Another star down because it was not as described. I ordered the blue one, but I have a black one with bright electric blue polka dots."
3.0,I love the color and the thickness but the crotch fits really weird. There is no true front and back which is probably part of the problem and they keep getting twisted around and I have to constantly readjust them.
3.0,"This skirt is cute, but it's a little shorter than I was expecting - giving it more of a trendy tutu look than a more classy lacy look. The lace is pretty, but I wouldn't buy this skirt again, because I prefer a classic look to a cheaper modern look."
3.0,These look great and are lightweight but after using them for a few hours they loose their shape and start falling off. They don't stay on your face.
3.0,"This is a nice shirt, however the problem is that the buttons and tabs are placed too low on the sleeve (below the elbow instead of nearer to the biceps. The tabs hang out of the sleeve when the sleeves are not rolled up. You cannot use the tabs to roll up the sleeves because you can only turn up the cuffs once or the tabs hang way below the upturned sleeve. I am going to try to remove the buttons and tabs from the shirt and hope it does not tear up the fabric. The fabric is a gauze like material and is very sheer, so one needs to wear it as an overshirt.  All that said, I still like the shirt itself but the manufacturer needs to remedy the design flaw."
3.0,"I got the correct size, but the leg portion of the underoos is too short. so they bunch up, go for a size or so bigger if you've got cake. youll need it.  great deal for the price. made well."
3.0,"It is larger than I realized when I ordered, making it pretty heavy BEFORE keys..."
3.0,Used this for a Halloween costume. It served it's purpose. You can tell it's cheaply made and flimsy.. Probably need to iron out the creases from shipping but I decorated the whole thing so none of this was a problem for me. Shipping took nearly 30 days.
3.0,Sizes are all messed up too small didn't return because of hassle watch for sizing problems
3.0,I took other reviews to heart and was sure to order a larger size than normal. I am normally a XL but in fitted clothing I have issues in the bust area. According to other reviews the shirt always runs small so I ordered a 3X (two sizes up) just to be safe. It was a good thing I did because even at two sizes larger than normal it is still a bit more snug than I like. Especially in the bust and arms. If it had been any smaller I would have to return it.  The fabric does has a nice feel and even when stretched it stay pretty opaque. They look decently on but I will not order them again as they are just to snug even with ordering two sizes larger than normal size.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this one, pink color is adorable, material is soft and very cozy, comforting BUT - top part is baggy and wide open on the bottom so cold air gets to ""sneak up"", it would be much better if it laid snug around waste. Pants are a bit too short (and I am short myself) and also too wide.  Had to return it."
3.0,"Great price, great fit (it IS Charter Club after all!) and so toasty warm.<br />UPDATE: after wearing 2x these slippers stretch out so much they do not stay on one's feet. NOT RECOMMENDED"
3.0,The color in the full body picture is the correct one. It is a very bubblegum pink. I wanted to give this sweater a chance based on the photos in other lighting but it was NOT a dusty pink and I don't even know how they got it to look like that without filters. The sweater seemed to be of good quality but unless you're looking for a bright pink it won't be one you keep.
3.0,"Nice shirt, fits my build. 5’7 165lbs, ordered med. If you are athletic and hit the gym often  you won’t be disappointed. Handled well in the wash but.. I recommend hanging to dry due to shirts getting  beat up in the dryer after the third or fourth wash. Great shirt for the $"
3.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and a size 16 (XL in tops typically, 16 jeans) 38C chest, and this fit me in a size XL. It came right down to the bottom of my knees. Overall this is an ok dress. I wouldn't spend more than about $20 tops on it though. I tried it on when I first got it and then washed it on cold in a mesh bag and hung it to dry to make sure it wouldn't shrink and then tried it on again and it was fine. There are a bunch of loose threads on it, I feel like the buttonholes could really use another round of stitching to make them feel sturdier but they're fine. The fabric hangs well and has some nice drape to it and it came out with just a few wrinkles when air drying. I would just need to toss it in the dryer for a few minutes to fix that.<br /><br />I will say that if you have a larger than average chest, this probably won't fit you. The buttons on mine are strained, just toeing the line between being tight and starting to gap. I can get away with it but can easily see how the top would be an issue for anyone larger, and my chest isn't even that large for my frame at all, I feel like I'm on the smaller side actually. For the price I paid, I feel like its worth keeping though."
3.0,Shoes are very conformable however the first day I wore them in the rain the lights short circuited. If you purchase these only wear them in dry weather.
3.0,Rode up.
3.0,"Definitely smaller than pictured , but it's cute if you like very dainty jewelry . Very cute cause it's so tiny"
3.0,I was able to take the sides in so I can wear it comfortably around the house or over my bathing suit.
3.0,"Not made with cashmere - label says 67.2% sheep wool (0% cashmere).<br />However, the fit and utility are perfect, so I'm tempted to keep. The fine knit makes them easy to wear while using mobile or laptop. Fit is perfect on s/m womens hands. I like how they cover a third of my finger length, and having the thumbs free makes them easier to keep on while you type or text."
3.0,Nice rich color and decent thickness. The material lays well but doesn't heal so well from tie tacks. I would avoid using a tie tack too often. Construction could be a little better. It will loose shape if you pull on it too hard when straightening your knot.
3.0,"The necklace is pretty, but it looks cheaply made. I purchased it as a gift but after it arrived I felt it wasn’t good enough so I kept it. I’ve bought better quality items from the local dollar store. I don’t expect this will last long."
3.0,Thought they would be thicker
3.0,To small through the chest gave it to my daughter..
3.0,Looked  great and felt amazing install was easy. But quality leaves much to be desired. Pin broke in clasp after a few uses. Really sucks because I loved the way it looked.
3.0,"I typically order a large or size 8/10. I originally had a large selected, but the info says a a medium is 8/10 and I have a dress that looks the same (bought somewhere else) and it was loose fitting so I went with the medium. It’s so cute but I wish I would have got the large because it’s too tight and doesn’t look good. It’s definitely fitted throughout the middle section and NOT loose like I thought. Buy a size up if you have any curves. I’m 5’6” with an average body size. It is great in length (above ankles)."
3.0,Could have made this with my inkjet printer and iron on.
3.0,It is super cute but runs way too small. Bought a size 6 for my daughter who wears a 5 thinking it would be perfect but no. When it arrived looked more like a size 4. Way too small so I had to give it to my niece. Runs really small. I would get two sizes up then normal size they wear.
3.0,"Had a weird smell when I opened it, once I aired it out it went away. Haven’t washed it yet but seems good so far"
3.0,The chest part looks weird on me. Everything else is fine.
3.0,"The small band broke with in first few wears. Otherwise, nice watch."
3.0,It's costume jewelry and looks it up close.  After a while it starts to bubble and flake.
3.0,"Straps kept coming lose, not very secure"
3.0,I received it in a timely manner. It was not as bright a blue as pictured. It was a little bit lighter than the picture.
3.0,"I wear a XL in shirts and dress shirts, this style shirt is very form fitting and not made for guys with a little bigger belly.<br />Really thin material, and is short in length. accepted my return same day so that was great customer service."
3.0,Cute earrings absolutely not for sensitive skin
3.0,The sock material is very thin.....wore a hole in one sock after wearing it twice......proves the old adage.....&#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
3.0,Comfy and cute. Definitely a lot shorter than the picture. It stops mid thigh. Purchased a large
3.0,The size runs small.
3.0,"I purchased in two colors. Black and burgundy. They fit the same. Great length. Slightly snug throughout except for some reason the waist sticks out in the back. I purchased a small. I normally wear 3-5 in Juniors or 0/2 in Women’s (0P, 2P)"
3.0,Very thin and I would rather have a thicker stone I ended up giving them away<br />they were small posts as well did not fit
3.0,"As others have stated, it's really big. Purchased this for my wife and it was really big. Even for me as a dude this was quite big. I have a  small but still in the &#34;normal&#34; range size head (22 inch circumference). And this thing was still really big. It's okay if you are big or plan to use it as a base for modifications. If you are not crafty, stay away from it."
3.0,"It's cute, I suppose.. but it fits very awkwardly...  Not sure what to think of this .."
3.0,As expected fir the $
3.0,Good comfortable slipper but the thread at the heal has come apart. It didn’t last very long
3.0,"As many others have said, these run small. They fit on my feet, are just a bit tight, especially the printed ones. I wear 8 1/2 women's."
3.0,Lovely piece but the chain was too thin for it and it snapped fairly quickly.
3.0,also was made from a weird smelly material
3.0,It's really cute but a little to small to use for shopping in my opinion. I decided to use it to put my trash in for my car.
3.0,Gave as a gift and she liked it. But I was pretty surprised at how small and delicate it was when it arrived. It would be better if the photos (especially of jewelry) would include a size comparison.
3.0,"This is a comfortable dress.  Very long.  Drawstring neckline, which I do not  like and which was not really visible in the picture.  The material is a soft knit jersey, and will wrinkle, but a minute in the dryer fixes that fine.  It was very long, so I had to hem it.  I actually took the entire lower tier off.  As the entire waist area between the under bust and top of hip is ruched (gathered with elastic threads) it is not something that you can wear a belt with.  I could not see that in the picture, either.<br /><br />I say, buy it, and if you don't like it send it back.  It's okay.  But the 3 stars is the poor picture's fault, as I was a bit disappointed, just not enough to send it back."
3.0,"Work ok. I can definitely see the line of the bifocals...I have other bifocals where that line is not noticeable. They are very small. Smaller than most others of this shape. But, the lens is clear and they work if you arent picky."
3.0,"This dress is great quality. It is very comfortable, but you need to find something that doesn't show your underwear. The material isn't thin, its just white. Just like white jeans, you'd have to be selective on what you put underneath."
3.0,"Colors and material nice,just too boxy fitting."
3.0,The waist was fine but the skirt had way too much fabric. It was a stiff cotton so it was not flowing it was more like a supper starchy shirt. If there was less fabric maybe it was lay nicer ?
3.0,The slippers seemed perfectly fine themselves. The slipper said size 9-10 but they fit more like a 7-8. Having to return them.
3.0,Looks like their quality control has gone down a bit but overall its a great glove. Touchscreen and sizing could be definitely better though. However warmth is there.
3.0,"It’s a really cute dress but sheer..need a slip underneath, which is no biggie!"
3.0,"It's a pretty pin, but smaller than expected."
3.0,"These socks are fairly attractive and very cushioned and comfy to stand in.  Unfortunately, while the toe box is very roomy (possibly even overly large?) the ankles are way too small for my cankles. I couldnt wear them for more than a few minutes.  Given that the XL is supposed to fit a men's 9 I believe sizing is off.<br /><br />too bad"
3.0,Sent as gift no complaints
3.0,"These slippers are high quality as the price would indicate. I think they would last a long time and they're fairly comfortable -- as long as you're sitting down or standing still. Walking in them is another matter. The soles grip the floor and have no heel so they easily slip off your feet. That makes them somewhat dangerous. I tried to get used to them, but I didn't feel secure while wearing them, unless I was sitting. Quite often one of them slipped off my foot and tripped me. I feel lucky I never to hit the floor, but sometimes I had to grab a table or chair to keep myself upright. I've bought other slippers now and these will just gather dust. I can't recommend them, especially for anyone older, where a fall could be disastrous."
3.0,shorts run small. Long wait to receive them over a month.
3.0,Super cute but the sizing was off. I had to send it back.
3.0,Would  have loved for this dress to be more fitted below the waist.
3.0,Skirt is a little longer than stated in the description. I keep having to pull it up but you can still totally make it work for the price. I’m tall and curvy so finding skirts are hard. It’s really comfortable and doesn’t hug the tummy too much. I’m happy with it.
3.0,"This is not a quality flannel, very light material. After 1rst wash it did shrink, as expected.That's why I ordered 1 size up. Will not be ordering another from this vendor"
3.0,The earrings are gorgeous but the backs don't stay for any of them which forces me to order a set of backs.
3.0,Very light but a bit tight. Lens are feel fragile.
3.0,Cute shirt and fit if you’re not planning to sweat or be too active. Snags and shows sweat.
3.0,"Quality was very good, well made but size was small so won’t be able to wear more than a couple of times( growing child). This is for the top the bottom was way too small. It was ordered basically for the top; but would not be able to use a swimming rash guard ."
3.0,Color good
3.0,about one week this watch get loss colors
3.0,"Weird material, it's slippery and thin. It's cute, but I don't like the material."
3.0,I like it but it's a little too big
3.0,i think thiswas a great wallet but was alittle wider than i like  lots of card space
3.0,Lettering is already wearing off after a month. :(
3.0,It’s a little on the sheer side and the fabric isn’t very soft. The cut is adorable though so if you want to wear a cami underneath it would probably work out well. I’m not a fan of layers so I’m sending it back.
3.0,"I bought this for my mentally retarded, legally blind brother. He pushed his sleeves up to put his hands in the sink and the watch band broke. I emailed customer service probably a month ago regarding a new band but have not had a response."
3.0,Green tint is very disorienting
3.0,It appears to be more fitted in the picture. It is staples like a man’s tshirt. Disappointed for sure as I was hoping to wear soon.
3.0,In lining on the top keeps falling down. Had to wear a camisole under the dress.
3.0,First the plastic holder broke in 2 days. Then the metal holder broke after 2 weeks.
3.0,Falls apart very fast.
3.0,"I love the color and love the look. I also do not mind that it is thin. I feel this could be used by both a man or a woman. I actually ordered this for me.<br /><br />However, this scarf is a bit itchy to me; therefore, I will have to make sure I wear a turtleneck when using this or put it outside my jacket. There is no tag on it but the Amazon site says it is made of 100% acrylic. As you can see from the photo, the edges are also kind of &#34;ratty.&#34; There is currently no price posted, but in its current condition, I would not pay more than $12 for this scarf.<br /><br />I usually wash scarves like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry them."
3.0,the tie in back helps with adjusting the top to fit.it was comfortable not too low cut.the shorts however are not what I would call boy shorts .they were shorter then pictured by another customer and I felt a little uncomfortable with that but did fit like panties so if that is ok with you  then it was fine .I decided to buy a different bottom.was complimented when I wore it
3.0,wanted real pocket not a fake one
3.0,I expected them to be a little less subtle but they are quite large. I probably won't be wearing them to work any time soon.
3.0,"Not bad, but somewhat small"
3.0,Adorable and well made but way too small!!! My son is in the 10th percentile and it was still too small for his little head. Had to return it.
3.0,Very pretty fit just fine. But I just did not like how the front is when it hangs. Will be returning
3.0,Not worth buying. I can insert my cups with my hands/fingers much easier.
3.0,Actually used the apron to wear while cooking. Looked great until I washed it. The front was not cut on a bias and bunched up after washing.
3.0,This shirt it not thin or sheer. Beautiful color and design. Perfect true to size fit. My ONLY complaint is it to polyester for a T-shirt. It is definitely not T-Shirt material.
3.0,It's too short to be a dress but still cute as a tunic with leggings.
3.0,"The dye on this garment is terrible. When I touch it my hand turned blue. All I did was try it on and my legs had a blue tint. I soaked it in 2gallons water and 1 cup vinegar solution. Then rinsed and washed it. So far it seems to have set the dye. I thought I was purchasing a denim skirt. It is a rayon skirt- denim color. This means it is a thin material, not as durable as denim. The skirt is a perfect length. The trim is beautiful and it swings with a sufficient amount of material. However, the trim looks easy to fray. I will probably have to wash on a delicate cycle or hand wash to keep the trim from pulling out. I feel the price is high considering what you get. I decided to keep it because of the way it fit, and how pretty it looks. Just make sure you understand what you are ordering."
3.0,Belt lasted about 2 years before completely breaking in multiple spots.  That's what happens when you use plastic/pleather instead of the real deal.  Would gladly have paid 40-50 bucks for a real leather version of this same belt.
3.0,Very difficult to gage the sizing. I wear an xxl and this was closer to a large or xl. Price is good just sizing is way off. Had to return.
3.0,These look good but are pretty cheap.  They are good for a little kid who needs something but nothing fancy.
3.0,"I've bought baleafs high-waisted yoga pants for years.  I own at least 8 pair, some long, some capri. I have always loved them but this style with pockets ride down. I'm constantly pulling them up. So they don't fit as high waisted as my others.  They feel like a med. Im 5'5 and 143lbs at 59 yrs of age.  I look more like a med but I have always bought large in my yoga pants. These don't feel like like a large"
3.0,Need to send back too small went Wil the statement of other conumers to get the size of the bra you wear but way to small for myself or my friend I got it for .
3.0,I wasn’t impressed with withe the material in this dress. Thought it would not hold up so I returned.
3.0,This tank top was a lot smaller than I expected for a medium and it is see-through...
3.0,Wish the just wasn’t so tight! I’m 5’7” 140 lbs. Bust 36B and the bust was SUPER tight in the medium. Most dresses and tops I order are size small and some medium. This size Medium was always too small-only in the bust.
3.0,They were to big and the wrong size
3.0,I'm a size 18 plus but it fits more like a size 16. I'm keeping it cause when I loose a couple inches it'll be perfect.
3.0,"The socks fit good, but are just little too short. The over all fit is fine, with the exception of the height of the sock.<br />I'll still keep them and wear them."
3.0,Disregard size comments and order the size you usually order.  After reading these reviews I ordered a size smaller for my<br />husband and now have to waste time and money to return them.  Also the shirts are not fleece just regular sweat shirt material.
3.0,The denim is not as thick as expected
3.0,"Fits well, adjustable, snowflakes look a little better on-line.  My main complaint is that it has white stitching.  The on-line picture doesn’t show this.  The white stitching doesn’t look very nice."
3.0,Must get fitted correctly for great fit.
3.0,"not sure it was made for a mans wrist, its very small."
3.0,"Dress is hard to walk in, had to open it up at the seam to make a kick pleat"
3.0,"Shipping was quick but it was much too large for my wrist, even in the last loop."
3.0,"I like them very much, but they are very heavy."
3.0,I loved the design but this runs extremely small.
3.0,I purchased this belt around 45 days ago and it is showing signs of wear earlier than i would expect.  I contacted the seller and they offered to send a new belt for free. They also said there have been manufacturing improvements made to improve the belt.
3.0,"I wore one of them for a day and a little bit of the chain broke. Also, they all seem to be different sizes, but i really like them for the price."
3.0,Chain only lasted for 48 hours before it turned black. Pendant looks great and has not lost its luster
3.0,I ordered a size 10/12 for my daughter and it barely fit. The bottom if the shirt just met the bottom of her torso. I would recommend buying a size up. The material of the shirt is quite soft.
3.0,Great looking but one of the earrings stripped out one day and I can no longer wear them
3.0,The Print is not the best
3.0,Fits better on a woman
3.0,I loe how it lools however its not made of material that will last long. I have a crack already
3.0,"I like that it arrived on time. However I received it damaged. Has a deep C-shaped cut in the steel. Quality control should've caught this & it never should've been shipped. Kinda upset cuz others than that, I really like the ring."
3.0,"The dress was nice; however one my 5'8"" 190 lb frame it just did not look as nice as it would have if I were thinner. The return was super fast and easy.  Perhaps, if and when I lose weight I can buy one in a much smaller size and look better in it?"
3.0,"I really loved this ring. But the stone was loose when I received it. Was not too worried about it because I have jewelry glue. However, the stone fell out and now I cannot wear the ring. Very disappointed because it was a gorgeous ring."
3.0,"Returned this item.  This was the first Asian sizing item that I finally decided to buy up a size, and it fit like I would expect the size to fit, not smaller like all the other Asian sizing clothes, so it was bigger then I wanted.  Contemplated buying the size down then but decided against bc of the strong chemical smell it had.  I had to leave it outside once it was open until I packed it back up.<br /><br />Looks wise though I thought it was nice and it seemed like it would be decent in the cold days."
3.0,"In the picture these flights look a very vibrant pink.  They are not.  They aren't bad, don't get me wrong.  They are pretty enough.  Just not the bright pretty color I was expecting.  Not sure I would have ordered if I had realized how muted they would be."
3.0,not what i hoped but itll do
3.0,"This should've been cheaper and the quality of the arms can be flimsy.  However, they are also larger frames so if that's not what you're looking for, I would suggest a different pair."
3.0,"At $16.99, this was a decent pair of slippers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Warm<br />- Sole seems durable<br />- Clean, simple design<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Label where your heel is can be a little scratchy (but only a little; after you've had it on for awhile you'll probably not feel it anymore)<br />- Smaller than expected (I usually wear size 9.5; ordered the 'Large' for this product, which is ostensibly for sizes 10-11, and it fits very snugly; if I were a size 10 I think the back of my heel would be sticking out of the slippers)<br />- I'm not sure it has the &#34;memory foam feel&#34; advertised"
3.0,I really like this shirt but it buttons from the other side<br />In other words it buttons like a woman’s shirt<br />Being a man it is a bit hard to get used to<br />The shirt itself is nice and light and is hard to wrinkle<br />Like it
3.0,"I was so hopeful -- a 34G bra for under $30! And the fit of the bra is spot on, with a shape like Polish bras with narrower, more projected cups which is great for a smaller frame. I would have given it five stars except for the one major problem, which is the strap on the right side was sewn with a twist. I had to rip out the stitches, re-thread the strap in the slider, and re-sew the strap, which took more than an hour to repair. I will probably buy again just because the price was so good."
3.0,This product burns my eyes. I tried to use it twice and just couldn't tolerate it. Then I got a stye on my eyelid. It comes on a beautiful case though.
3.0,"I ordered a XL since I am 5’9” and weigh 179.  Ran very small, couldn’t get them over my thighs!  Sent them back for a refund.  They were very tight around the legs.  Quality was fine, just runs small."
3.0,The sizes are way off. I bou6a 3X and it was still too small. Normally I'm a 1X. Luckily I was able to give it away as a gift and she liked it
3.0,It's beautiful but the lace that hold the fur is weak it's easy to pop loose
3.0,"This is really pretty, a little bigger than i thought. Shipping literally took forever almost 2 months."
3.0,"There’s are cute socks .. BUT they definitely will not fit a grown mans foot. I bought them for my child with the expectation that they would be a little big , no big deal ( huge Dipper fan) they barely fit my 7 year old.  They are really tight like a compression sock."
3.0,"I’m Normally a L or XL depends on Brand..<br /><br />For some Season Small Fit me Perfect b/c they are Super Stretchy & Yes with Curves..<br /><br />It had a HOLE in the Left Pocket which was Strange, I was not happy about at all. It got on my nerves, until I sewed the Darn Pocket up. 🙁🤬<br /><br />*3 Stars b/c of the Hole but the Texture & the Fit is not accurate at all. So down size if you can 1-2 sizes."
3.0,Not enough room for bust.
3.0,Not as comfortable as i hoped.
3.0,"Works well; however, it is made for guys with no butts!  Those of us that have a Jug or Bubble butt need extra material or it's a Mini skirt!"
3.0,The size of they diamond was perfect not to big not no small but the bar part was thicker then the ones I usually use  to me the thickness of them seemed more like the nose rings they give you when you first get your nose pierced then the ones that you use regularly after having the nose pierced for awhile being able to change your jewelry for the first time.  The amount of them you get for the price is great but I just didn't like how thick they were.  Again when it comes to body piercings and body jewelry different people have different preferences so based on the size of the diamond  and they look good quality I would definitely recommend them to anybody who likes a thicker bar
3.0,"I really was happy with it until the magnet came out... I found another one and gorilla glued it, so it works great now...."
3.0,The only bad thing is it came torn on one side of the dress. Not good. Not happy about that.
3.0,Not bad for the money but look very cheap
3.0,Disappointed in the sheerness and the quality. And the sleeves are way too long
3.0,The buckle is too tight for the band to slide thru when adjusting size. Especially when damp. Plus there is a seam in there that keeps getting stuck in the buckle. It just gets bungled up and I have to pull it out with my teeth it’s so tight.
3.0,Bracelet was too small
3.0,Made very thin. Have to wear another pair of socks underneath them.
3.0,"I needed white pants for a class - thought these would be simple and seemed easy to care for. Pants are NOT white, but beige. Comfortable, high waist. Washed well but overall not what I expected, as they are described as WHITE."
3.0,"The material and fit are nice, but I am disappointed that the stripes are printed and not woven as it appears."
3.0,"This might not be a fair review because I am a super super picky shopper. This dress was really cheap so I figured I'd give online shopping a try. The pattern just is not flattering on me. The dress is OK, but it's loose in the chest area and sags a little bit. I am more of a buttoned up look kind of a person. I guess my test to shop online without trying on first was a fail and I will stick to in store shopping and buying online after I try it on."
3.0,They were good just thought they were bigger
3.0,Didn't fit Certainly not true to size.
3.0,This was super cute in person but runs small.  I am 5'6 and 195 with 38G chest.  This was too tight on the chest and made the seam too high so it looked funny.  Did not look right.  It would be good for someone with a smaller chest
3.0,We ordered the size my daughter wears but the hoodie is too small.
3.0,"It’s what you expect for the price, but note that the colors are black, tan, and light beige — not exactly as depicted."
3.0,"I am sure they will be fine, slightly inadequate mounting system, but I am desperate for some protection from the sun, and don't want to spend big bucks for prescription SGs."
3.0,I like the backside of these shorts the scrunchie look
3.0,few lights in pack were not working
3.0,The grey is really a light lavender color almost purplish. Guys beware. Nice hat otherwise.
3.0,They're nice but little too tight
3.0,Very good price with the special and discount. But not indestructible. Few months after I bought it the lenses started to peel off at the edges.
3.0,Tightens around the knee. Uncomfortable.
3.0,The soft tunnels are great but the solid ones aren’t too good but worth it
3.0,Held up well for about a month.  My daughter’s toes were wearing through at this time.  Not bad for what you pay and if you need something on a budget in a pinch.
3.0,I bought this for my husband but had to return it because it was VERY PINK!  Not like the color in the picture.
3.0,This skirt is beautiful I love it the material is very nice and light. I normally wear a large in skirts I ordered a large it fit bit it was extremely way to long so unfortunately I returned it. I am going to reorder a medium to see if the length will work.
3.0,"sizing is much smaller than I expected, luckily I can wear unbuttoned with an undershirt"
3.0,"It is really pretty and nice and light weight but, the sleeves weren't sewn on right or something.  The one I got in black was perfect.  My fault I should have returned it."
3.0,"Not durable, will not keep its shape if place in the drier.."
3.0,"On the positive side, the dress is cute and fits well/as expected. I prefer this as a bathing suit cover up rather than a dress to be worn casually out in spring summer, since the quality is lesser than expected. Has a cheapy sort of feel to it. But, it is cute and from a distance the cheapy-ness material is less noticeable."
3.0,"I purchased this for my daith piercing.<br /><br />Small overall dimensions.  Looks dinky in my ear,  and I have relatively small  ears.<br />  Clicker was accurate and snapped together and held the first time without adjustments.  Which is a  very good plus for fitment and quality."
3.0,This strap is good but not original. It is made from harder material. The description of the product says original Casio strap that's why I spent extra bucks to buy this one.
3.0,"I liked design a lot and it also fits pretty well, but I've returned it because the material felt too synthetic. I prefer something more natural and comfortable for beach cloth."
3.0,"The other review said tight waist band and loose legs.mine were just the opposite. The waist band is a little loose and legs a little tight. I am 5'10&#34;, usually size 10 or 12. I got the large. They are a little sheer but I will be wearing as a base layer so I don't mind. Outer layer will keep the top in place and I think the legs will stretch a bit with wearing. I only paid $15 so I will keep and see how they work. They are a little shorter than I would wish as well, but my wool hiking socks will cover. They come to about 3 inches above my ankle. Compared to the price of others for a light under layer it is a good deal. I will update after a wear and wash."
3.0,Way smaller than I needed
3.0,does not look like the picture. its a cheap thin dress and Its not black and white and like a washed black so it looks blue and white
3.0,"These fit fine but the plastic is so hard, they are very uncomfortable for my daughter"
3.0,"Pretty print but not a true size 3x. I ordered some from Wendy Williams brand in a size 2/3 x ,, and they fit great."
3.0,"these are very nice slippers, but are way too small, ordered a size 6 couldn't even get my foot inside. Had to send them back."
3.0,Although these are the only comfortable shoes I have been able to find in recent years they have a very annoying flaw that quickly reduced the design from a five star to a three star rating.  The design flaw is a loud popping speak that the tread design produces after several months of wear.  I believe this is due to pockets of air being trapped in the long concave pockets in the tread just under the ball of the foot.  Nike could very easily fix this design flaw by returning to the tread pattern of the Air Monarch II or III.  I have wore both the Monarch II and III and do not recall having any problems whatsoever.
3.0,"The pants were VERY long for my 34” child. The shirt and shorts were fine, but we cannot use the pants. Soft silky material."
3.0,I loved it because it's Friday the 13th inspired... but the Keychain is cheap and broke easily.
3.0,"They fit over my prescription glasses just fine but it would be great if the shades were darker, so you couldn't see my glasses through them."
3.0,"Cute bag for the price. Looks a little cheap since it's so shiny. The handle straps are beginning to crack after 2 months' continuous use; I fill my bags with a lot of stuff, so I'll probably invest in a better quality and larger bag."
3.0,"serves the purpose, but  not quite dark enough  I like the ones &#34;as seen on TV&#34; better"
3.0,is very nice and warm and also very cute but............. i hate that the ears are glued and i can feel the dry hard glue and is very uncomfortable and it runs small
3.0,it's really  big and flowing on your advertizment. It doesn't fit that way. I love the colors.
3.0,Bought for my niece. They are super cute but way too big. Had to return
3.0,"This is pretty and a nice thick fabric, but it runs small. I found it to be small across the arms/back because it pulled on my arms and didn’t hang right. I would size up."
3.0,"I love the dress. I bought it in two colors in case I didn’t like one but really liked both. The materials looks almost like silk and is well cut.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is only a two inch difference between the waist and the bossom, even in an XL so the largest cup size that the dress will accommodate is a B. There is no stretch to the material so there was the dreaded “bread loaf” effect. I would recommend this dress if you have a more conservative busy size."
3.0,as shown in pic. deluvery time takes too long
3.0,Nice fabric that feels soft but I needed to size up.
3.0,Great concept. Clear glass area is not good glass though. I'd gladly have paid a bit more for better optics. Tight at the temples and I have a really small face.
3.0,"The inside cloth of the shoe bothers the feet, not as warm as i was expecting it. Not a high quality product."
3.0,These are so cute and have the perfect saying for my MIL!  I do wish they were more of a snugly sock than just a basic dress-sock type material since they are for lounging around the house.
3.0,Bought for a baby shower. Ok but no snaps on the pants and makes it hard for new moms to do multiple changes in a day...
3.0,"This bra fit a little tighter for a 40D, which is good for support. I did not like the back close system on this bra and felt it did not have the support I liked in the racer back style, so I am returning it. Still drastically better than 80% of sports bras out there, but in 40D, I am looking for ultimate support."
3.0,"I sized according to the shoe sizing listed on the product page, and it seems a bit larger than it should be on my foot, but it stays on nicely due to the ribbing style. It feels like a good material. I think $9 a sock is too high for just one pair. I hope they bring the price down."
3.0,Didn't fit well. It was too large at the bust line and the fabric looked cheap and the stitching wasn't done well. I would not recommend this dress.
3.0,"Sizing was small, didn't look quite as nice as I had hoped"
3.0,I like it but it is temporary as expected by the price. It currently smells like old steel
3.0,Something my nephew simply had to have. I felt it was somewhat thin and cheap looking.
3.0,The left over band is always just hanging and the loop to hold it down never stays put. Do not buy this if your OCD or work in a warehouse setting
3.0,"I like the glasses as they softly grip your head.  Don't have to worry about perspiring and having them fall off as you bend down, or swing at a golf ball.  They have one terrible weakness, the connections between the nose piece and ear pieces to the lenses. These connection points break down and have to be sent to the shop for repair. I wish these were more sturdy given their titanium structure, but they are not."
3.0,Very crappy made product. I love their design even if the quality is not proper.
3.0,I bought these for a party but unfortunately they wouldn't stay on. Would be cute for like photos maybe but they don't hold up.
3.0,Doesn't stretch
3.0,The jean material feels cheap..
3.0,"I sent this back because it was much longer on me than the look I was going for. Since I'm short, it was just too much. The waist was way too big, very unflattering too."
3.0,It was comfortable but not a favorite style
3.0,"It didn't fit as expected. However, good product"
3.0,The top is pretty cute but the fabric was not breathable and the arms are cut very wide in comparison to the overall size. I returned it.
3.0,The purple cake a lot darker than in the picture. The pink was a little bit darker but black was pretty much as expected. The inside is soft which is nice although the chokers do feel a bit awkward when on. Not bad for how cheap it is but I’m upset about the purple not being pastel.
3.0,The print on the shirt looks just like the picture . I would of given this a 5 star if the sizes would of been correct. Thank god I read the reviews I normally wear a 1x and Ordered a 4 x fits great runs small tho pls order up on sizes
3.0,"Unfortunately, I had to return this. I'm 5'4"", about 145 lbs and wear a 34DD and I ordered a large.  The length was great and the dress fit well- nice and loose- except for under my arms. There was just too much extra fabric there."
3.0,Runs large and the antiquing is a little dusty. The stone is light pink to grey depending on the lighting. I would have kept it except for the size
3.0,The picture shows capris coming up to waistline. They do not come up to waistline and were very uncomfortable. But worse than that was the fact that I had to pay shipping to return them. Will not buy from this company again.
3.0,"Pretty in person and good for. Quality is pretty cheap, but good enough for pictures and one wear. I can’t imagine it lasting more than that as the fabric was already snagging."
3.0,Good fitting and clmfy
3.0,"Look, it does the job, but if there is a less flattering, more matronly dress out there, I've never seen it.  I can feel myself aging a decade each time I put it on."
3.0,"Good material, cute too but they do run small"
3.0,the lace and fabric felt heavier and thicker than I like
3.0,"They were way smaller then I thought, but I don’t know shoelace length. Oh well, overall nice material though."
3.0,Stiff sticks out in the back
3.0,"It's cute, but it had an extra, sharp piece of metal at the top. I was able to nip it off with wire clippers. Quality isn't great but it's a fair piece of costume jewelry."
3.0,"I bought two pairs, one for each of my sons and one of the pair of goggles almost immediately broke in the Middle where it sits on the nose, the other pair  seems to be holding up fine"
3.0,"It was half the size I thought it would be. Because the picture is a close up, I did not realize it was much smaller than it seemed on the screen. The dimensions are listed in the ad, I just failed to notice them."
3.0,It fits great however it has a strange coating and when washed it the color fades a lot.
3.0,"I got these for a Renn Faire outfit. I read the reviews saying they ran big, however they didn’t for me? I know my size and I ordered my size thinking they would either fit perfect or be a little big. They won’t zip up, the thighs are so small I can barely pull them up, and would show my butt crack if I were able to get them on all the way."
3.0,"Bought these goggles for my 12yr old son. After a couple of days at the pool, they are no longer leakproof or anti-fog. He constantly has to take them off and on to clear up."
3.0,The material is not of good quality. It’s already making little balls after only one wear and wash.
3.0,Super cute but I find myself having to pull it up often because it is quite long.
3.0,"I ordered two sweaters since I saw the divided reviews. I'm almost 5'6, generally a medium in tops and bottoms, and a 34D.<br /><br />Yellow sweater (SIZE MEDIUM): chenille material, short, wide, bulky, uncomfortably stiff turtleneck. shipping took forever.<br />1/5 stars only because it’s so soft<br /><br />White sweater (SIZE SMALL): soft wool material, long arms and length, relaxed turtleneck. very fast shipping.<br />4/5 stars because I love everything but the really big armpit area.<br /><br />I kept the white sweater and returned the yellow. The sizing is off with this company and the materials are different so be careful when ordering."
3.0,"Way too small, despite elasticized waist. Order one or two sizes up. Otherwise, pretty cute."
3.0,Too large ordered a XL and material was thinner than I would like.
3.0,I love this style so much but it was far too short.
3.0,Returned. Not as dynamic in real life as the photo. Definitely something unique.
3.0,Nice band.  Buckle a little big and doesn't sit flat.  But all in all looks nice.
3.0,Looks great just material sweater is made from is cheap.
3.0,Probably work for others but the tails just not long enough for me
3.0,"12/05/18<br />UPDATE:  KADES is going to send me another band to replace the black/grey  one that gave me an allergic reaction on my wrist.  I will try the replacement out and then update if that causes any problems.  I didn't have a problem with the black/yellow one in the two months I wore it.  Just the black/grey.  I haven't tried the blue/white one yet. I'll up the stars to 4 because of how good their customer service has been and then update from there.  I should have taken a picture of the mark it left before but I was so worried about what was going on with my wrist.  I'll take a picture if it does it again.  For now I've switched back to the original Galaxy Watch band and the mark has gone away.<br /><br />I LOVE these bands, BUT  I bought three and wore the yellow/grey for about 2 months, no problem.  To change things up, I switched to the black/grey one.  I developed a red area on the underside of my wrist right where the metal circle for the post that resizes the band.  At first I didn't think much of it, and did my normal routine of wearing the watch in the day, take it off at night, etc.  The red area started to grow, get enflamed, and itchy.  I stopped wearing the watch and put Neosporin and Cetaphil on it.  It seemed to get worse before it got better.  After a week without the watch on and thinking I would have to go to a dermatologist, the red area crusted over and the skin looked and started to be flesh colored again instead of red, but it looked like I had a burn mark/scar.  I put the watch on my other arm then, and it started to look like I was getting little red bumps where the circle on the band was.  I tried it back on the other wrist that had the problems initially just  just to test if it really was that cirlce and after only a day, I had a red mark forming again.  I took off the band and switched to the original Samsung Watch band.<br /><br />I never had a problem with the yellow/grey band that has the same metal circle that comes in contact with my wrist so I'm not sure if all a sudden I developed an allergy to whatever metal that circle is made of on all three of the bands I got or if it's something with whatever the grey/black one's metal is made of.<br /><br />Other than the issue with the allergic reaction, the bands are great and I love them.  I'm afraid to wear them now after what happened though. :(  Maybe I can put tape or something on the circle?  I don't know what to do."
3.0,Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the zipper was off track on the butt part
3.0,Simple order. Fast shipping.
3.0,Right pants of your putting on work boots.
3.0,"As the rest of the reviews state, is a great looking shirt and you will get a lot of compliments on it... Until you wash it and it turns into a sports bra. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry as I do with all my 100% cotton clothes but it still shrunk. I would say that this shirt is more of a wear-once novelty item."
3.0,These  socks are extremely difficult to put on. They are comfortable when they are on. But just struggling to get them on is not worth it to me.
3.0,"It's exactly as described but with the head hole being lopsided, you have to wear it off your shoulder no matter what."
3.0,"It's ok, it's just a long head band."
3.0,Baby loved them
3.0,"It is the right size, but has a very strong smell of leather. Being sensitive to odors, this is a bad thing."
3.0,This is my second one of these(I lost the first). The second one is not made as well.  The stones are so small you can't see them or feel them. Gave 3 stars because the names are right.
3.0,"Looks a bit nicer in the picture, obviously.  My issue is that it keeps falling apart.  Where the strap connects to the time-keeper, specifically.  This has led to it falling apart on my hand and dropping.  Now the glass is cracked off to the side.  Also, there is an area where you feed the metal thing through the hole to strap it in.  The plastic type covering on that was falling off, so I peeled the rest off.  It doesn't look as nice now without it though.  But oh well, you get what you pay for.  I still wear the watch because of the dark green. Its okay.<br />Update: Battery lasted about 13 months."
3.0,"The necklace is very pretty in general. However, it does not glow in the dark. At all."
3.0,A 8mm lava stone will not fit it.
3.0,"This product is very cute.  You get what you see. However, it was too small for my torso. Also the material that is see-through is slightly itchy.<br /> I would have worn this if it wasn’t tight around my crotch. And even though it snaps at the bottom, it looks really bad if you undo it. So I couldn’t even get away with doing that. I had to give this to a friend but I haven’t seen her wear it so I don’t know if it fit her or is too itchy."
3.0,"Love the pattern and style of dress, but it did not fit me well. Make sure to buy a larger size when ordering."
3.0,"I really love this blazer but the color is not accurate. it's a bright bright red not the dark berry color pictured. The color is off but I wear a lot of red so it's fine with me. I also have it in white and black and I wear them a lot. I live in Tucson and it gets super hot in the summer but I also have tattoos that I need to keep covered at work, so the thin material is a win for me."
3.0,"I loved how it looked so thick under my dress, but it was WAYY TOO BIG. It made me look very frumpy. And it's very very loose. But the chiffon is definitely soft. And the layers do a good job when your swishing your skirt back and forth. It's a very full and fluffy look! If only it fit right!"
3.0,"I'd stick to wearing these in spring or fall - but not winter. They are very cozy, but my feet do get cold after a few minutes. I ended up buying a similar type pair but in the Kamik brand - more expensive but much warmer!"
3.0,Runs small. Got an extra large which just fits on my daughter who normally wears a medium
3.0,"I liked the colors. My foot is a size 10. Not narrow or wide. The fabric is kinda thin. The toes are very tight. Had to struggle to get them on. Not quite over the ankle. If your feet and toes are wide or plump, forget it. Better probably if your feet and toes are small. Disappointed"
3.0,just ok and way thinner then I had expected.. not real sure how good they will be and for a medium they seem a lil on the small side
3.0,Bought the right size for my baby’s foot but the elastic is loose and she pulls them right off. Cute though!
3.0,Color and cut of the dress is cute. Hits just at the knee (I’m 5’4”). I went by the size chart and ordered the recommended size but it’s a little big. There’s some extra fabric under the arms that makes it stick out like it’s too large. It’s an easy fix if you know how to sew so I’m keeping it anyway.<br /><br />Side note- item was shipped in a clear bag so it was visible through packaging
3.0,this wallet is well made but a little on the small size for me.  I have had to cut back on the amount of cards that I can carry. it can only hold 3 cards on one side and a driver license on the other.
3.0,I liked the sizing and comfort. The design itself is a smidge not so polished. So I would wear this for just a regular work day but not for an important meeting or anything like that. I felt that the medium fit perfect. I’m a 12 in blazers and 5’2 in height if that helps.
3.0,I have ordered first one and found damage stitches came off and requested for replacement. Second one had same problem returned it.
3.0,"I love the dress...<br />However, the specs are a bit off... Overall fit isa bit too small..."
3.0,I ordered the 8 since that's typically my pant size but it's so right! If you've got a booty go up a size or two! Super cute other than that!
3.0,The little clip was loose so my AirPods almost fell out
3.0,"Difficult to put together, too much tension on the middle section to stay together. The motor for the main unit made grinding noises and did not work."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but it is very long. I am 5&#34;4.
3.0,Love the style but it’s too tight on my upper arms and in my armpits.  A little tight around the waist.  I am 5”5 125 and athletic build 34B bra.
3.0,"These pants had the weirdest fit in the front.  Baggy in the front and crotch area, and not in a good way. The fabric was good and they looked cute when not on your body."
3.0,It was wonderful hat... it looked great but it was way to large in the bill.
3.0,I really like SmartWool socks they're very high quality comfortable and definitely good for hiking. Plan was to be extra careful and never lose these. I saw them sitting in my shoes in the same location for two days in a row and on the third day one of the socks was missing. Only got to wear them a couple times. Definitely not going to spend this much on socks anymore. Anyway all that like them the graphic does stretch out on the body and is no longer easily made out by the viewer. My sock or what happened I looked all over.
3.0,This was not made for me.  Returned.
3.0,i was very happy at first with this nightgown it was comfortable and fit nice and then I washed it.  I washed it by hand in cold with other delicates that I also had do do.  When it was dry I put it away and didn’t really look close to it. The next time I took it out to wear the lace along the back is all torn in different spots. Nothing big just little ones here and there which make it worse to try to fix
3.0,"[[ASIN:B00B5HV52O Nurse Mates Women's Halle Clogs,Black,9.5 W]]  I ordered wide width, but shoes are too narrow."
3.0,"My 15 yr. old daughter loves the headband. However, it does give her a headache after wearing it for a bit.  Its uncomfortable.  One of the ears also came unattached from the headband itself after only wearing it a couple of times."
3.0,"Such a lovely set of pajamas but the fit is off considerably.  The top is almost too small.  The capris are very big and loose.  I will have to alter the pants but will lose the use of the pockets when I do so.  Also, the pants are not a legging fit as shown on the model."
3.0,SHIRT IS AWESOME BUT WAS GIVEN BACK TO ME TO SEND BACK BCUZ IT STILL STRUK WHEN WASHED IN COLD WATER & HUNG TO DRY
3.0,Could not wear this dress...had to returned.
3.0,fits very large. super stretchy and at 5'3 its a bit too long past my knees.
3.0,Shirt is as pictured but runs smaller. Lightweight and thin material. Good for the price.
3.0,"This dress is attractive enough, but I'm not real fond of the material it's made out of.  It's very similar to cotton bedsheet material.  It's kind of stiff and definitely will need to be ironed with a hot iron to get all the wrinkles out of it.  The zipper in the back is so long that I can't zip it up all the way by myself and I have long arms.  It also had some strings hanging on it right out of the package that I had to cut off so QC might not be all that good.  I washed in the regular cycle and it came out of the dryer wrinkled, but I couldn't detect any fading or shrinking."
3.0,The material is somewhat thinner than expected and it you can see the seams stretching when pick the bag up after putting stuff in it. I'm really afraid the carry strap and handle will rip off after a couple uses. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality for the price I paid. ... Maybe we just got the lemon in the batch? This is not typical quality for Nike products.
3.0,Cute shirt and I order a size bigger then I thought I should and it's still too small. I should have went 2 sizes bigger and I would have loved it.
3.0,"This does not look exactly as shown to me...I saw this at a clothing shop and it was pretty, so when I saw it on here I thought it would be the same.  It's just a cheaper version.  The lace is kinda disappointing.  But it fits as expected and still get compliments when I wear it."
3.0,"Disappointed. The purse is very cute but cheaply made; I have had it for about 6 months and first the cute band in the front broke, then the zipper in the back, and now it's already starting to fray. Very disappointing that I already have to buy another purse because I love the look of this one but it is not at all durable."
3.0,"While the print is cute for this dress, the cut and style leaves something to be desired. The cotton fabric is really hot for tropical living. It makes a nice house or church dress, but nothing special."
3.0,The arm details on this dress are so fun and unexpected.  I'm typically an xs and ordered and xs and couldn't zip the dress in the chest so sadly it went back. It fit everywhere else like a glove.
3.0,"This is the one I liked but would not recommend.  It keeps falling apart, zipper pulls falling off and zippers breaking or not working right. It looks nice but.....time to stick to the brands I know and love."
3.0,"It's decent material.  It's hard to tell how to put it on; there isn't a tag or markings to denote the front from the back - you just have to put it on, feel it out, and then turn it around if you got it wrong. It does not fit like it does on the model (the sleeves are somewhat short) but maybe if you size-up it would."
3.0,The black ones have less stretch and are a totally different size. The great one fit great.
3.0,Work OK for the money.
3.0,"The pin itself is very nice, the problem I had was with the latch.  I couldn't get the latch open to release the pin without a pair of pliers, then once I put it on my sweater, I had to use pliers to get it to close around the pin again, the pin is now bent and it's never coming off my sweater without tearing it apart."
3.0,"Slippers are more handsome in person than in the picture. But it appears as though we got two right foot slippers—we all had a good laugh trying to decide which feet the slippers looked more appropriate on!,"
3.0,"Take care with this device.<br />When you put the brazalet in the canal , it makes little scratches !!<br />Not so good for every day work."
3.0,"It is ok for what you are paying, they are cheap chinese goodies, overall ok."
3.0,"It is a standard XL, not a plus size XL, just know that going in for sizing. I have a long torso and this was too short for comfort on me. The fabric is very soft and comfy. Would be great for yoga or stretches."
3.0,Fit was good except for across the chest and upper arms.  It was a little too tight.  Otherwise I like the length and drape of the body of the dress.  It is very flattering.
3.0,Was unhappy with my purchase but the company was generous enough to refund my money.
3.0,Nice set but the hat is HUGE.
3.0,"It works fine for about 2 hours. After that it started to get unglued, and move around."
3.0,"I’ve had great luck with this brand but this particular shirt, I wore three times before the seams started coming undone."
3.0,The crotch area is very high up compared to the legs. Uncomfortable
3.0,Don’t believe that you should size up. I’m generally a medium or size 5 and because I read the reviews I went and sized up as advised. Stick to your size !
3.0,"I'm a pretty standard medium (5'2"" 34A/B)  and this was way too big.  Too bad as it was very warm and soft!  Rather than deal with the hassle of returning, I'll add it to my donation box."
3.0,kind of cool at 18 below not as warm as they say. wore them with 45 below boots
3.0,"The sweater is soft, but the synthetic material definitely overtakes the cashmere which one could expect for the price. I am 5’7” and 135lbs ordered a small and the fit was fine. The white color was pretty. Returned."
3.0,"Cute Mickey Mouse shirt but, design fades quite a bit after a few washings."
3.0,It's don't look bad but the ring gold is a cheap looking  but hey you get what you pay .
3.0,"For the price, I'm okay with what I received. A couple of the plugs I received have cracks/chips as if they were dropped. Also, some that are supposed to be pairs look NOTHING alike - I know they're cut from stone so of course they won't be identical - that's part of the charm - but there are some that I legitimately won't wear because one looks nothing like the other. I had to work hard to figure out which ones of those went together, haha, and only figured it out by process of elimination. I also received a couple duplicates instead of all the ones pictured. Finally, I think these run a bit large. I have had my ears at 5/8&#34;/16mm for about a decade, and always have worn double-flared plugs like this, but these are ROUGH to get in and out of my ears. I'm not convinced these are 5/8&#34;. But on the bright side - they're sure as heck not going to fall out of my ears!<br />I don't want to only say bad things. These do seem like quality stone plugs. They're heavy (not too heavy, but not cheapy lightweight) and the ones I do wear look great. But be aware that you may not get exactly what is pictured, they may be in less-than-ideal shape, some pairs may not appear to be pairs, and you may struggle to get these in your ears. Up to you to decide if it's still good valu!"
3.0,Comfortable. Tongue will not flatten under laces. Needs arch support added.
3.0,beautiful yellow  necklace.  The only reason I gave three stars because some of the pieces came undone.
3.0,"Nice quality, very small.  Would possibly fit small adult."
3.0,"I loved the color. It is definitely cute.  But the headband is very stiff and the glitter gets all in your hair. It's definitely a cheap quality.  It's cute, but if I could go back I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,"Great idea, but runs small."
3.0,Pretty great sun glasses
3.0,"Not the best quality but it does the job. It is comfortable, lightweight and true to size.  It looks like polyester.  It's fair, so 3 stars."
3.0,Cheaply made and run small
3.0,Tight fit everywhere almost uncomfortable.  Nice color red however.  The fit is what I were having an issue with.  Great price point.<br />I think it would not fit well for someone with a curvy shape.
3.0,Good jacket. Good length and size was accurate.<br />Red will 100% bleed onto the white if you srent careful. I laid on my sleeve for a while and it went pink . Be careful
3.0,"Very fantastic but I’m surprised they were ok given the bag packaging<br /><br />- update I still love the product, and ordered again however this time no lens case came and they were scratched"
3.0,"I like the frames but unfortunately there is no clear focus at the top.  But full disclosure, I was leaving on vacation the very next day and I needed something to read with by the pool. Otherwise I seriously would have returned these.  Because reading by the pool is kind of the only use for these. Not clear in the description and definitely NOT what I wanted. I've been tricked. One star for the pretty frames."
3.0,"It's alright for fifteen bucks, but they need to use the right color thread."
3.0,"I’m the weird one who hated these. They are the same material as workout pants, shiny and silky but not cotton and for me jogging bottoms need to be soft and warm and wintery, these are not any of this. Hated them!"
3.0,The front bows came undone and came off but other than that it's cute on my baby
3.0,"this bra  appears to be a knock off of a Shock Absorber sports bra model, but it appears  reasonably well made and supportive, though a bit thinner.  I usually wear a 34DD in  the similar Shock Absorber bra and the 34 band fits quite  tight, but good for exercise.. The band on all the La Isla bras I tried  fit about a size looser than those others that they mimic, even on the tightest hook.....even on the tightest hook,  which some people might prefer. I prefer a really tight fitting bra for exercise . It is a tiny bit lower cut..you won't notice it much if your breasts are  not that large. In my opinion, if this  is your main bra for running or high impact exercise and you are full busted, spend the extra money and go with Shock Absorber, which is  more supportive and seems better made, overall,  but if it is an &#34;extra &#34; (i already own 3 shock absorber bras in this same style), this may be a very good cost effective choice, a it is about 1/3 ,or less , of the cost.  I ordered this in a 34DD ,but am reordering in a 32DD , to see if it will fit better or be too tight.<br /><br />I am relatively short and need to adjust the straps to the shortest length to get enough support"
3.0,The shoes themselves seem ok.  The shoestrings have began to fray and tear after only a week of wear.
3.0,"I’m 5’5” 34Chest 26Waist 135lbs and usually wear a small or medium in tshirt style dresses. Most reviews said this thing was a bag so I ordered a small thinking I can wash/dry and it will fit perfect. False. This dress is true to size. I won’t be drying it as planned because I do not want it to fit any tighter.<br /><br />The loops are sewn too high in my opinion. The tie sash has to sit all the way at the bottom of the loop to sit flush with the waist seam.<br /><br />The color is meh. Listed as light blue, but this is just blue. Not very impressive or pretty. Just blue. I would buy the olive or black if I was to repurchase. Oh and the label was cut off so I’m assuming I got a worn/returned item.<br /><br />For $14 lighting deal, I’ll keep it for an easy work outfit as long as I can keep the slit from flying open."
3.0,I like it it looks cute on
3.0,I didn’t quite fit like I thought they would
3.0,"Based off of some of the previous reviews, I ordered a smaller size and it's still way, way too big.  I would return it, but it isn't worth the hassle.  Because I haven't been able to wear it, I can't vouch for the quality, though it does seem to be acceptable."
3.0,"Really liked the picture on it but it is really big and also so is the band .a bit too big for me, like a mans watch . But very pretty .just not my size"
3.0,falling apart after the first use
3.0,It’s a very pretty shirt with bright colors but it fit way smaller and tighter than expected. I ordered my true size so I would recommend sizing up for a looser fit.
3.0,"Beautiful variety of the magnetic ring colors to go with any outfit! However I noticed after about 45 mins to an hour or so you’ll begin to feel a burning sensation in your nostrils and it becomes quite irritable if you keep it in longer with the burning sensation happening. Even trying to remove the magnetic ring it still leaves your nose sore and hurting. I wouldn’t recommend for a long use of wear which really sucks if your out at a bar, club, kicking with friends or whatever. Im assuming when your nose might get moisture from the inside and it hits your ring that’s what causes the burning sensation which makes it quite uncomfortable."
3.0,The crystal pendant is very beautiful but the necklace itself felt cheaply made but I am satisfied with it just because my boyfriend is satisfied and he really likes it.
3.0,Cute but a little snug around the waist.  Zipper is hard to zip up
3.0,"it feels a bit chintzy and cheap, but no one can tell that from 5 feet away.  With that in mind, its a good costume pocket watch that has the added bonus of actually telling the time.<br /><br />warning:  the ticking is so loud that we have to keep it in a separate room under a blanket when not in use."
3.0,Very nice bathing suit. Teal is the same color as the picture.  Size runs very small.  I'm 5'2&#34; 140 lbs and ordered and XL and it was still too small.
3.0,You get what you pay for. I have slender forearms/hands/fingers. They barely fit over my elbows however they were baggy at my wrists. It just didn't seem proportionate. If your wrists fit this glove I would gues that you wouldn't be able to get it anywhere close to your elbows. They do the job well enough though.
3.0,Not enough support.
3.0,Wish this product had more room but other than that it’s very nice
3.0,Okay office shirt
3.0,Nice soft material. A little to big but like it
3.0,Pearls are huge
3.0,"really cute, but order larger size"
3.0,When I walk it get twisted around my body
3.0,"I am 5’4” and 180lbs, I bought an xl…and it was about 8 inches too long and huge. I cut the bottom off and It’s very comfy as a pj dress now."
3.0,sizing is really off for yoga pants. runs very large
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter as a gift, I think she liked them as she loves butterflies, but she hasn't worn them yet. I am suspecting they are a little too small and dainty compared to her normal taste in earrings. These are a bit smaller than I imagined them from the picture. I really need to get out a ruler and check dimensions on products more, because pictures can be deceiving. So I think they seem well made and are pretty, just be aware that they are not very eye catching and they are smaller than a lot of dangly earrings of today's styles."
3.0,shapeless. made me look huge
3.0,It’s weird they are definitely hot pink in person but they photograph orange. I wanted Orange 🤨
3.0,Too small. I ordered a size 13
3.0,"I like this shirt alright, but it's not my go-to favorite.  The material is nice and soft, definitely a polyester feel, but not a bad one.  It's not as long as the one in the picture, which is what I was hoping for.  I really like longer shirts, and this one comes just a little below my pants.  Again, nothing terrible, just I have a preference for longer shirts.<br /><br />The thing that brings my rating down in the sleeves.  You can wear the shirt as a 3/4 length sleeve shirt, or roll the sleeves up a little to show the tie to tie them up to the metal D rings on the upper part of the sleeve.  I can't, for the life of me, figure out how to get those to stay up.  So I just wear it with the sleeves down, and these empty D rings hanging.<br /><br />It is comfy, for the most part.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
3.0,"Bought these to work in without staining up all my other clothes, hopefully as a cheaper alternative to the dickies I use when working on equipment. I am 6ft 1in and 265# I had no problems with the fitment around the midsection, but through the chest, shoulders, arms it was VERY tight. (I wear a size 58 jacket and size 34-36 pants)<br />The opening isn't long enough, and while I was able to ""fit"" in them, I felt like the hulk about to bust out of them. The sleeves only went to my elbows. THey are very light though, and if they were bigger, I'd probably like them."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, I definitely could have sized up, I ordered a large and it was snug which I wouldn’t have hated but the front slit is extremely indecent. This dress was for a gatsby gala with my husbands work company and my lady parts we’re about to jump out just walking down my hallway nvm sitting or dancing. The overall look and quality however were very nice! Wish it had fit differently"
3.0,"I am very happy with the quality of the rings. Unfortunately, the sizes are not similar to my usual rings. The package says 6,6.5,7 and they are all way too big.  That is very disappointing."
3.0,"very tight. the following socks fit me better:  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQWV2HS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00<br />J.Ann 3-Pair/Pack Fashion Cotton Referee/ Soccer Knee High Socks, Size:9-11"
3.0,"Don't be misled, This is not a double ball earring. Just a typical backed extremely small gold ball earring. I was looking for the one with the ball that screws on the back so both sides look the same. They offered to refund my money but by the time I paid shipping, it was not worth the hassel."
3.0,The shirt feels light for summer but too large around the waist. It fits like a parachute unless I tuck the excess down. Not into the moomoo style.
3.0,"A nice bib for an adult. I would give it more stars it it were a bit shorter. It is quite long, unnecessarily so."
3.0,"This BAGVIO set consists of 2 same size packing cubes that are made of a medium weight fabric and medium duty zippers.  The main zipper opens the packing compartment to a halfway point (unlike packing cubes which zip to fully open), and the second zipper expands/widens the packing compartment.<br /><br />To fill, expand the cube and put in your clothes.  Close the main zipper and then zip up the expansion zipper to ""compress"" the cube.  By doing this, you do squish your clothes and the bag does get smaller (obviously, the expansion portion of the cube is zipped up), thereby allowing you to save some space in your luggage.  For this reason, I rate these BAGVIO packing cubes higher than standard packing cubes.<br /><br />However, if you've ever used true compression bags, these BAGVIO cubes are nothing like true air-removing compression bags and cannot compete with the packability of compression bags.  Your clothes will wrinkle using either method, but the air removal feature of the compression bag allows more clothes in the suitcase than these compression cubes."
3.0,"Nice quality pants, but way way too small"
3.0,Looks as described but way bigger than sized. 0-6 is more like 12 months. Pretty cheaply made but decent for price. Showed up in quotes time frame.
3.0,"I bought 2 of these.  One for me to wear and one for my daughter who moved to a different state recently.  I thought it would be nice for both of us to wear them.  However, for the price the ring is very flimsy and seems to get hung up on everything.  If you get it hung up, the metal totally bends out of shape.  The good thing is that it is one size fits all but for the price I wish it was a little more substantial of a metal.  My daughter said she can't wear because she has a toddler and it gets caught on everything."
3.0,"Like others, I do like the design of the ring.  It's extremely disappointing to have received a stone with absolutely no fluorescence at all. It looks like a cloudy, glass marble, not a moonstone. The sterling is well-polished, and it does seem that the stone is well-set and secure.<br /><br />I'm going to live with it for today, but I think it's going back.  My other moonstone jewelry is wonderfully luminescent, and this piece simply doesn't go with it.<br /><br />The search for a moonstone ring continues....."
3.0,"I Purchased one a couple of weeks ago then within a week it changed colors so I contacted the company and the company send me another at no cost and assured me that it won't change color so we will see, I will update within 2 weeks of this post. Besides that, it is very pretty and shiny!"
3.0,I'm not sure how the pants fit yet.  They look fine but they do have an overwhelming chemical smell to them.  I would suggest washing them a couple times before you wear them.
3.0,Not khaki as expected. More brown.
3.0,"Muy grande, la tela es bonita, es lino crudo"
3.0,Super cute fit. Product came with broken zipper
3.0,"I wanted to love this jacket so badly, if only it was about 4 inches longer! Alas, it was WAY too short. Like, comically short. It ended about 3 inches under my bust, not a great look! If it HAD been long enough, I would have kept it and cherished it as a mainstay of my wardrobe - I agree with other reviews that it is super soft and stretchy and the color is great. I am 5'6&#34;, bra size 34DD with really wide shoulders. Other than the shortness it fit exactly how I wanted - there was no way it would button over my chest, but looked great as a top layer over other shirts."
3.0,"The fibers are not itchy as you may have read in other reviews. But I would also not describe the fibers as soft. In short, the shirt is sturdy and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I have soaked the shirt in 1 gallon of tap water and two cups of vinegar for two hours then promptly blanched it in cold water with ice cubes for one minute. This does not affect the shirts black color density. I think it softened the texture of the shirt but I'm not sure if I like it more or less then before. The seams of the shirt seem particularly durable. I'm not sure if I recommend this product. I suggest reading more reviews of this shirt and others on amazon before making a decision. I hope you find this review helpful."
3.0,"Pros: size was close enough.<br /><br />Cons: The fabric on the arms is pretty uncomfortable, itchy it times. The slot to put elbow padding in is open at the bottom (on the inside), so they shift down even when cut to size.<br /><br />Overall It's ok, but I would not buy this again and wish I hadn't missed the return window. Not worth the $26."
3.0,"I was disappointed because thr color doesnt match the watch like the picture at all, otherwise its a nice band, adjusting is straightforward you just have to play with it to get the pins to line up"
3.0,It was fine since my granddaughter is only r years old. Was a good size for her.
3.0,I ordered the purple dress. It is not at all the color in the photo. It came in more of a plum/color of Barney the dinosaur not the dark royal purple that it looks like. very disappointed in that.  Otherwise the material is nice.
3.0,It's nice for a swim cover.
3.0,"The skirt is okay, but wasn't what I was expecting. I could not zip the skirt up all the way either. It will be perfect for someone who is tiny."
3.0,Skirt
3.0,The part around your wrist isn't fitting way too loose and short in arm length and at waist.
3.0,"This t-shirt fabric is soft but the graphic is printed on top of the fabric and is stiff. Also, it's a synthetic fabric and does not breathe well. So, not good for outdoor activities like hiking, beach, etc. The design and colors look good but the big problem is that the fit is off, like the pattern was off. The shoulder seams do not fall where they should, which should be where the shoulder ends and the arm begins. Instead, the shoulder seams are about two inches down on the side of the arms, making the fit uncomfortable and weird. It just doesn't sit right."
3.0,"nice fabric, short torso, had to return because the romper was too small"
3.0,"I love the style and fit of the shoe; however,  I feel the quality is not as expected. It is thin and more of a beach flip flop material. If the top was mounted on a better quality sole, definitely would have been worth it. Will keep and see how long they last."
3.0,"Just got these less than a week ago and I have been wearing 2 at one time hoping for quick results with my wrist tendon issue.  Currently, I still have pain and I'm scheduled for surgery in 2 weeks so I hope I get some relief soon.<br />The bracelets are quite nice looking, comfortable, well designed and easy to use. I wear them all day & night long - only taking them off when I shower."
3.0,"It's really cute put the material is really poor, I might only be able to wear it once"
3.0,"Unfortunately these goggles came to me with the case completely broken and the goggles slightly scratched because of the damage to the case.<br /><br />Aside from the damaged and somewhat flimsy case, the goggles worked fairly well for swimming in the ocean. Not too dark but good for sunny days as well. Prescription seemed to be pretty accurate. Wasn't as clear though because of the scratches on the goggles.<br /><br />Overall, disappointed with the product I received but if you get one that's not damaged, it should work well."
3.0,I was so excited when I order this cover over because it would be just in time for my upcoming vacation but when I received it this cover over is not meant to fit all sizes and your body has to be built a certain way.  I gave this product three out of five star rating due to the fact that the cover over does not even cover my bottom which is why I need a cover over... It barely gets over my hips which is personally not something I am looking for in a cover over.  The colors are a great combination which is why I gave this product some sort of rating and the material of the cover over is lightweight and perfect for going over your swimsuit.  Overall based on my experience with this product I just wish the company offered more of a variety of sizes.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount rate or free in exchange of an honest review.
3.0,"These are cute, not as deep red as I was hoping for but I wouldn’t have minded however the right shoe is definitely a half size smaller than the left. And no, my feet do not differ that much in size. The left shoe was super comfy and roomy but the right I could barely squeeze my foot into it. Sadly I have to send them back."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this and wanted to give it as a gift to my mom for mother’s day, however, it came WITHOUT the chain and NOW I’ve been searching for a matching chain to go with it and so far no luck. That’s the most disappointing thing about this purchase."
3.0,"Great durable boots and I love them but the reason I left off two stars was because they are not as tall in the heel as advertised. I needed this specific function, so they will not be used for what they were intended but I still like them and will use them differently."
3.0,The quality isn’t what I hoped for - it isn’t vibrant in color and several stones had fallen off into the packaging- I love the meaning behind the tree of life but wished it was better quality.
3.0,"Leopard Print Dress ran small on mr-waist and hips, a little big in the bust, at least for me. Ordering a larger size because it’s really cute."
3.0,ok item
3.0,"These Skyway Aviator Polarized Oversized Sunglasses are definitely big.  They put the ""over"" in oversized.  I actually appreciate this fact, as they protect a larger area around the eye than standard sunglasses, but I can see where this might be a turn off for some folks.<br /><br />  I'm not an extremely fashionable guy, but these glasses don't give off a very fashionable vibe.  They have a whole ""guy attempting to look wealthier than he really is"" air about them.  I can see these on a dude from the 70's with his shirt open and a hairy chest.<br /><br />These glasses also sit very high on my nose.  This allows light to crawl in from beneath the lenses.  The sides and top are protected well.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses are definitely a bold and/or unusual fashion choice.  I'll wear them while driving, but that's about it."
3.0,"They're good if you have a rock hard physique. This material cannot handle an ample belly. In the same size, a large classic fitted pair of boxers fit perfect from banana republic or American eagle."
3.0,The dress is cute but short in the back and I don't even have a big booty. I'll have to wear with tights or a long jacket.
3.0,Very wrinkled & seems skimpy
3.0,Earrings are nice but too small. Picture does not show how tiny these huggies are.
3.0,"Shirt is very small thru the shoulders and chest, loose thru the hips!"
3.0,Not the best quality as it is not as “lifelike” as the other masks.
3.0,"The pendant is beautiful, the chain not so much.. it tarnished in one day. The pendant is a great gift, however if you want to give it with a chain, I would recommend buying a different chain."
3.0,It’s a lot smaller then the Ani bracelets (Circumference) ..It’s more of a children’s size then an adults.
3.0,"Diffidently a great idea for a product when it comes to organizing your luggage, easy to pack and access your things, especial when you are traveling multiple destinations, its easy to pull a bag...and find exactly what you need. The reason i gave 3-starts is because i was only able to use it once, for my second trip the zippers were already coming apart. the laundry bags are a way small for any laundry.. but to store your make up and other small staff that can be lost around in the luggage its works fine. (for the price the quality of the product is acceptable)"
3.0,To many letters are to light in color.
3.0,I say somewhat small because I have hips. They were actually ok and almost too big in all other areas. I am short with hips so this is the story of my life. I had them hemmed.
3.0,This was ok.  Not great but was able to wear it.
3.0,"fit was okay. i have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say these arent see thru. i ordered the black/gray two pack, and the gray is amazing, comfy, fits just right. the black however is horrifically see thru. would not purchase again."
3.0,a little on the small size doth.
3.0,"Looks great, especially in photos, but one claw had the tip broken upon arrival. Definitely do not drop these."
3.0,"See through, so comfortable! Might try the black ones"
3.0,"I initially rated this a 5 star but after a few months of having it I had to change it. I know it's cheap, which is why I didn't have high expectations, but the chain is completely tarnished and the pendant has fallen off at least 7 times as well as the actual tree circle piece. I plan on buying a good chain, though, because I still love it!"
3.0,"Unfortunately, it was too small for me at the eye  openings making it very uncomfortable. I had my 13 year old try it on and it didn't fit her eyes either.  I was unable to wear it so plan on returning.  It's really quite expensive for what it is - The lace is quite rough as well, though I guess it couldn't be too soft and still hold its form.  Perhaps for a child or someone with closer set eyes."
3.0,"These gloves are very stylish, soft and warm. They are perfect for women with long fingers. If your fingers are medium or short in length you won't be happy with these gloves. Unfortunately they will not work on my touch screen. I don't have a screen protector on my phone so that isn't the problem. Having to take them off to use my phone is very inconvenient."
3.0,I loved the look of the dress but the material was not the best for the style.
3.0,"Overall, this lock does what it advertises. The carabiner is large enough to put on a 1.5 inch bar and the combo is easy to set. The bar works with my Shoei RF1400 as well as my Shuberth C6 with ratcheting chin strap.<br />The quality of the build is cheap. The gate on the carabiner is loose, the rivet holding it on isn't very tight. The combination dial and locking mechanism is made of plastic,  which appears to not be very durable.. The carabiner body is covered with a thick foam which looks like it will prevent scratching whatever you attach it to. The lock bar is made of thin pot-metal which isn't very strong.<br />This may lock my helmet but I doubt it'll stop a thief. I'm a little disappointed."
3.0,The material was thinner than I thought it would be.
3.0,"The fit is as expected, but the fabric looks and feels terrible. It is a dress however, so I’ve given it three stars. The dress is now on its way to charity."
3.0,"I bought this fascinator for my trip to this year's Kentucky Derby.  I was absolutely disgusted when it arrived and there were hairs on it already!!!!  I wanted to throw up and send it back!  But I decided to clean and sanitize it instead.  Mine never really fluffed up like it said it would, so instead I used a hot iron (for hair) and I curled up the pieces so it would look a little nicer and stand out more instead of laying flat.  It worked really nice for the Fillies and Lilies cocktail party (KD Kickoff party at Churchill Downs) that my boyfriend and I attended.  I would probably not purchase again due to the digust factor, but it did work for what I needed it to."
3.0,they were pretty but much smaller than I expected
3.0,"This is a rough tough bag, but it does not come smooth as per its photo. It is all crumpled up and you have to. use it for a long time I think before it fully opens up and smooths out. Sorry. That's the way I see it."
3.0,"Another review described the bag as something for a &#34;little girl.&#34; It is smaller than I imagined even with the dimensions being provided but ok for my needs. I'm just not so sure it was worth the price. If you're looking for a purse for a little girl, this bag would serve that purpose as well."
3.0,These are really cute but way too big for my newborn!
3.0,I ussse them on my hats.
3.0,"Cute and great swimsuit coverup for the price, but the material is a bit heavier then I expected so it gets really hot if you wear it in the sun too long."
3.0,"wasnt the best fit for me, it fit me, just didnt look right on me, im a size16/18 and i got 3x"
3.0,They aren’t exactly perfect for night vision . Anti glare only good for regular car headlights but won’t work for those new trucks headlights or the new car’s bright white lights. Are these really polarized?
3.0,My HTV vinyl needed to be heat pressed more…part of stencil is sticking up.  And if you wear an XL it will be snug.  A bit disappointed that I will have to heat press again in order to wear it.
3.0,"Very nice quality and looks as pictured, but...  Due to previous reviews I knew that it runs small, but I thought going up 2 sizes would be enough, it wasn't.  I normally wear a US L-Xl, ordered 2Xl.  It is a total of 40 inches at the bust.  Fits as a long shrug, not a cardigan.  I will keep for use with short sleeved or sleeveless tops/dresses, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,I ordered an XL because they recommended that based on previous purchases.  It was so tight I had to have help getting it off. Then I tried a 3XL and it wasn't much bigger.
3.0,the overalls are nice but the top is way to big and like a silky material....kinda cheap like....
3.0,"It took a while to warm up, Not as warm as expected"
3.0,"It looks just like the pictures, not the kind of clutch I'm looking for."
3.0,"It's cute but there was a rip in the seam and it runs small. I wear a 2x usually but got the 3x it fits, but the arms are still a little tight"
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately only gets 4 stars from me because it didn't fit me well at all.  Usually I'm an XL so I ordered that size... The dress literally came down to almost my ankles.  Definitely didn't fit like the picture and was a lot longer.  I'm 5&#34;3 so I'm on the short side but not so short that it should go down that far.  I wish it would have fit me better because like I said, it really was a beautiful dress."
3.0,These things are absolutely MASSIVE. Having said that I'm sure the sun won't hit any part of your face while wearing them.<br />They'll be nice when I go to lay out in the sun
3.0,Very thin material but for the price its ok...
3.0,Super soft. Love it. Color was off. The brown looks like it’s a pale pink.
3.0,Hard to tell it's an elephant unless you know what you are looking for
3.0,"The size runs large and the cut was sort of boxy. The thin material will show any lines or bumps underneath. The plink color is pretty and it is comfortable. I'm 5'6&#34; and it comes to my knees, so definitely longer than pictured."
3.0,Cheap jewelry. Turned fingers green. Fine for short term wear bc they are cute
3.0,"Cute, but zipper broke right after receiving."
3.0,This bracelet is really really big - I wish this bracelet was half its size - That's the only problem with the bracelet (size)
3.0,It is a pretty ring. I'm not sure how long it will last before it starts to turn my finger green!
3.0,Looks great but started discoloring my skin after one a couple of weeks. A true stainless steel wouldn’t do that. Sad that i can’t wear it every day
3.0,"These are great, but my chapstick falls out! I got my mom to sew a flap on the top to keep it from flying out all the time!"
3.0,The engraving is very hard to read other than that nice ring
3.0,I wear a 9.5 so I ordered a 10. The length is perfect but they are way too loose. Super cute if they would stay on my feet. Maybe made for someone with wider feet?
3.0,Loved the hat and the color but I sent it back because the wool was itchy on my forehead. Would be great with a liner. If I could sew I would have added one. Otherwise love the hat.
3.0,I got a bunch of silk masks from a several companies. The colored ones fit great the elastic makes it fit just about anyone but the prints and color selection are not so good. I ordered 3 total. I ordered the blue and the pink and they fit great.  THE BLACK which is probably the most popular is the worst fit!! You might as well just go to the fabric store cut a piece of silk from something and throw an elastic on it and call it a mask. I am actually slightly upset about the black one.
3.0,I think these would probably be a bit big on most women.
3.0,"Ok, so the bag had all the right things to look like a real coach like the number in leather inside but the bag just felt poorly made. The zipper is definitely not coach. And there were dents permanently in my straps. I have owned real coach bags before and did not look and feel like this. I guess you get what you pay for though. I will be returning this."
3.0,"The brim is much smaller than expected and it was tightly fitting my head. It did fit my daughter’s head, but unfortunately she didn’t like the style."
3.0,need to make larger
3.0,"The look is nice, but the description says 44&#34; when it's actually 40&#34;"
3.0,"Pretty stones, but the hardware was very large. It didn't fit well inside my piercing because I'm on the skinnier side. The setting was also crooked on quite a few of the stones. Overall, very pretty though. Good value for the price."
3.0,"These are soft & squat proof. I can fit a size Small or Medium but I usually get a size small, which is what I did with these. However, they tend to slid down because they’re a little big, so I’m often pulling them up - I think a size down would’ve been great, but I never order a XS, so something to consider. Otherwise, great leggings for hanging out in!"
3.0,"Not a heavy sweatshirt, more like a long sleeve shirt with a hood, but I covers the bits and pieces it needs to. Honestly I only got it because it said ""Basic"" and I find it hilarious"
3.0,"I've got a problem reviewing this.  The size is perfect.  The bag is functional.<br /><br />The problem is that it smells of mold/mildew.  I aired it out for a few days and tried Febreeze and some other products, but it still stinks, so I have to send it back.<br /><br />Otherwise, I would have kept it and probably given it five stars."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress! I tried to love this dress! I first ordered a Large since I usually wear a size 12 in dresses, it seemed a bit snug around the belly so I returned it and ordered an XL. SO AWKWARD! It turns out it wasn’t that the L didn’t fit, it’s just designed super awkwardly. The waist/belly/hip area has these strips of lace, I guess you’d call it, and it totally accentuates that “problem area”. Unless you are super thin and no belly I’d save your money. Now I have to get yet another dress."
3.0,I really like this but it’s to large.
3.0,"Well, I really really wanted to like this, but it made me look so bulky and square, which is what no woman wants. I had tried on other versions, so I know they can look good, but I was trying to save a few $$$. Putting it on it looked like I'd just wrapped a blanket around my self and called it a day. The fabric is really limp so it doesn't hold its shape at all. Perhaps pressing/ironing the jacket would have made it more flattering... Perhaps a shorter version where you can actually see someone's waist would also work better.<br />3 stars because it seemed to be well made, there was an inner lining which is nice."
3.0,It’s hard to pick bras online — a fact — this was way off<br />For me tho—- followed chart and to large had to return
3.0,"Like the caps and bought them because I wear glasses and thought having buttons to hold my mask was brilliant. I didn’t give it 5 stars because the buttons on caps were falling off/not very secure when received, so not very  functional. When paying for a product customers shouldn’t have to spend their time and effort trying to fix a sellers problem. We expect to receive quality product."
3.0,"I love this set of purses for an inexpensive, everyday use. However the handle of the zipper broke off on my second use. I'm still using it and looking for a replacement handle. The material is holding up in the mean time."
3.0,Nice hats and look well made. But the &#34;Burgundy&#34; hat is Santa red.
3.0,it is good and cheap.
3.0,"The sweater is nice, but the sleeves are way too tight."
3.0,As long as you purchase a couple of sizes up you should be fine. the material is kind of thin. The color is exactly as shown.
3.0,"Just a heads up. This thing is larger than the slim sleeve. And while it is water resistant, it is not waterproof. Water eventually seeps into the small opening of the zipper ends."
3.0,I am 5'1 at 125lbs. Very curvy bottom and small top. I usually wear a size small in everything. I ordered this dress in a large and it fits perfect. It fits really baggy which I wanted. The fabric is thin which will be good for summer. But the fabric also static clings really bad. Im hoping a wash and dry will fix that. I really wouldn't recommend buying it though just because it feels so cheap.
3.0,Super cute but crochet part of sleeves are tight.  Just not as comfortable as I had hoped.  Pattern is cute just as pictured
3.0,"Nice, but smaller than expected."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:83017efb33a5e636270a45680f912476]] Holes To Put Stakes In Are Hard To Find At First  And Somewhat Tricky Fo Insert. I Wish Item Was A Littlr Larger But Overall Nice Product.
3.0,Shape kind of weird! But it's different!
3.0,I received white in stead pink.
3.0,"It did not fit, it was small"
3.0,"Too big, kind of see thru, light cotton material"
3.0,"Color was pretty and the material was lightweight, which would have been nice for summer.  I found the top too large, with one side frequently sliding off revealing too much cleavage.  In the model picture the waistline falls slightly above the hips, with the top looking about as long as the bottom, but when I wore it the bottoms seemed overly large.  Just wasn't the look I was going for, I donated it to someone else who it was a better fit for."
3.0,"I really like the style, but the sizing is way off. I will return it and order a larger size."
3.0,"I really enjoyed wearing these but they broke way too easily. I have ordered them are than once, too."
3.0,Cut a little to small
3.0,"I got the size XS as I am pretty skinny. The paints quality is good but too short for my height, 5'7&#34; (110lb)."
3.0,"The color of the orange was much duller than I had anticipated, and that is why I sent it back. The quality and the price was fantastic, but I was looking for something fun and bright."
3.0,"Lining's starting to come apart, but this bag goes through A LOT. Still think it's good for the price."
3.0,Work but ear muff part detaches too easily for a kid to manage. I’m constantly reatthing the ear pieces.
3.0,The cash section feels very cheap and the mask on the front is crooked. Otherwise it's a decent wallet but it can be hard to get cards in and out.
3.0,"Pretty color, shirt was very large I had to return it."
3.0,"My roommate needed a new winter jacket and I'd just purchased one in Kohl's, but they didn't have his size. So we ordered a 3x from this seller. It's great quality, came in pretty fast considering, and seems very heavy duty. But the size of it was more like a youth XL. It didn't fit my SIL or Sister, who are both a bit skinnier. And only fit my 11 year old niece but just barely. We'd return it, but we gifted the adorable socks to my boyfriend who loves funky socks.<br />Just beware of the size, otherwise good quality."
3.0,"Faux fur isn't soft like I thought it would be. A little thin, but fits well."
3.0,"this is cool, but 2 do not work.  can not contact seller. my kids dont wanna send the whole thing back. they are having fun with the rest of them. frustrating"
3.0,"The footbed is very comfortable, better than my Birks. But the strap is huge, bulging away from the top of my foot. May keep just as house slippers."
3.0,"I bought this shirt for my husband who wears an XL.  After we washed it, it shrank a little and now he says it is pretty tight.  I would order one size up in this shirt to allow for shrinking.  He loves the design."
3.0,"I bought these last year December 2021. I wore them for a trip for two weeks that December. I pulled them out this week, Nov 2022 and wore them one day. Half way through the day looked down and the toe has cracked all along the front. So, totally if two and a half weeks of use and they are no longer water proof. They have been kept in my closet. No reason these should have cracked like that other than low quality."
3.0,"It's not as stretchy as I was hoping. Not as cute with leggings as I thought it would be. The collar is annoying in the back. It sticks up, not much you can so about it."
3.0,I cannot get them own or off.
3.0,"They look cool, and the lense size is what I was looking for, but the lenses are placed very close together and the frame is way too narrow. They had to bend outwards to fit around my face and I have a relatively small face/head, which I why I have a hard time finding sunglasses that aren't too big. I feel like these were made for children."
3.0,Ordered Small 7-8<br />Pair Received:<br />Inner Tag &#34;Medium 9-10&#34;<br />Sole Bottom Molded Stamp &#34;(S) 7-8&#34;
3.0,The bunny comes as advertised. I do think it is super cute however the eyes are completely covered by its fur. I recommend a hair cut if you buy.
3.0,Ordered a L but fit tight. Straps too short. And material feels like canvas. Rough.
3.0,"The look was cheap, but I guess for the price I can't complain too much."
3.0,I'm 5'2 and 110lb I got a small and when I bend over they are see through. Very comfortable though.
3.0,dress was a little snug for me all so I ordered a blk n white dress got a blk n blue one will be returning
3.0,Much to short6
3.0,I was disappointed it did not have pockets. There were so many color choices with and without side pockets that I got mixed up. I also thought I was ordering a darker purple pair and they were a pretty bright purple. So I had to return.
3.0,The tie string broke the first time putting it on.
3.0,Not the material I was hoping for.
3.0,"is beautiful, but the fastener leaves a lot to be desired, it falls off, regularly, it needs a magnet closure, or another closure. otherwise, would be amazing."
3.0,They arrived on time and as described. I have always been a C with Victoria Secret. I order my normal size and they are way to big! I love the thick strap and they are comfortable. The lace is not scratchy. I would recommend but will order a smaller cup.
3.0,"The shirt fit great! I'm a size 12/14 with a large bust and the L fit great but... the material is definitely not what I expected. I expect a stretch dress material not a semi fuzzy sweater. It will definitely has annoying fuzz balls under the arm after wearing, from friction. I also believe the quality of material will fuzz heavily if not washed alone on delicates cycle and hung to dry."
3.0,"Overall good value for money. Slight issues described below, but not deal breakers.<br />Had for a month now.<br />Hat is warm.<br />Speakers are a little thick.<br />Speakers sound pretty good for talk radio and music too.<br />Fabric slips around when trying to insert micro-usb to charge.<br />Paired well with iPhone and iPad; took some time with Android Nexus 7 Tablet, but finally got it. Pairs with MacBook Pro OK too.<br />Switches feel/sound a little flimsy, but so far so good.<br />One volume switch when held does not decrease volume repeatedly, other one increases volume  incrementally as designed.<br />The band of fabric inside where zipper runs around your head is somewhat restricting for my big Euro fat-head; I have to pull the hat on, then grab it with both hands and pull down firmly to seat it with speakers level with my head, and occasionally need to place it properly again after some use.<br />Weakest point for me is the runtime on the battery; about three hours with talk radio show. I have an Aftershokz Titanium headset with tiny earpieces and it actually plays for about 1 1/2 work days, really, 12-15 hours!, so a little disappointed in the Cap runtime, but is OK really; time to take a break after 3 hours in the cold cutting firewood or planting trees.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Aftershokz-AS600IG-Titanium-Conduction-Headphones/dp/B018XNGQOE?th=1"
3.0,The post length is a little too short. Risk of the back falling off.
3.0,Skirt keeps riding up a bit
3.0,Super soft material! It’s a cute dress but definitely is sized a little large. It hangs off my daughter’s shoulders and is much too big in the waist.
3.0,Super cute earrings but a little too cheap for the structure. I just received them but the post is breaking off as shown in photo. The iridescent (?) material on the same one looks crinkly as opposed to the other earring.
3.0,"I should have listened to the reviews. There is a definite distortion to vision with the transition of the reader portion to the clear portion of the lens. The concept it wonderful, but they need to tweak the product. To me, it’s not worth spending money or hope on this product."
3.0,This was a very loose yoga pants. Could not keep them up at all.
3.0,"These leggings are extremely warm, so warm that I can't wear them for just being indoors. They would make a good layer for being out in the cold (like long underwear) and that is how I will use them. They sag terribly so being underneath other pants would prevent that."
3.0,Material is tight and not very breathable
3.0,quality is okay-ish. probably won't wear it again.
3.0,I have ordered a pair of ruby stud earrings before. And this time i ordered 'garnet'.They look pretty but came with a little problemed back pieces that are crooked. For some reason this 'garnet' look exactly like the ruby ones to me! I am not sure if both are ruby or both are garnet!!
3.0,"This dress looks so cute in the picture, but it is a different story on a body. At least on the dress I received, the waist of the skirt sits a bit above the natural waist (the bottom of the waist band is at the natural waist). This is not how it looks in the picture, and the difference is too much for me to keep the otherwise very nice dress. The way it is cut, it gives the impression that it is a child's rather than a woman's dress--particularly damaging appearance if you are already a petite woman who teaches college kids. Now, to be fair to the dress and dress-makers, I am busty and it is possible that that is why it sits where it does on my body. If you are small-chested, perhaps you may not have this problem. Nevertheless, it makes me look like I am wearing a woman-sized girl's dress and must go back."
3.0,Exactly as appears
3.0,"Totally wrong size, centimeters rather than inches perhaps? Went back."
3.0,"I always buy medium. Since the description says, “true to size,” I ordered medium. The were way too short and tight in the legs. They’re soft but very light weight and thin."
3.0,Color not as bright as pictured.
3.0,"The bandana colors that I received are beautiful.  However, out of 240 bandanas, I only received 2 black and 2 light pink.  I did not receive any of the light yellow.  Will I be receiving more of these colors?  What happened?  Thank you!"
3.0,"Returned, didn't look like that at all on"
3.0,the earring is very pretty but one of the clasps is very weak. I'm afraid it will open while I'm wearing them. the pearl is a good size but the top part is very small. Hard for me to fasten.
3.0,"Voice accent on some of the numbers not understandable for the elderly, especially for those with hearing problems."
3.0,"I loved this dress, however I ruined it when I accidentally dried it in the dyer. It shrank so much that it no longer covers my behind. The outer shell of the dress shrank about 2 inches shorter slip, making it visible. I'm unable to wear the dress again :/"
3.0,"As a butterfly enthusiast, I have to point out that these wings represent the monarch butterfly in a different color.  Blue morphos are completely different.  The wings are still beautiful, though."
3.0,Fits well numbers and hands quite visible for the visually impaired shedding time date very difficult for someone visually impaired. Should have put a button for  button at 4 o’clock position also should have come pre- set to at least time date year etc. by tagging response questions to order.
3.0,I am only returning ONE of the same items. The handle broke practically out of the box. The second one is fine thus far and is a hit with the grandsons.
3.0,"They looked great but broke the second time he wore them. Granted, he was shoveling snow and had gloves on that were probably pushing up against them, but still. Just know that they’re probably fine for the occasional wear for a special event, but aren’t going to hold up to a long day."
3.0,Really nice looking shirt but runs VERY small. Ordered men’s XXXL and it looked like a men’s L.
3.0,"Bought the shirt for my wife and it is really cool, but seems to be a little smaller than the the other shirts that I've bought for her of the same size."
3.0,More like a work shirt than a dress shirt
3.0,"Very thin padding on the bottom, can feel everything you step on."
3.0,It's so cute my 1 year old who i got size 18m and it's waistband is too tight so is the headband. My opinion Size up 2 sizes<br /> I havent washed it yet but I know this material shrinks from past experiances. But it's still adorable and i like the material
3.0,Loved the color and style. It just didn't fit me.  The material seems thin but maybe if had not been a snug fit it might not  have mattered.
3.0,"I love the low V neck, however these shirts fit extremely small."
3.0,Good product especially the pricing
3.0,Simply does not have the &#34;feel&#34; of a hand tooled wallet. Just more of a mass produced stamped wallet. I was also hoping for a larger change purse. But perhaps everything will be better after it is broken in.
3.0,Pretty but broke right away!
3.0,"The graphic is just as expected. However, the fit is not. It was super fitted on me, not loose like the model. The shirt itself is a stretchy material and I definitely expected more of a loose cotton like the model in the photo. Order a size up."
3.0,If you are a 36b or larger this can not be used. Difficult to close with more then one bra in it.  A great travel gift for small breasted people.
3.0,"It's a watch band, what more do you want? I like the style and I like it being adjustable. But its a watch band, so 3 stars."
3.0,"I ordered bigger based off reviews and the size chart. I can't use these if weight loss happens as I'm on the smallest size. These will induce sweating but the whole point is to lose weight so if you buy a size that will not support weight loss, it's a waste of money."
3.0,it was smaller than men double xl
3.0,"This dress fit perfect. I loved the way it fit, it was comfortable and could be very easily dress up for any occasion with a cute statement necklace. I am 5'4 and aprox 150 pounds and got a medium. I unfortunately had to return due to a hole in the dress and it was too late to get a replacement for the event. I would buy again."
3.0,Didn't fit right at all. Too large and the return through Amazon is an extraordinary hassle.
3.0,"Russell products are to large unless you are over 6 something tall. It does not specify that items are for tall people. I was very disappointed when I tried on for the first time. Review your product and mention the length, inseam so people will know if they fit."
3.0,A bit big for the suggested waist size.
3.0,They seem to thin out and begin tearing rather quick
3.0,I love the cut of this dress! It looks great on. I received a lot of compliments. I don’t have the best confidence in how it will hold up long term. I think it will shrink (A LOT)in the dryer. But for the cost that’s okay.
3.0,very nice shoe seems like it will last but my daughter says that it's uncomfortable.
3.0,Not the fit and color they show in the picture.
3.0,Too big for the most part.  Has to be tucked to fit in a flattering way.  Is great for those well endowed in the chest as it is loose enough not to pull and be uncomfortable.
3.0,"Perfectly acceptable for the price ($.01+$8.99 shipping) and as expected. Exactly what I need for what I wanted them for (bare foot protection inside the house when needed). They are easy on and easy off. A little too easy: they stretched out really quickly and are a little sloppy, but serviceable. They work. The sole flattened and lost it's padding very quickly, as well (like, within a couple times I wore them--within the first week). I would not be happy if I'd bought these for walking outside or any distance. But I wanted them just to walk to the kitchen and back and, for that, they are working fine."
3.0,"I liked the quality of the leather , but was very disappointed when the dye color got all over my clothes'!! I would suggest that they were wiped off before they are shipped ."
3.0,I agree with all the other reviews saying the seam is way off center.. I will take it to have alteration to move mid-seam lines other wise dress is comfy and casual. I’m 5 foot 2 and 112 pounds. I got a small and it fits great. Not tight at all.
3.0,"Very nice material and are comfortable. My only complaint is that each top has mom, dad, or kid on it which is nice, but don’t offer adult sizes with kids written on it. I’ll take a top with no title on it but it’s not offered. I contacted the company last month and have yet heard anything from them."
3.0,I  expected more considering the price.  The opal is pretty but the filigree silver was very thin and uninspiring.  I wanted to see more detail as these look cheap to my eye.
3.0,I took a large that usually would fit me. I did manage to get in it and it did stretch but with the lightest stretch even without wearing it there comes a sound of a fabric tearing. I put it on and I did easily but it just wasnt complimentary it was average below average it did not snug as I wanted it to and the collar of the top is weird. I do like the color it is a pretty shade of pink.
3.0,"I liked how thin the material is on these- close to leggings, but they’re actual pants! The material is very cheap though, and started pilling within the first few wears, and also all the elastic fibers are showing at all the seems- my boyfriend said it looked like hairs coming out of the pants! These should have been about $10 pants."
3.0,"I own a few pairs of wood/bamboo sunglasses, I love that they are lightweight and don't hurt my ears, we have a boat so the fact that they float is an extra added bonus. I also ordered a pair of these for my husband because he likes my wood sunglasses so much and is always commandeering them. However, I am only giving these 3 stars because within 2 minutes of unpacking these and trying them on they gave me two deep splinters in my thumb! I noticed they kept grabbing my hair and when I ran my thumb over to see what it was it stuck me. The lenses aren't dark, which you can see in their image however the lenses on my husbands which are the light tan with blue are also quite a bit smaller than mine."
3.0,"I bought this for a trip my husband and I were going on this summer. It was adorable! The material is lightweight and I was surprised how easy it was to wear in the hot, summer temperatures. Negatives are it’s a slightly awkward fit. I wasn’t entirely sure where on my waist the elastic was to rest:higher or lower? I shuffled it around during the day as I felt like it. Also, I tend to be on the taller end of the height spectrum (about 5 foot 8 inches) and it was a little short waisted for me. I’d have done better with about 1/2 - 1 inch more for my height. For tall people just keep that in mind! Lastly, line-dry this item after washing! I accidentally put it through the dryer and it shrunk a little. I’m still wearing it despite those hurdles. This is a great trendy item which will probably only last one season, but it’s inexpensive enough to feel good about purchasing it!"
3.0,This WAS my favorite dress!  I loved everything about it until I wore it to a sweaty jazz club. The fabric does not breathe and the dye ran TERRIBLY!  I can no longer wear it and it was such a favorite of mine.
3.0,Not high quality.
3.0,Good shirt a bit see through and it came with a hole on the sleeve
3.0,somewhat small for someone around my size
3.0,"A beanie playing music has come a long way. My brother had one that used and aux cord and I had to try out the Bluetooth one. For a $13 investment, it basically went useless to me because I simply have a smaller head (size 7 in hats) and since my head was too small, the beanie looked funny and didn't look stylish at all on my head. But I did test the sound quality and personally, I think It's not the best. I do look for things that are clean and crisp while having a little more bass than normal. The drivers in the beanie are small because they're trying to make it comfortable and discreet. Ultimately, I gave it to my sister who has a bigger head than me and it fits her perfectly. She doesn't wear hats so I can't give a comparison but she loves the sounds it produces and it looks stylish on her. Overall, if you are big on how your music sounds, I wouldn't recommend it because it wasn't up to my standards. But if your just looking for a discreed way of listneing to music, then try these out. Thses  are just my personal opinions and your opinions might be different."
3.0,For the price thought I was getting two. The one I got was ok.
3.0,cheaply made for the price doubt they hold up long.
3.0,Super wrinkled and pretty large but not in a cool loose top kind of way. I probably just got the wrong size but it just doesn't look quite like the picture.
3.0,Very pretty but the style is not cold shoulder but just a spaghetti strap style. Material is nice but thin so is a little see thru. I usually wear a medium for shirts but the bust on this is a little tight.
3.0,"Pros:<br />1. They will DEFINITELY keep your hands toasty.<br />2. Sizing was great for my small hands.<br />3. Flexible enough for some dexterity.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Gloves are much thicker than they look.<br />2. Touchscreen was hit or miss when I tested it.<br /><br />I think it's good value for the price. Unfortunately, not what I was specifically looking for, so I'm returning them."
3.0,I think it would have been cute but too big. I'm 5'2 105 lbs it was ok around the chest but the waist and skirt were too big. Have to return.
3.0,The salvadorian logo is way too small but still like the mask and wear it all the time
3.0,Very snug fitting.  Size up!
3.0,A bit large and uncomfortable for a woman. Nicely design
3.0,Not bad but  somewhat unconfortable
3.0,They are too small for my face.<br />I gave them to my little brother (He's 8) and they fit him really nicely.
3.0,Absolutely love these flops but .... one of the straps broke. They have been glued together 2 times. I don't understand how they broke as I was just walking in the yard.  I would have thought for the cost they would be sturdier.
3.0,"Nice belt, I ordered a size 34, I'm a 32 and the belt is too small"
3.0,"Nice fitting, however, the plastic tag is attached on the left  hip area and is very annoying. I tried to remove it but I'm afraid that it will tear open the stitch."
3.0,Ears are super cute. The tail is very short.
3.0,I like it if it locked completely. I'm going to lose it before I have it 24 hours.
3.0,Navy blue is almost black
3.0,the straps are slightly larger/more broad than expect so slides off should if don't have broad shoulders
3.0,"Like a lot of small hoop earrings, these are hard for me to fasten. Maybe better for younger folks, and 58 isn’t old, but my fingers don’t work the clasp well.<br />Size is nice. Bigger than I’d wear for a 2nd hole but good for the main earring. They hang slightly below the ear lobe. And the twisted pattern makes them look dressy, for anyone wanting more than a plain thin hoop."
3.0,"Helps relieve leg pain during my nursing shifts, but got a holes in the toes after only a few times wearing them."
3.0,"They are fuzzy socks, I'm not surprised they fit on the small side.  Apparently fuzzy socks are made for women with tiny feet or ridiculously large feet, there really isn't an in between."
3.0,"Sleeves are super short so if you have longer arms like I do its a no go. Also, it's a little short as well. I am 5'10&#34; so I have longer arms and a longer torso. Just not a comfortable fit for my body shape."
3.0,just measure your bags the right way!
3.0,Beautil but the size too small
3.0,"IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE CHAIN IS WAY TOO SMALL, CHOKER IS A UNDERSTATEMENT"
3.0,"I've taken to wearing this watch daily, but I notice I still rely on my mobile phone for checking the time.  When I remember I have a watch on, I've noticed it has kept time accurately.  The date window has a little magnification bubble in the crystal, but I think it could be better placed, or maybe sized differently, as I still have difficulty reading the date , regardless of the magnification bubble.  Getting this to fit my wrist correctly involved a little trial and error.  First, the hasps (there are 2) on the receiving side must be fully open (the instructions included tell you how to do this).  The hard part is finding the little groove where the slide fits and allows a lock.  My trick was to place on a flat surface, slowly slide until you find the groove by feel, and then lock down (it took me 3 adjustments to figure this out). A small toolkit is provided to aid in the fit adjustment. Now that my watch is properly fitted, it feels nice - lightweight and unobtrusive.  The design is elegant and not ostentatious.  The silver color is clean and simple.  I like it - but I think making a slight adjustment to the crystal would make it better."
3.0,Was this supposed to be just one piece or two?...I just got the sweat shirt.
3.0,Hurts a little going in.
3.0,I just want to say it has been since April 3rd and I still don't have this. I have no idea what it looks like yet  but it is taking so long I may never order from this again. If it comes in and is super cute and isn't cheap looking...maybe. I will be back to post another review when I get it.
3.0,Wrist bands are fine...head bands a little bit tight.
3.0,Bought the XL with the hope that it’d be a little loose. No such luck.
3.0,Cute but it wears half size small! Which is why I’m returning
3.0,beautiful print however shrunk after washing a little to much
3.0,Very good quality...just small
3.0,Besutiful. Outfit but needed 3x
3.0,Cap looked small however recipient lives in Alaska so I don't know yet
3.0,"It's very cute and well made but I wish they would make it with a taller and slimmer cup so that more of your glasses are protected.  The cup is too short and wider than it needs to be so it only covers one lens and the glasses can &#34;flop&#34; around and needs to lean on the animal for support. Otherwise, it's super cute and nice quality and sits on my desk and makes me smile."
3.0,Too tight on the waist good on the legs
3.0,"I liked the earrings; however, a pair was  broken."
3.0,"Ive gotten several compliments on this earring, but if I wear it for a long period of time my ear starts to hurt!"
3.0,Setting the time and date was difficult
3.0,"Wish I knew they fit somewhat small, as I needed a bigger size. Comfortable though!"
3.0,"Cute dress, but for me this was too young looking babydollish (like someone in high school or college would wear)."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this because of the beautiful color effect. But it is just so wide. If it tapered, it would be an awesome band for females. Didn't have trouble getting it on though, like some others did."
3.0,"Nice masks but don't like the shiny outer material. They fit great, just wish it was a cotton outer material instead. I had previously purchased a 4- pack and thought these were the same material but they were not."
3.0,"At 160 lbs, wearing a 36C and size 8, the blouse is tight in the chest area I purchased a Large based on the size chart measurements, and while it fit, it was definitely “fitted”. Size up if you wear anything over a B cup. Returning for an XL. Otherwise the top is girly and elegant with decent quality."
3.0,I love these earrings! But they have already started to tarnish. You get what you pay for
3.0,"Has metal rings on straps to adjust, prefer plastic for children. Sun will make hot."
3.0,"The necklace seems like an okay quality. The actual state pendant is very shiny, almost like a mirror. The way it looks in pictures on amazon makes it look more matte, which is not the case. It’s a decent length, not too tight or too long."
3.0,Too difficult to pull on
3.0,"I like the material and design,  but the size is smaller than normal."
3.0,I thought it was gonna have the quarter sleeves like the first picture I had originally seen and clicked on but it’s ok. But it’s absolutely beautiful! I tried it on yesterday and wore it for about 30 mins and it’s so comfortable! I absolutely love the pockets!!! And I’m 5’2 and 131 pounds. It comes a little below my feet but it’s still perfect!
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, but very small in the hips.  Basically if you have any hips at all it will be tight fitting."
3.0,"The durability of the product is to expected, however it runs in a size much more appropriate for youths. Very cute, but I wish I could have worn them, myself."
3.0,Bottoms are a good fit but top is too small....
3.0,"I hope you all are aware that this is knockoffs of a realLele Sadoughi lily earrings that run for almost $200. You get what you pay for. To the ladies who received compliments, it’s probably because people thought you wear the real deal."
3.0,"Smaller than I thought it would be and I have a short torso, no real stretch to this material. It looks nice but I would’ve been better off going a size up!"
3.0,I bought a 2T-4T for my six month old and had to return it. It was so tight and small… it was the width of one of my hands.. oddly small. I did try to stretch it but it would of been too small still.. he has a normal size head lol I don’t  know if I got a bad one or if they all run small but I would recommend sizing up …
3.0,"Feb. 2017 Update -- Updated from 5 starts to 3 starts.  The credit card pocket lining ripped about two months ago.  I still like the rest of the purse very much but during daily use, I still accidentally use the card pocket with the ripped lining and then think I've misplaced my credit card.  I want to love this purse but the quality of the craftsmanship is what I feared -- average of a cheap knockoff at best.  I'll be looking for a replacement with higher quality lining/craftsmanship.<br /><br />Original Review -- I was worried about the reasonable price vs. the claim of genuine leather. However I've had my clutch for a few months now, have used it every day and really, really like it.  I love the camel color and it is genuine leather (although a lower quality leather).  The lining is very thin and I'm worried the pockets won't hold up well, but so far so good.  If the lining becomes an issue, I'll update the review.  Overall, I'm very pleased for the price, the functionality, and the looks of the clutch!  I get compliments about once a week and a colleague even purchased the exact same purse for his wife's birthday."
3.0,The velcro is not string enough to hold .<br />Keep getting open.
3.0,"I really loved this ring and for $10 it was a deal, unfortunately as I was attempting to remove it to bake some cookies it broke right in half"
3.0,"These are the weirdest pants I've ever seen. My son has trouble with buttons and after a certain size, designers replace snaps with buttons. These were the compromise-pull on  jeans. They are really long and the waist is huge. Plus, there is so much space in the abdominal area it's almost like little maternity pants. My son didn't want to return them because he doesn't want to use his jeans with the button, and he hides the Poofy front with his shirt."
3.0,I found this needed repair right out of the package. Unfortunately waited too long to return and I’ll need to mend it. Aside from that ok.
3.0,I'm old ... not soft enough.
3.0,It's OK.  My wife says it makes the handles too sticky.  I'm more concerned with how well it keeps them in tact.
3.0,First I want to say how beautiful this tunic is. A very simple A line dress with wonderful hanging grape lace trim. For this I gave it 3 stars. Then there is the fact I ordered it 2 sizes too big and it is still tight across the shoulders and the upper arms. It is shear but great as a tunic style top to wear with leggings and a camisol or as a swimsuit cover up
3.0,The men’s swim shorts run a little small. I did not like the bottoms of the bikini. If you have hips it is a no go for sure .
3.0,Like the look but to big for women face
3.0,Clasp is very difficult to ensure it is secure. No luminescence on face or the watch arms as advertised. Very difficult to read.
3.0,"The watch itself looks nice and is lightweight. The downside is that the band has stitching on the inside that rubs against your wrist and as a result, it's quite itchy to wear."
3.0,It’s stiff and impractical
3.0,Very cheap and cheezy but LOVELY looking. Purchased it for an Indian girl costume and it worked perfectly!
3.0,The idea for this bag is awesome  but the quality is not. It is a decent size but the stamping of the picture is crooked and looks rushed.
3.0,I like the shirt but it's super small !
3.0,NOT TOO BAD
3.0,"It was a bit heavy for being titanium.  I have titanium watches and this band may have some titanium in the metal, but it can’t be a lot.  Ended up returning the band."
3.0,"Its good for men not for boys, need to change the title I bought this for my son but he can't wear it it's too big for him,  other than that it's good watch."
3.0,I did not know the band was going to be  so big wish there was a smaller one. I don't have. Big wrist.
3.0,"Okay, wish it was adjustable. Can't wear it."
3.0,Tangled too easily and also too yellowish in color.
3.0,Much smaller than they look
3.0,A good layered up necklace nothing great nothing bad
3.0,Fits great. Small flaw in stitching in hem. Material is thin so definitely need a slip worn underneath.
3.0,If you want a necklace you can change the stone frequently this is not for you.  I did not realize you actually have to bend the necklace to put the stone in then you have to bend it back into place.  Do this a few times and it will snap off.  The better option would be to use the fabric pompoms instead of lava stones.<br />I will say they are pretty and a bang for your buck.
3.0,"It's an okay product. The outfit is cute itself and looked adorable on my daughter. The headband came broken with the pendant off and the shoulder strap tore as my daughter was taking it off. It was even a little big but because the material had no give, it tore."
3.0,Cool pocket clip for my keys. Use it to connect to different key rings. Have received a few compliments on it.
3.0,The band snaps are of poor quality and will easily unhook if you bump it. The shipping was faster than except though.
3.0,"Love the size and look of these, they have sharp edges though"
3.0,"These are great things, except they are lighter weight and flimsier than i want them to be.<br /><br />Edited to add - I have used these 2-3 times each, and the handles of 2 are tearing off.  They have not been overloaded, mostly very light loads.  I said as soon as I purchased that they were flimsy.  They are VERY flimsy."
3.0,Fits to small around the bottom
3.0,"These shirts are very high quality for the price. On quality alone, I'd give a 5 star review. The colors are very true to the photos  and the coverage is very good while still showing what you want to show in a racerback tank. They are VERY fitted though. I'm 5'1"" and 135lbs and usually wear a small when I want something fitted, so I ordered these in a medium. They are so fitted I wouldn't be comfortable wearing them outside of the house. They do fit great, and they feel good on, but I can't say they are flattering in the least unless you have a very, very athletic build with a totally flat/toned stomach. I also don't love the fabric. The listing IS clear that it is a polyester/spandex blend so I should have realized what I was buying, but it doesn't feel like a material that will wick sweat at all. If you want a very fitted tank and are ok with a silky polyester/spandex blend, buy these. They weren't for me though."
3.0,I was expecting it to be a little bigger. But looks cool in my man cave.
3.0,"I ordered two costumes and this is the one I didn't chose.  It is a very flowy cape, lightweight, nicely marked.  There is no mask or hood.  I wear a 2X and this is a bit small but would probably do if you wear black underneath.  If you aren't too excited about dressing up for a Holloween party and don't want to spend a lot of money, this would probably fit the bill.  BTW the custume I'm wearing is the nun custume also from Amazon.  It fits well and for a few more dollars is a much better quality."
3.0,"I wish that I had read the reviews more carefully as several pointed out that it is shorter than expected.  Judging by the picture of the model I thought this would be long enough to cover my behind but it is very short in the back.  I ordered a 3x to make sure it was large enough and it falls just at the top of my behind, but is longer in the front.  If I would have realized this I probably wouldn't have ordered it.  Also, the material is very thin, it is described as a cardigan, but the material is like very soft very thin t-shirt material and I expected it to be thicker since I think of a cardigan as a sweater type material.  It is a cute design though."
3.0,They are comfortable but provide no support.  I was looking for new underwear because they no longer make the one I have bought for years.  Would not buy these again.
3.0,It is nice. I think it does not provide the clearest view. It fits well and looks original.
3.0,Hats are to small. Otherwise they are cute
3.0,We’ve had Edea skates almost since he started skating. We love the skates but the laces constantly need to be replaced so keep a few pairs on hand. We swap them out about every 2-3 months. He skates 18-20 hours a week. They seem to stretch out and cause him to constantly re-tie them.
3.0,Pattern is paper not tissue
3.0,Seem like decent quality but were about a size smaller than listed.
3.0,"The straps are some how too big, mind you it’s a size small. It should be tight around the stomach area, not loose."
3.0,"Fits well everywhere,  but if you have a bigger chest,  may want to compare sizes carefully."
3.0,I wish they had an XXL. I wear an XL but I would have ordered an XXL if that was a choice because I know with some of these t's they run small.  Sad that I can't wear it.
3.0,It’s doable but won’t buy again.
3.0,"It feels and fits very comfortably, however it seems they tried to ""improve"" the pockets by sewing them shut in the middle. Maybe in  an attempt to prevent items from falling out, but this results in being unable to insert your hands inside and having to dig in there awkwardly to get items out."
3.0,"Like the top super cute. It does loosen a lot so you must retie the strings often but looks awesome. My first one came with no liner in breast, but it should have it so I returned and reordered with no problem."
3.0,The face is much bigger that it looks.
3.0,"I would love them thinner, so I won't look like a senior citizen no offense to the elderly."
3.0,I love funky fashion glasses but these appeared entirely too cheap upon purchase. Have to my kid sister instead.
3.0,I little big on my head and I wish it had buttons on the side for your mask. Other than that super cute especially for my pediatric patients!
3.0,I really love the sweater and color but it started to pill where the material runs under your arms after 3 wears.
3.0,They are a bit big they slide down and I feel I am always tugging them up. They are a nice soft fabric but not the tummy control I thought they would be
3.0,"This was a bit big and I could go down two sizes to a M. I wasn't fond of the two straps on the back, but the cover up was cute!"
3.0,"I’m like so confused about these. They’re either knock offs or total rejects that got manufactured wrong.  I’m about a B cup but a 32, if I wear a 34 no matter what size the cup, straps are always falling off. All that to say, last year in Dillard’s I was fitted for these and somehow I was a 32D. Whatever. They worked forever. Then I had a 32c that fit better. So I have now ordered a 32C from here which I couldn’t even clasp and my boobs were spilling over (I have very small breasts) so then I ordered a 32D and my breasts barely fit in the cups. Like wtf is going on?!"
3.0,too small in the arm
3.0,"As others have said, the fabric on this dress is nice and thick.  I usually wear a small but got a medium based on the reviews.  It's very form fitting - too snug around the torso for me.  I felt like it was squeezing me, like a corset; I couldn't go up a size because the sleeves were already too long for me.  If it weren't so tight, I think it'd be a cute dress, but I couldn't wear it comfortably, so back it goes."
3.0,Dress was wet when I opened it
3.0,"Looks better in photo, cheap looking"
3.0,The pendant is quite large.  Didn't realize it was going to be that big.  Might be too large for my 6 year old niece.
3.0,"The shirt has a strange fit. The neck is loose and kind of sticks out. Does not lay flat. The shirt is more wide, than it is long. The graphic lettering is just plastic looking. Not a shirt I would wear in public. Just something to wear at home while baking or cleaning."
3.0,"Gifted person review: Ordered regular size M. Was expecting a short top that cinched at the waist like the photos. To top is boxing, made a big circle around my waist & I don't have a great waist. Sleeves are nice. The shorts were a bit loose on me but I have skinny legs. Comfy stretch waist. Soft material, great deep wine color. Looks more like a cotton blend.<br />If not for the boxy top would have been cute."
3.0,They're cool for what they are. They seem to bulge out more on my ears but I still like them. Wish they had the rubber part around the circumference to give a more authentic look but I like them and they have fallen apart on me.
3.0,Zips from the opposite side as I would have expected down graded because of that only
3.0,Top portion fix to tight bottom portion of the dress fit ok
3.0,"The earrings are lovely, yet understated. Blue color of the stones was much darker than in photo, almost black, and did not reflect the light as much as I would have liked. There is a new tendency to place the posts of the back of the earring either at the top of the circular part or at the bottom, which i find irritating, as to me that implies cheaply made. Had I known about the difference in color, I would not have purchased these."
3.0,Much smaller than expected. Would help if product dimensions were posted.
3.0,"It was cute in theory, however it was a little smaller than i expected and the material felt weird. Returned it right away."
3.0,Not very reflective.
3.0,Good but slightly large in the leg holes. Tends to ride up a lot.
3.0,"Very nice and was a great birthday present. However the globe itself is sort of cheep. More plasticish than metallic, which was what I was expecting. still very beautiful."
3.0,They are nice quality but very thick and nearly impossible to put on a wiggly two year old.
3.0,Very tight in the arms and has lots of static.
3.0,But cute
3.0,Works well. Would have given it 5 stars if the Samsung headphone fit thru the hole or if it had some sort of adapter
3.0,Not as colored
3.0,Still getting used to socks that have a hole for each toe a bit hard to get used to and to get on your feet but I bought them for Pilates class
3.0,I returned this dress. It was cute but just didn't work for me. Way too short on me too :(
3.0,"As in the headline, the glasses are comfortable, the lens are large and great for reading, I will note they seem more fragile  than some I've bought due to the plastic frames and one set's frame has broken and lost a lens."
3.0,I may have to order a smaller one
3.0,Definitely need to go up a size
3.0,my wife told me it's not that good.
3.0,"I don't see myself wearing this much. Sterling silver and I don't get along well. Another entry in the ""Should have read it before I ordered it"" book.<br /><br />That and it's lifted from the ""Witcher"" series. Slapping a ""rune"" on jewelry doesn't make it Viking.<br /><br />Still, it's an attractive piece to look at."
3.0,"The photo is misleading<br />This set is very nice, but it's not made for adults. It's tiny.<br />I orginially bought it for me to wear to a gala with my daughter, but it is so small. I let her wear it instead.<br />It fits perfectly on my 4 year old daughter."
3.0,"I am kind of disappointed in this necklace.  It doesn't look like the picture at all.  It is more of a gold yellow, and just doesn't look like what I hoped it would.  I was hoping for an antique type look, but it looks more like molded plastic."
3.0,Liked but runs small
3.0,nothing exceptional
3.0,"Very comfy, i normally wear large and the medium fit great. I hace a small waist and big hips and rhe dress wasnt fitted so it went straight to my hips and i looked like a brick. I returned it, but would have kept it if my body didnt look so weird in it!"
3.0,"I bought these along with Yogalicious brand; mostly for the leg pocket to hold my phone while running + I'm a yoga teacher. I'm 5' tall about 117 lbs and often have trouble finding good sizes because I'm short AND have hips. So first, the ""cropped"" fits almost down to regular pant size for me (as expected, and actually fine for my purposes). Overall the same size in this brand is looser than the Yogalicious, but not necessarily more comfortable. In fact the crotch area in front just.feels.weird, even when the pants are pulled up high above my navel. Just this shortie's experience but I found a review for a short woman helpful on another product so thought I'd add this one."
3.0,"The bikini brief style & colors are nice. Price ok. But don't have a good and firm elasticity by the butt. I choose the right size , but they dont made it right. Is very important to made you feel tight and comfortable.  The waist have a great elasticity why the legs don't ?"
3.0,"The color of the lilac crop top is true to the picture, and the material feels cool and silky. Unfortunately the smallest size was too big and stretchy, especially at the sleeves. However, it wouldn't necessarily look bad worn despite it being unfitted. I would definitely suggest pairing the top with a flowy skirt as opposed to skin tight pants."
3.0,The rings did not fit but I love shopping here
3.0,These were too thin so I returned them. If you are looking for that then this would be perfect for you. Personally I was looking for something thicker
3.0,The fit is a little big. The length shrunk after I washed it so that's disappointing.
3.0,"fabric is semi-sheer so expect to wear a tank top and shorts under the dress. Lightweight, comfortable, and perfect for summer other than the opacity."
3.0,They made my vision feel weird and had to return them.
3.0,Fits better than the other tights I bought from you. But it is still a little bit too large
3.0,"Nice looking water shoe. Does not fit true to size, however. They ran a bit small for my son, and as a result, they are difficult to get on and off. Will be returning for a larger size, as we quite like the shoes though."
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, 146lbs and 38DD. I ordered the XL after reading reviews because I was concerned with the bottoms. The top fits bigger breast great! The bottoms look and feel like a small! They are horrible!"
3.0,"The necklace is easily tangled when wearing it, the two chains roll together. Otherwise its a nice simple necklace."
3.0,"I bought this because I needed a super suit for a competition and the design was perfect! I gave it 3 stars because I had 3 issues:<br />1: It's not black, it's more of an off block or charcoal gray<br />2: THERE'S NO BLING!!! The pic of the girl had me thinking the suit was blinged out. I did not pay attention to the mannuquin where it shows no bling,  but you see the little circles. Please be aware that YOU HAVE TO STONE THIS GARMENT if you want it to look pretty. There A LOT of those little circles which won't look right if you don't cover each one!<br />3. THIS JUMPSUIT RUNS BIG! I'm a med. so a small usually makes me look like Baby Huey. I bought the medium and had to exchange it for the small because the medium was a little baggy. I got the small and it's a perfect fit ""right now"", but I might still have to take it in if I lose 5lbs.<br />If you like this jumpsuit GO DOWN ONE SIZE and BE READY TO ADD STONES!"
3.0,"Maybe these would look better on someone else, but they made me look like a futuristic alien."
3.0,I bought both sizes of this product that the sizes are just too drastic. There isn’t a happy medium (pub intended).
3.0,"Wow, It took two strong people to struggle to get this compressed pillow out of the bag.  It took about 8 hours for it to expand to full size.  I was hoping for a really dense firm pillow to support my neck.  I would consider this pillow to be of medium support.  My kitty loves to sleep on it.  I use it as the background pillow which feels wonderful and sleep on an extra firm Polly filled pillow for the support I need.  Well constructed."
3.0,Not the color I thought and a little clunky feeling compared to the apple one - but otherwise great.
3.0,"Ok so first thing was when I opened the package this dress had an absolutely horrible smell, I mean horrible. Had to immediately place back in bag to get away from the smell. After some consideration I decided to wash this dress right away and see if smell resolved. After washing product twice smell has resolved and I was able to try dress on. Fit was nice. Material is stretchy and thin. Will need to wear some shapewear under to prevent appearance of unpleasant lines and bulges. Overall nice appearing dress if you can get past the initial smell of the fabric."
3.0,"I don't like the color. It is beige, totally different."
3.0,The sleeve lining separates from the knit pink knitting of the mitten.
3.0,"I like the pattern, fit & such-but sadly-no pocket...."
3.0,It was cheaper looking than I thought it would be.
3.0,"Very pretty dress, not see through. I'm 5'8"", 190 pounds. I ordered a large and it was just a little too tight. I should have ordered an XL. Even if it's a little loose, I could shrink it in the wash. Ordered a different design as they were out of the XL."
3.0,I  have a bigger head than the average person so if this is you I wouldnt recommend it. The adjustment of the speakers is not that easy. you have to unzip and move around the speaker with velcro and try to guess where it would feel best. Overall I wouldn't recommend. Also for working out this thing does not breath at all so its a terrible idea unless you don't sweat.
3.0,super tight
3.0,It’s very soft but runs small
3.0,"The apron itself is great. Water proof and covers almost your entire body. However, it is dangerously long on most people under 5'8"", so be aware that you may need to hem the bottom so there is no trip hazard."
3.0,"These slippers are a touch large and not as fuzzy as others I've had, but on the whole are warm and comfortable to wear around the house. They do not have a firm sole, however, so can't be allowed outside, and even the garage is pushing it. My biggest complaint is their lack of durability. After about 3 months the fabric started to wear through in spots, and now a month and a half later, the holes are huge and inner soles are falling out. You can't expect them to last even a full winter season. I'll be looking for a different slipper to replace these."
3.0,The vest was great as far as material quality but the heating elements only worked for about an hour on a full battery charge. I am hoping that they can come out with a more productive battery as the vest is quite nice. Runs a bit on the small size so if you are a large order up one size.
3.0,"It's cute, but one of the snaps tore out of the leg fabric the first time we put it on! Definitely a one-time-use outfit."
3.0,"Would be a good suit if your butt and boobs are a similar size. The suit fit the bottoms, but was huge on the top. Otherwise, it's just like the picture. Nice quality."
3.0,These are very cheap. The buttons do not stay together because the holes for the are too big. I was in public walking and didn’t realize my whole left side was on display.
3.0,"Poor design.<br />By the time you put pencils and pens in each elastic loop, there's not much room in the inside compartment.<br /><br />You lose the amount of space the pencils take up.<br /><br />I'd love it if there were more room.<br />I keep pencils, fountain pens and brushes in the pencil case elastic loops, and watercolor supplies in the big compartment.<br /><br />If it had just a little more height inside the main compartment, it would make a perfect art travel kit.<br /><br />As it is now, I can't put all I want in it for a full travel watercolor/mixed media kit.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a nice case.<br /><br />If you don't need that extra space, I don't think you'd be disappointed.<br /><br />It's a nice little Case."
3.0,not that nice... but okay for a once a year &#34;wear&#34;
3.0,"Love the color and design, however it fits a little bigger than expected, maybe I should've gotten a small"
3.0,"Not quite the quality I was looking for, but the colors are perfect."
3.0,"The material is quite thin. Not something I would wear to work, and feels more like a costume shirt. The buttons also feel a bit cheap, and seem to loop through the thread in addition to the buttonhole. Otherwise, it's an okay shirt."
3.0,My niece is obsessed with cats. We purchased this for her and she liked it. The material for the gloves seemed off a bit. Otherwise it was a fun present to give.
3.0,"Photo is cool, but far to small for my kids head."
3.0,"I really love the concept of this necklace. Since I am diehard Death Note fan, this was something I just HAD to have. The combination of a necklace and a watch together is really cool.<br /><br />I was happy to have received this item so quickly. The seller ""animemart"" had packaged in in a little zip-lock bag. When I opened it, I noticed that the front was scratched a lot, but not so much to be noticeable (you'd have to really look to see it). Also, the inside of the necklace seemed to have a large black border at the top of the watch part which appears to look like a gradient of some sort, as it starts to get smaller at the right side (kind of hard to explain, looks like a mess up in the painting or something). The opening to the necklace on the inside has a lot of black marks also. Basically, it does not look as good quality as it does on the preview picture on Amazon.<br /><br />Overall, the necklace is really cool, but I wish it was a little bit in better condition, although it was described as ""new"" it looked like it was used a lot, if not just handled poorly. The watch part works great and it is a stylish necklace to wear, I recommend it to any DN fan."
3.0,It's really cute but it's too small! Some of my notebooks for school don't even fit. Huge disappointment.
3.0,cute skirt but runs small size up if you can
3.0,Pay close attention to placement of stones!!!<br />Some stones look very similar when placed next to each other.
3.0,Decent gloves just very tight around my hands and I have pretty small hands. one is even tighter than the other so a little bit defective. Awesome deal for real leather but wish they were made with better quality control.
3.0,3 stars because of the fit. The top is VERY cropped and the pants were pretty baggy with them being joggers of a sort. I like the color though and it is comfy. I got size L I usually go M
3.0,"Cute, but the material is super weird and scratchy, and it was a little too big but I guess that's my fault"
3.0,"looks alright. fabric isn't very good quality- it is quite rough and itchy. I was expecting a light, soft cotton blend."
3.0,Super cute! But was way too big for my wrist!
3.0,good delivery. product okay.  had one of these for many years from a jeweler and simply wore it out.  this one doesn't seem to clean or polish as nicely but it works.
3.0,The zipper broke the first time I used it.
3.0,I thought it was going to be flannel. It was cotton.
3.0,It is a very nice outfit. Not exact fit but lovely color.
3.0,"These have the consistency of Crocs. They are cute however if I didn't get them for as cheap as I did, I would have been very disappointed for the price when I could get Crocs for a fraction of the cost of Birkenstock's."
3.0,"This was a gift for my 81 yr old mother for Mother's Day.  I personally liked it!  My mother did not.  1st, I got it in her size, but it was waaay too big.  I told her that I'd exchange it and get a smaller one. Then she added, ""I'm sorry, but I also don't like the color and style.  She did like the fact that it came with a soft lining which was  removable.  Ya win some, ya lose some!  I still love my Amazon though!  😉"
3.0,"This buckle looks good & was a great gift for a friend, he loved it. Even tho the ribbon makes it look girly"
3.0,"The jeans seem like quality jeans - but they are WAY TOO SMALL.  I even ordered a size larger than I normally would, but they still don't fit.  Life of a big hipped girl I guess.  Just order a few sizes larger to ensure they fit!"
3.0,"They were very inexpensive so I'm keeping them. I get lots of compliments, perhaps because they are so bright, but they're 'baggy' on my feet, way too wide."
3.0,"It was a bit tight, the glitter made a mess, zipper was stiff, the fabric felt I uncomfortable. Overall it was okay and can be worn but it wasn’t for me."
3.0,"We have always bought genuine leather boots, but because our daughter has been growing through sizes so quickly, we wanted to try a cheaper alternative. Although we knew the quality would not be that of leather, we were hoping for something more close. The bottoms were a seemingly inexpensive plastic (and we know that wears so easily). Also, the seams were lined with a plastic material that just doesn't hold up well. I will say that we could've been pleasantly surprised with the quality, but we did choose to return these and purchase real leather ones."
3.0,I am happy with the product except it was about a quarter inch too large for my Wallet. When ordering be careful to check measurements as apparently all hipster wallets aren't the same size.
3.0,"These are not bad, they're very much the sort of thing that are &#34;in&#34; recently. I thought they would make a great birthday gift for my brother in law, since they said they're for men, but when I opened them I realized they basically fit my wrist, but would never fit my BIL, who is an average sized guy at around 6'2&#34; and in good shape. I had my husband try them in after me and he could not even get them on. Nice idea and nice pattern, it's just too bad they are not bigger so men could actually wear them. Or change the description to unisex.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product for free or on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

3.0,The dress was ok. I didn’t like the style on me. Product was good quality. Wasn’t what I was looking for. Great was good except I didn’t care for the hem.
3.0,"much smaller than anticipated, and arrived 2 weeks later than estimated."
3.0,"The bathing suit is good quality for the price and the print is just as pictured. However, the top is a bit akward and I am having to have fabric removed so the breast part isnt separated so far apart."
3.0,"Handles on all 3 nets broke after the first use but the kids still use it. But for the price, it works."
3.0,"Dress is cute & sequins under arms don’t bother the arms, they’re laid in flat.  However, disappointed that it didn’t come with the wand & crown as stated in the description"
3.0,"This loupe is very compact and light weight.  I don't believe it is actually a 30x magnification, but for the money I wouldn't expect it to be.  I do find it useful to take with me to examine coins I am interested in."
3.0,"I'm pleased with this suit. The top needed to be adjusted to fit right... It does look different from the pictures but not too much. The built in bra is extra padded, it feels really firm and shows a lot more cleavage than I expected. It's still cute."
3.0,"The color was good as well as the material. The size was larger in every area,"
3.0,"It looks like the pictures. That is about all I can say about the watch. It was so unique I wanted it. I collect pocket watches. I have Old and very expensive ones, and what I like to call daily run abouts. It runs slow and fast. 5 minutes either way. I still like it. Yes I carry it."
3.0,I did not like that these are very small! More for a child’s ear! Price is ok! I can’t use the rings they are way to small!
3.0,"Smaller than I thought they would be. I got 2 blacks and a blue, no white. It’ll work. Too much of a hassle to return. Would not order again."
3.0,I have a very chubby baby so maybe that's my problem. They seem to fit around his legs just fine but he can kick them off so easy. The Velcro is nice but doesn't allow you to adjust for sizing. I think if your baby has skinny legs these would be even harder to keep on their feet.
3.0,she loved it was a perfect match for the costume
3.0,"Look great, but they never delivered."
3.0,This set of shirts was about two sizes below what the recommend size should've been. The material felt soft to the touch but unfortunately I donated the shirts to Goodwill because they were way too small and not worth the effort to ship back.
3.0,I love the color and beauty of these stones.  It's seems they did break although they were wrapped really well. So I am disappointed that the black kyanite is broke because you receive only 3 piece out of the 10 anyways. I really do love theses stones through.
3.0,"For me, this is an expensive pair of socks, so I expect a lot.  First, I'm female, size 9.5 shoe...women's socks are often too small after washing and drying, so for anklets, I usually purchase men's.  I'm on the hunt for a very lightweight, moisture wicking sock that can be washed in the sink and hung to dry overnight or less for an upcoming trip to southeast Asia where conditions will be hot and humid.  I only want to take a few pair for the entire two weeks as I am traveling with only a small pack and no luggage.<br /><br />I like the fit although I found them a little tight right at the ankle elastic...but not a deal breaker.  I like the colors (I bought a pair in black and a pair in the dark blue...don't want lighter as they may be stained with daily dirt through my Keens).  They are comfortable.  After wearing them all day with my sneakers in 95 degree weather, I can say that they seemed drier than my all-cotton athletic anklets.  At the end of the day, I washed them in the bathroom sink with some liquid soap, wrung them out hard and left them to dry.  It was nearly 80 degrees in the house, and the bathroom window was open all night for ventilation.  In the morning, they were just as wet as they were the night before.  If I had clothes pins and a line and could dry them right in the window, I might have fared better.  But I wanted to simulate proximity to the travel conditions I would be facing.  So for the drying time alone, and the price, they didn't meet my need and I won't purchase more for my trip.  I'll have to keep hunting for actual quick-dry, which I think is going to be most likely found in an all synthetic material.  Hubby is looking for me...he has hunting socks that dry faster than these and they are thicker.  I'm thinking my best option for quick dry and super lightweight will be a sock liner if I can find it in an anklet.  I can't speak to their durability as I have only worn them a single day."
3.0,I loved this too however it stains way to easily.  Even after washing it you can still see the stain mark.
3.0,Looks like dime store quality. But still has a beautiful idea. Metal casting not quality. Looks better online than in person.
3.0,This bag is not a large it's a small bag
3.0,Love the necklace but chain is more fragile than I thought
3.0,Looks good but small .
3.0,Cute tight & sexy
3.0,I dont like the was it wasnt stitched up on the inside of the strap. Everything else is okay.
3.0,It's was okay kinda  flimsy and had a draw string to pull tight on your waist. A little pricey for the quality. It was too big in places and tight in others???
3.0,Size runs small.  I can't wear a bra under it at all. Makes it pretty unwearable.
3.0,Not really happy on how it looked
3.0,Look is very deceiving.
3.0,"Though a bit cluncky and heavy, it’s a beautiful looking Rolex imitation band. For the price and look, I’d highly recommend."
3.0,Either too big or too small when looping it.
3.0,Runs a bit big but otherwise comfortable
3.0,Cute to but isn't sewn well enough.
3.0,This product was not up to my standard and i was refunded my money
3.0,Pretty but has a strange metallic smell like very cheap metal.
3.0,So I really like how these fit. But omg do not use them for running. There is a small but thick seam right between the two sides over the sternum that rubs. It actually didn’t hurt until it rubbed it raw. It’s small (4mm diameter) but super painful. I’m not someone who has issues with chafing it being irritated with running clothes even with 2hr runs. This happen twice now (5mi run and 10mi run) so these will only be weight lifting bras.
3.0,It did not fit well.
3.0,"I like the shirt, I love it under my coat for outdoor winter workouts but it runs small! I’m comparing it to another shirt I have that fits more like a regular medium should."
3.0,Didn’t like the feel of band
3.0,"Not really a 'push up'. The band on the bottom is odd and a little uncomfortable - there's an elastic 'pull-over' band, and then a latching band on top of it. Kinda uncomfortable."
3.0,"Nice boots, good quality, excellent price but not very confortable, feels a bit harsh but anyway I am satisfied with buying them."
3.0,"Faded a lot after one wash, and get very hot"
3.0,Guard on arm came off less than 30 days past the return policy. Very disappointed
3.0,"The fabric and sewing quality are top notch! Bought a size L for my 50"" 51 lb child. We were right on the edge of M/L so I went with L for growing room. Big mistake, as he was swimming in them. We are returning to try the M. The plaid is very pretty. Hope we can find a fit."
3.0,"The material is really nice and soft, and the color was as expected. However the cinched waist was very high and it was not attractive in that regard, particularly if you are busty. It is a modest dress, as the description implied. Unfortunately more modest than I would’ve preferred also. My biggest issue with it was that high waist which looked bad on me and is truly not my style."
3.0,"It's a nice all cloth mask, thick but breathable.  But it barely covered my face from the bridge of my nose to my chin. It was tight across my nose and mouth. I tried loosening the ear ties, but couldn't find a good length. The mask fell below my nose when I sang. And if it shrinks in the washer or dryer, it won't fit. I'll have to order something else. FWIW, my face measures 13"" from the back of one outer ear to the other across the bridge of my nose. I usually take a medium adult sized mask. I would need at least a large in this."
3.0,not too much of a cushion.
3.0,Size runs on the small end. Battery life really short like 2 hrs of music on a full battery.
3.0,Super cute slippers but the front of the slipper is very difficult to get your foot into. Brought these slippers for my 2 yo and it's hard for him to keep them on.
3.0,the stitching on the straps is starting to come undone. such a bummer because my daughter loves it!
3.0,"Seams are pretty fragile, one ripped as soon as I opened it. I hope they are strong enough to hold groceries. They are easy to toss in a purse or bag and have really cute patterns which is a plus"
3.0,The type of material made me overheat in the sun and they are too small.
3.0,A bit too long and needed adjustment- shorter
3.0,"Super cute style, however runs SUPER small."
3.0,Order a size up. I ordered a M which is my normal size for everything and I couldn't fit my boobs in the sweater. I had a hard time putting the sweater on and taking it off because of that reason.
3.0,"With a combination of 2 prices it costs $10. I would not pay more than $4 as it is an average boring tiny HALF globe.<br />If there is any silver, well... Make it $7. It is not ugly, can stimulate some interest in youngster in the Earth... Like a prize for to finish a semester without Cs. Not wearable for an adult (my opinion; you may decide differently).<br />If there are any money they send to a fund to save our ocean, it might be a good portion of the price. So I feel like I have a good deal:)"
3.0,This dress was so cute! I loved it! But it was a tad too big in the waist and I didn’t like how the fit made me look. It was sooo cute though! I wish I could have kept it! I bought the size 0/2 and my waist is 25in for reference.
3.0,Fits a little to big
3.0,"I got the tall by mistake even though I am 6' 4&#34;, the tail hangs below my hiney. Material is very thin."
3.0,Bien pero para mi gusto muy grueso pero bien
3.0,I returned the item as it runs very bid. I like the fabric and was very upset I had to return it. Did not reorder
3.0,"Not a bad dress, pretty color and a very stretchy material for the style. Worth the money"
3.0,Runs large and the back accent strap was seen on twisted.
3.0,"I returned these, they are pictured as gray but were light brown.  Heel was too narrow on the bottom (not inside) for me."
3.0,"The leather looks good. The strap fits perfectly but the pins don't fit,they're too short. I eventually got the old pins in. Now it works great."
3.0,"Usually I wear a large, and athletic shirts in that size fit me pretty tightly, so I purchase XL thinking they'd be a little looser. Not so in this case. When I opened them I thought I'd received the wrong size, but the tags said XL. They look like a tight medium and fit me like a second skin. I showed them to a friend and asked what size she thought they were. She said Medium. They're fine for me to wear under other workout shirts, but I didn't intend to layer them with other clothes."
3.0,The watch is what I expected - no bezzle rotation & some difficulty in reading the time on the watch but I wanted day/date & I got it.
3.0,The LED wasn’t very bright. The material felt cheap but this product was definitely on the inexpensive side so my expectations were basically met
3.0,"First of all, I want to say this is a beautiful looking bracelet. I think it makes my Luminor really shine. The manufacturing is great (with a big exception I'll talk about in a second). It's a heavy, solid bracelet; it's doesn't rattle or feel cheap. It's easy to remove the links for sizing and it comes with two half links, so you can really fine tune the sizing. It has solid end links and fits the case of the watch well. In many ways, this bracelet is as good as any OEM steel bracelet I own. It has a fantastic, expensive feel in the hands.<br /><br />So what's the problem? It's like wearing a bracelet made of thorns. For some reason, iStrap decided to leave all the edges sharp, like little knives. This is the least comfortable steel bracelet I own or have ever worn. After about an hour, my wrist is covered in welts. Why, iStrap, why? How hard would it have been to buff the edges down a little bit? I mean seriously, this is just manufacturing malpractice. A watch should not hurt to wear.<br /><br />I'm going to get this thing to a buffing wheel and see if I can fix it. iStrap, if you're reading this, take a few seconds to buff off the sharp edges off these things. If you do, you'll have a five star product."
3.0,"I am only 5'2 and I like to wear looser clothes, but it made me look bigger than i actually am. But still a nice looking dress"
3.0,"It's not what I was expecting, but it's okay.  I was thinking it would be a small metal pendant.  It's bigger than I thought it would be and it looks more like one of those chrome coated things you'd get out of a toy capsule machine; again, not bad, just not what I was expecting.  The pin holding the circle in place is bent so the circle doesn't spin on mine.<br /><br />I was afraid to wear it because I was worried the coating would start to chip off so I hung it on my review mirror instead and I'm very happy to have it there."
3.0,These are cut well but the material gives out and it thins itself out even to a smallest chafing.  Should be thicker just a but more.
3.0,Super cute but poorly made. Straps were not sewn down so I had to return.
3.0,I bought these as a birthday gift to go with white crocs however these are cream and not white 😒
3.0,"The bottom half goes on smoothly, but the straps are hard to pull over. It has boobie pads that get all folded funky as you struggle to get the straps on."
3.0,"I guess I should have gotten the large for length, cause this is short! Like crop top almost short"
3.0,"Lettering is not as dark or big as shown in picture, but the price was good and looked great. Gave as a present and she LOVED it."
3.0,This dress fits pretty well aside from the bust area. The v neck keeps opening super easy and leaves a bit to be desired as far as modesty. I’m probably going to sew a little stitch there just to help keep it closed.<br /><br />I don’t love the color as much in person. It’s quite pastel and not really my favorite.
3.0,Got this for my halloween boudoir. It fell apart 10 minutes into my photoshoot. It was super cute and I was very disappointed that it broke on me.
3.0,Nice but if you order a small you'd better be VERY small.
3.0,"This robe is actually too thick; it's bulky and stiff too. I'm hoping that washing it helps, but I don't want to use fabric softener because of wanting to keep absorbency. If it improves I'll update the review."
3.0,"These are nice and thick with a very stretchy waistband. I don't normally buy leggings, but needed them for post-hernia surgery. The top is pretty tight if you have a swollen painful belly - but still wearable. Unfortunately, after 8 wearings, the seam is already opening up between the leggings and waistband and doesn't appear to be repairable."
3.0,"Really tiny, zipper doesn't work well, and color is nowhere near as vivid as in the picture. But my granddaughter likes it."
3.0,"I bought a pair of these and liked them but they were a little large. I bought 2 more and went one size smaller and they are tight so I have to hang dry them. Other than that, I love them."
3.0,Wish the neck strap was adjustable and the ties might not last long but overall great purchase for 8 bucks!
3.0,I.was disappointed in this dress. The quality was cheap. The skirt isn't full at all. The unicorn applique was off center and looks weird.
3.0,"While very pretty, the front is heavy. We are having to use combs, Bobby pins, and elastic to keep it in place for the reception."
3.0,"Quality is good and the case is nice, but these really are huge glasses. Feel a little bit like I have bug eyes while wearing them, but they serve the purpose."
3.0,Very easy to pull off
3.0,"Like the shorts with pockets, just can't like the top, maybe should be more loose."
3.0,"I was really excited about this shirt cause it’s super cute and made with a material that’s not super soft but is comfortable! However unfortunately within the first few hours of wearing it, where the ruffle hem is in the lower half of the shirt, it started ripping. It doesn’t seem to be sewed together very well. So now I have a couple small gaps in the shirt where if I accidentally pull on it, I’ll have areas of my stomach showing :(<br />BUT great customer service, they gave me a refund and apologized and said that they would be talking with their manufacturer to prevent this from happening again."
3.0,"They're great. They are compression which my daughter isn't used to, but I've order s th see twice and there's only been ONE SET in the package. This is freaking awful scam"
3.0,Love the look but after just a few sears they began to tarnish behind the earring.
3.0,"Ordered 5/30/21 received 7/17/21.  Returning this item. USPS 9202090153540020532620<br />It took a long time to receive this item.  Also it shows that item is loose fit, it was not. Quality was low, no panty lining or crotch lining."
3.0,Would give 5 stars but charm was missing off one of the braclets.
3.0,The logo is merely a heat-applied logo.  It won't last.  It looks cheaply made. The price is far too high for this product.  The hat alone is not worth the price.  Save your money.
3.0,"I really liked these keychains, but I will say that the key rings were messed up on mine. I will probably have to use pliers to fix one of them. Also, the key rings, these key chains are attached too, are also rather large in comparison to the keychain, but I still like the product and think it’s a cute little “just because” gift for my boyfriend."
3.0,"Considering this dress isn't lined and it is really cold outside now, it did fit, but because the zipper is on the side my MS doesn't allow me to use my hand I wasn't able to wear the dress to the place I wanted it for. otherwise, it is a beautiful dress."
3.0,The only way I can wear these shoes is with very thick socks. People said different things about the fit. I should have stuck with my original choice. I am a true 9.5 in some shoes and a 10 in others. I took a chance on these and way too big.
3.0,Nice pattern but fit a bit too tight.
3.0,"FIRST UPDATE Jan, 2023: After buying and loving the navy muffs, I ordered a brown and beige.  They are very different from the navy ones.  The two newest don't adjust very much and the neck part is too long so that they slide down and fall off!  I am returning them.  Sadly, I lost the navy ones already, but I'm going to reorder, hoping they will be like the first ones.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE Jan, 2023:  Returned the brown and beige.  Reordered the navy and they are clearly a different design.  The connecting strap on the navy is fully adjustable and is snug against my neck like the first pair.  What a bummer to find that the design is variable and unreliable.  I won't be buying any more except navy!<br /><br />Dec. 2022:  I'm trying to find the ideal ear muffs.  These are truly adjustable (unlike ones I've returned which weren't) and are gentle in the pressure they exert.  Some I've had press so hard, I have to remove them from time to time.  Those went back too.  These have stayed in place; they don't work their way down or back, requiring readjustment. These also twist so that they compact and can fit in a coat pocket or purse. I'm going to wear them a few weeks longer before I buy a few more pairs, but it's looking likely."
3.0,"This item was to tight & to short in the torso region. I recommend ordering 2 sizes up. I originally ordered a XL, since I'm a Lg but did not fit. I will order a 2XL.<br />Update: The option for a 2X, does not appear to be an XXL. They ended up sending me another XL. I will not buy from them again."
3.0,All three shirts fit totally different. Not a fan of them at all.
3.0,Not happy to fight on the arms
3.0,It's nice to wear and see but I was expecting it a little smaller and with smaller stones.
3.0,"Days of the week are in Spanish ! Not mentioned in the ad, which it should have been. It's an inexpensive watch and is nice for the money. I understand that. But they do make them in English."
3.0,Little short and twisted. Would be a great product if a couple flaws ironed out.
3.0,Beautiful skirt. I normally wear large but ordered an X-large after reading reviews.... it was still way too small (it fit but very tight elastic around waist)
3.0,This tutu was okay but It was pretty thin. We were looking for something with a little more material and less see through than this.
3.0,Matches my watch well but I have really small wrists. The XS is too big
3.0,"I had to reorder, because I had ordered a red pair and received a black pair. Second order was the same (ordered red, got black). I usually don't write critical reviews if there is one mistake like this and it is rectified, but this is ridiculous!"
3.0,Not very flattering and the configuration of the straps in the back complicate getting it on.  Then I have to be careful that my hair is out of the way when I work my arms out of the straps.
3.0,I just received the shirt.  I love the print. My size was XL.amd when I put it on.  The top of shirt was way to small.
3.0,"I bought 2 dresses from this seller, but I had to return both!  I felt it’s fabric is thin n cheap , it’s not 95% rayon as described in your weob and no tag  at all, I think it’s polyester.<br />The return took me so much time !<br />About one dress, yI had to print the return mailing label and sent it to the USPS post office, not Amazon return store !!<br />You should not purchase from this seller, it’s like a cheat!!"
3.0,"I really liked the styling on the sweater and took a gamble ordering prior to any reviews. Alas, it is at least 2 sizes too small (more like a US men's large). I am giving to my wife. I would buy again if they offer it in a 4X....sigh."
3.0,Cute shoes but not good for wide feet
3.0,"I'm a small girl, so I ordered the smallest size. I was swimming in this! Buyer beware of the size. The color is pretty, the fabric is thin and soft, I just wish it fit me better! Luckily I have some tricks for making giant things fit me better."
3.0,Very soft fabric but NOT 95% cotton.  Still deciding whether to return.
3.0,Kind've heavy and the clasp broke the first time I tried to open it.  I returned it since it broke although it was very pretty.  If it hadn't broken I would've kept it and probably given it 4 stars.
3.0,"These are made very cheaply, but look kind of ok... I want expecting a whole lot for the price, but I was expecting a little better... It looks like they cut a plastic beaded necklace and just glued it on the end of a tunnel."
3.0,Loved this shirt but I shop Lands End specifically for their petites. These sleeves were definately NOT petite and I had to role them up. Wanted to try a smaller size (I usually order small) but they were out of stock. So disappointed - I wear it anyway but Lands End does not usually disappoint.
3.0,Cute bracelet but very heavy and big. I have small (adult) wrists and it's still very loose on the tightest link. I prefer more dainty bangles such as A&A but I received this as a gift so I won't be returning it. I can't speak to durability yet.
3.0,"I actually had this at a discounted price, but waited an extra day and saw it go up by $8. Still cheaper than what I could get it elsewhere. The ascot is somewhat, well I mean why? A white long tee would have been a lot better. And no gloves, but you include the mask? Even cheap white gloves would have been nice. Of course onto the mask and that I'll have to agree with people. I have another rubberized mask that was a lot more rigid, but with this one, needed to get the shape by stuffing the mask and using low heat on a hair dryer over time to get as close to realistic as possible. The first issue is, why not make the area around the eyes a lot more rigid? That would have a solved a lot of the problem there. And yes it gets hot, but guess what? It's a latex mask and you will get hot unless it's NOT hot outside! Should be fine Halloween evening, but indoors may get me drenched in sweat. All in all a decent costume..."
3.0,I was not overly impressed with this product. My initial reason for purchasing this bracelet was to use it for saying prayers as I counted the knots. The bracelet was extremely tightly knotted and made the counting very difficult. It did not seem to have any &#34;give&#34; even after repeated usage. I was not unhappy when I lost it! (Maybe the bracelet left when it sensed my attitude!)
3.0,"Used this for my passport and other ids and cards while traveling. It is bulky, cheap quality and steadily tore more and more."
3.0,"I really love these. They are so comfy and versatile. I wore them to work first, got lots of compliments. The reason for the 3 stars are for the way they gather on the sides. You pull the rope and that's it, no way to secure (snap, tie) at all . Within minutes the pants are straight, then you pull again and it falls again. Very very frustrating. I end up cutting a small whole in the basting fabric for the rope, pulled the rope through there, then tied it off. Didn't have anymore problems."
3.0,Two rings broke
3.0,I don't love this material as much as their other kind
3.0,"First off, the crotch region of these pants is not fit to be seen in public, so you'll have to wear a long shirt that covers the butt. There are strange seams that go up the buttocks portion of the pants onto each butt cheek. They look like long johns almost... Secondly, after the first few washes, they start to get really linty.. like the kind of lint that sticks and doesn't come off and i've had to use my razor to shave off the lint that's been balling up. Other than them being really tight and having strange seams, they are pretty comfortable and i've enjoyed wearing them around the house."
3.0,Outfit was exactly as looks in picutes ...only downfall is the material is more like cheap thin costume material and the pockets are small.
3.0,In the pack I received a pair that was the actual size and a pair that was a size below what I wear. A little frustrating but the pair that fit were excellent.
3.0,"Expected necklace to be longer. Also had a skin reaction to metal, which has never happened to me before."
3.0,i expected a bit biger. it did not fit
3.0,These are very cute but definitely were not child sized. They were huge on my 4 and 7 year olds but I will be able to wear them ( adult woman ) so I will keep it but sad I will have to keep looking for a children’s size.
3.0,Works OK for adults and is not at all kid friendly as stated. Slides down my 5 year olds face.
3.0,They do not fit up to a size 12 very well. They were very see-through and I'm a size 10. Ended up giving them to my size 4 sister. They fit her great!
3.0,"stone nice, but not packaged correctly, so band got damaged.  silver design sort of strange looking on."
3.0,"Received them yesterday, wore them to run today and they do not stay up. They fit snug but they do not stay above my waist. A smaller size would not fit as I struggled to pull these on, I believe the problem is the waistband. However if you are not using these to run then they are super cute"
3.0,Love the color. Very feminine! Good quality but had a little difficulty attaching screws on to my fit bit. Takes a couple tries to put on.
3.0,A little smaller than I thought
3.0,I actually returned this.  I didn't like the metal zippers
3.0,"It is tight but I got the same size that's usually a bit big on me. So get a size up. The material is a bit thinner than what I expected. But all in all, it's worth it's price"
3.0,"It's just ok..nothing special or wrong..just ""ok""."
3.0,"Actually too tight, I had to return it because my foot would fit in the shoe. I have small thin feet but I do have high arches. They were really cute and soft!"
3.0,"I love this watch.  Beautiful band, very heavy,  not cheaply made,  but after only 1 week of use it has started turning itself on randomly,  and sometimes randomly jumping into set mode.<br /><br />It has also jumped into set mode and paged itself through all of it's modes.<br /><br />Even as I write this I'm watching it turn on and off over on my desk.<br /><br />I may just exchange this.  I love it, but it's faulty."
3.0,"The dress was nice overall, but the dress color was incorrect. It said burgundy but it was more of a dark red. Only reason I returned it because I need to match the other bridesmaids!"
3.0,"Love the look, but the little chains catch on stuff easily, and broke off quickly. Going to have to get another watch band for it. Watch part works great!"
3.0,"Looked great the first couple of times I wore it. After the third (gentle cycle) wash, it had pulls and is basically falling apart."
3.0,"Very, very full skirt. 2 layers. If you need it hemmed it’s going to cost. Don’t really know how the fit was in top. It needed to be laced up. I’m sure it would have fit fine. Was pretty. Just too much skirt. Way too long."
3.0,It looks and feels good but the large was way to small when other larges fit fine.
3.0,Bien . Lindo diseño
3.0,cute and good quality;  ran a little small
3.0,Kinda small on 5 1/2
3.0,"Greetings, OK sunglasses - however very dark -as in black although these look violet/purple. If you want a good dark tint...these will work for you.peace"
3.0,"Very light weight, loved the color, I got the tortoise shell, however they are narrow and look more like readers than sunglasses. I would have preferred for the lenses to be a bit larger."
3.0,The goggles fogged on the first time using them. I was hoping to get more than that.
3.0,These are great for long hair or braids/locs. They leave behind a black/purplish color on my pillowcases. Even after washing them
3.0,I gave it to my 15 year old daughter
3.0,I had to do quite a bit of grinding with a dremel toolbon the band to get it to work with my Casio divers watch.  The band is designed for watches with longer mounting lugs than my watch has.
3.0,"Beautiful jewelry, however there's a problem with the posts of the earrings. An indentation at the tip that makes it difficult to pull the back tabs off and back on. Flaw design remedied by taking a metal nail filer and grinding it smooth."
3.0,Like it but changing color.
3.0,Very cute purse but looks like a child's purse.  Too small to hold much-had to return.
3.0,"Less durable than I was expecting. Much thinner than my previous pair. Already seeing blue through the black latex layer, and I've been babying them."
3.0,"It not like picture, the color green is ugly"
3.0,I got this in the grey. The visor itself has a nice look and style but it’s SMALL. It would be a perfect size for little kids heads. FYI I’m a woman with an average size head.
3.0,The color wasn’t like I thought it would be no yellow & mostly grey.  The sizing wasn’t a good fit
3.0,Dress fits as expected however material was a little stiff but after one washing it seemed to soften up.
3.0,"Tip..if you need to expand the arms, use a pen or pencil so they'll keep the shape. Required quite a bit of manipulating to get the arms to securely hold on to my ears. They're quite tiny. I lost mine within about a week. It would be awesome if there was a way to secure them to an ear without piercing."
3.0,Look at my photos.<br />Cons:  I constantly struggle with trying to put the sunglasses clip onto my glasses.  I have learned that it is impossible to clip these on my glasses while I am driving because it takes two hands and careful manipulation to get them clipped on.  The  rubber pads which protect your lenses easily fall off.  The rubber pads will also cause smears on the lenses of your eye glasses.<br /><br />Pros:  I do like the image quality of the polarized lenses and they don't really look like clip-ons from a distance.
3.0,"love the fabric, however the bottom is not as shown in the picture, it is cut straight and not tapered up on the sides."
3.0,I didn't like these because the fit to close to my face and slim profile. The would be good for wearing with a hat as they do not come up high.
3.0,"Looks great but sounds a little noisy when you walk. Not enough curve on the bottom of the shoe for graceful walking, so your feet always pull on the straps which hurts your feet plus it ruins the shoe faster. After a few months use the straps lifted the insole from the sides where they are attached. Ok for the price"
3.0,"This top didn’t fit how I hoped. Kind of wide and didn’t taper enough. Cheaper material than I thought, and was hoping it would be a little longer."
3.0,I bought this in a large based on reviews. It was too big and the pockets hit the worst part on my body making me look much heavier
3.0,Made very good but was hoping it would fit over my wrist to carry keys.  Definitely too small.  Delivery was prompt
3.0,Very cute stack of bracelets after only a couple of wears beads broke and fell apart. I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed
3.0,"Dress was way too big, I measured before buying and my measurements were a little larger than the xl—but since the other reviewers said this runs large I figured it would work. By “it runs large” we really mean “it’s huge!”<br />I think I would probably need a medium instead, but I’m just returning the product. The fabric is shinier than I was expecting so it’s hard to see the pattern in person.<br />The fabric is really soft and quite stretchy and I can tell it would be super comfortable in the right size."
3.0,I returned this dress just didn’t fit like I would thought. Sweetheart neck line wasn’t for me I’m 55 yrs old and it seemed young for me the flair on the skirt was a full flare not flattering at all
3.0,"Loved the idea of this suit -- sporty and great for paddle boarding -- but it fit me strangely. The stomach part and the back were too large, so it stretched in a straight line along my torso concealing all curves. I appreciate the seller's prompt return, though."
3.0,Shorts did not match color on shirt. They were yellow not reen
3.0,For reference I’m 5’7 and they were too short on my legs. Otherwise beautiful color and actually don’t give you this flat butt effect like a lot of sweatpants of this style
3.0,Beautiful but had a small yellowish brownish spot on it. came out first wash
3.0,I like the size and the set up of the item. My problem is that the zipper is not good quality.  When you zip it up it tends to not zip past a couple spots without lining the zipper up carefully and working over the bad spot.
3.0,The top and bottom of the dress was not the same color of black. I will wear a belt to camouflage that
3.0,"Great dress, but a little smaller than I had hoped, and a little shorter than I desired. Overall great dress."
3.0,"These earrings are beautiful, Yet very delicate. The Crosses broke off very easily, Handle with care."
3.0,"Not a great shirt, but I wanted something red.."
3.0,"I don’t believe this boot is truly leather. It has a strong chemical smell inially. I wear a sz 81/2 my feet are wide. The boot fit comfortably and the fur inside keeps ur feet toasty. However the rubber heal isn’t 1 solid piece, makin that somewhat uncomfortable for me."
3.0,They were bigger than I wanted
3.0,The quality of this was nice but the fit was very small and tight on my husband's wrists...he is thin.  Not sure if they offer different sizes?
3.0,Very cute but the pin broke off easily
3.0,Returned it didn't like the material and way to small even though I ordered my size
3.0,"This shirt is ok. Colors are much brighter in person, which diminishes the look & makes it look cheaper. Material is poly/spandex blend & kind of shiny -again, makes it look cheaper. It is not cozy feeling like the picture would indicate. This should not be marketed as a sweatshirt. It is just a long sleeved, kind of slippery shirt. The fit is ok, not necessarily super flattering. I will keep it & wear it around the house."
3.0,The large suckers are really heavy and have a long stick. The shorter ones are great.
3.0,"decent belt, buckle and the latching piece are both just a tad large to easily run through belt loops, other than that the belt has been great the last few months"
3.0,"Not quite enough stretch for me; not form fitting. After one washing, they look like they may pill quite a bit. They are, however, soft and warm."
3.0,"Very stretch, fits well but is too short and rolls up easily."
3.0,"I really like the colors and feel/flowiness of the tri-striped version of this dress. The wrap feature is great for regular use, as well as for maternity. My only complaint is that the front portion of the pink-ish striped dress is really short (to the point where I think I might have to wear this over leggings or pants :(). The wrap nature of the dress makes pinning it not really an option. It's too bad, because the rest of the dress is long and fits nicely and modestly! There wasn't the same issue on the blue version of this dress, but the material wasn't as cool and comfortable on that one."
3.0,"Great item for its cost. Light, greta looks, I will not test the water resitance..."
3.0,"it was all right but for the price you get what you paid for, it got kinda rusty after a while."
3.0,Very cute dress. I ordered a 2xl because I have hips and butt but it ended up being baggy. An xl would have been perfect but I am retiring the 2xl
3.0,I'm just okay with these. Working out the practical uses for them.
3.0,"My daughter complains that the back of her foot hurts with this shoes, they have a seem on the heel that sticks out, not a good design"
3.0,"I absolutely love this ring, but i am upset that the enamel paint inside the suites comes off easier than id like. So far after two weeks of wearing it, i have just 1 red diamond left, even the spade and club‘s paint has chipped, not too noticeable though but now its a solid black ring. Still love it tho."
3.0,The color is beautiful however the sleeves were too short for me and hovered around 4 inches above my wrist. The length of the coat itself fit but was about on the long side. Functions well when thrown over your shoulder for that fashionable look.
3.0,"For the price, it's an excellent looking watch. The light feature is a little dim but works ok. After one month, the bottom left button popped out by itself. Luckily I found it stuck it back in. Shouldn't be so easy to remove. Let's see how long it all holds up.<br />Update: one button fell out and it's gone. This is just ridiculous that a watch of this cost started losing its pieces not even six months in."
3.0,"The product is not super soft flannel. It is not true to size, running smaller, so order larger. The product is labeled ""TALL"", so mine go below my knees. All of this is not consistent with the product description. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
3.0,is tight.
3.0,"I ordered a medium, but it fits like a large. I think a small would fit me better with this product and that's surprising because I'm usually in the middle of medium and large, with large fitting better and medium a bit tighter. It's a bit baggy on the sides and on the arms. The length is good. The quality of the material is what you expect a $15 hoodie to have - not stellar. Looks like it will loosen up even further and lose its elasticity after a couple washes."
3.0,"Maybe it will get more comfortable over time, but it's much stiffer than a typical leather belt."
3.0,"They're perfect for an evening gown. I recommend better,  proper and more secure packaging.  It was not easy taking it out of the plastic package."
3.0,"well, first I got gold and white, not silver and white like I ordered.... then they don't really fit right, so I tried to gently squeeze them to fit better and the piece above the nose snapped, which turns out is plastic....so they look cool, but are kinda cheap :-)"
3.0,"There were 96 pieces not 110, 2 of which were broken. Even though that was the case, this was still a good value for the money. Mostly acrylic ends, some silicone ends and a few with metal ends."
3.0,It's not breathable.
3.0,"I'm a 12/14 and ordered a large. It definitely doesn't fit on me like it looks in the photo; it's a tight-spandex material, so it's really snug. Not what I expected for a maxi dress. Contacted the company, and they offered to send me a size up for free. I'll give them credit for that."
3.0,The Leo is really cute but the rhinestones fall off easily
3.0,"This could be a cute dress, but didn't work because it was too large in the chest and revealed too much."
3.0,I absolutely love this dress! The orange color is everything. It’s elegant with just the right pop! I am giving 3 stars because I had to get the dress altered. I ordered a small and I have a fairly large top so I was surprised to find that the shoulders and chest area was definitely too loose! The dress fit was perfect otherwise.
3.0,It seems a little cheaply made but it served its purpose
3.0,"I ordered an XL because i wanted a loose airy sundress for the summer.  However, after the first wash, it shrunk to a M size - very disappointed.  It was actually very nicely made and good quality - just didn't hold the size after washing (yes, I followed the washing instructions)."
3.0,My husband wears Medium in old Navy shirts and I bought a large since Chinese clothing sometimes runs a tad small but I should have stuck to a medium. This fabric does not stretch.
3.0,"Nice packaging, style and feel.  Make sure you add in extra inch or two when ordering.<br />Fit: Too Small"
3.0,"I bought this shirt for myself in an XL after reading the reviews.  I normally would wear a men's L.  After washing, the XL fits as a size L.  They are very thin, as well.  I prefer shirts that don't feel like they'll rip with no effort.  BUYER BEWARE!!!<br /><br />WHY is Pepsi giving this crap out?? The previous pepsi stuff promotion had quality items--the t-shirt I got from that promotion is still in excellent condition despite being worn literally a few hundred times.  I doubt this one will last a year."
3.0,"I love the features of this bag, but it is just so cold for my son, totally unusual for Marmot.  Comparing this to my Women's 30, and my husband's Men's 30, this is even thinner.  It's normal for Men's to be thinner (the equivalency of a Women's 30 is a Men's 15, because men are modeled as having 15 degrees more temperature tolerance, though I've never understood why).  However, having a Youth 30 even thinner than a Men's 30 is crazy!  This bag is just too cold - treat it like a 45 not a 30."
3.0,The clip slips out at times
3.0,"These look wonderful, but the fit is like a cheap slipper Not enough support.  Not enough furry lining."
3.0,Was a bit bigger than expected
3.0,I found this dress very cute. But the fabric is very cheap as the price reflects. It is fine but I don't see this outfit lasting long.
3.0,Don’t order the yellow it’s literally orange
3.0,These shoes look absolutely amazing but unfortunately I had to return them.  They seemed to run narrow and they just weren't comfortable.  I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them all day at work.  Hated to send them back but they just didn't work for me.
3.0,I thought they would be really warm but my hands still got cold. Not much give so don’t  wear them much.
3.0,"This is a knock-off of the MiNi watches. I was dumb and got excited thinking it was the real deal. I should have known with a $10 price tag that it was fake. But I digress.<br /><br />That being said, for what it’s worth, it’s a decent looking watch. The actual body of the watch feels sturdy and the handcrafted clay interior looks decently made. If you’re a teen or a woman wanting to wear this, the strap length is definitely made for a child (yeah I didn’t read ‘child’ in the description either). Speaking of the strap, the material is some strange, cheap leather lookalike. In my attempt to put the watch on my wrist, my nail chipped away some of the green from the “leather”.<br /><br />I’m not holding my breath to see this watch last long. It looks cute and interesting from far away but I kind of feel like I wasted $10 that I could have used to put towards the real one.<br /><br />One good thing though, they did pack some extra batteries."
3.0,"Cute dress with fun pockets in colors that my granddaughter loves. Ordered a 4T and the label in the dress indicates 3-4T. While running small in the shoulders and chest, the gathers and additional fabric due to the cute pocket design mean that I do not need to return for a larger size."
3.0,They roll up!
3.0,"The quality appears to be great, but the shirt(s) are too short. I recommend ordering the largest size they have to order."
3.0,Order a size up.. i put it on with a small struggle bt knew that would enhance my curves.. but when i took off; i got so frustrated that i had to literally cut it off with a knife 😫🤦🏽‍♀️
3.0,"These shorts have an adorable pattern and fit comfortably loose, but the fabric is almost like windbreaker/ running short material. Not the flowy fabric I was hoping for."
3.0,"This item fit perfectly (normally wear a small and ordered a small), the only issue I have is the material on the white option was incredibly see through. You can see all the seams and the part that wraps and buttons you can see. But I like the material and I he buttons. I did end up returning this items because even with a slip it was see through."
3.0,Cute but wore for a few hours and started falling apart baby isnt even crawling yet.
3.0,"First off I love the latch mechanism on this belt, it is my favorite of all the other belts I have ever had. If I based the rating on just the buckle action it would be 6 stars. Unfortunately as others have posted on the reviews, I have had issues with the belt durability. The problem I have is since the buckle bites into the end of the leather, the very end tears off after a fairly short period of time (usually a couple of weeks). I purchased mine about a year ago, and I am almost out of belt because I have to keep cutting a quarter inch off at a time. This could be fixed by either using better materials in the belt, changing the clamp design in the buckle, or even having some additional re-enforcement down the center of the belt instead of just the 2 outer strips of stitches. I wouldn't suggest putting stitching down the center of the belt, but even laminating the pieces together with an industrial glue would help. I really hope I hear back from the customer support with a solution to this, otherwise I would have to replace the belt section about 1/year.  [[ASIN:B01CYUJG1W Marino Men's Genuine Leather Ratchet Dress Belt with Linxx Buckle, Enclosed in an Elegant Gift Box - Tan Weave Design Leather Buckle with Tan Leather - Custom: Up to 44&#34; Waist]]"
3.0,The Glo Bag Chrome Emblem on the bag was damaged when it arrived.
3.0,"I returned these since they were way to big for my 6 year old grandson.  And, he is bigger than a regular 6 year old.  The quality seemed nice.  Just didn't fit."
3.0,Good quality but sad it was to big
3.0,"I give it 3 stars because while I love the color, the fit, and the length, I would actually prefer the dress without the pockets. I am 5'3, and while the dress length is PERFECT, the pockets add this widened look to my hips, and too a short girl, makes me look a little frumpy. The fabric is also really thick too so not a great dress if it is really hot. However, for the price I am happy with it because its pretty cute. Thinking about cutting the pockets out to get rid of some of that fabric near my hips"
3.0,"DID NOT LIKE THE MATERIAL IT MUCH TOO THICK, BUT I GUESS THEY WILL WORK. I DO NOT WANT TO RETURN THEM, TOO MUCH HASSLE.  THANK YOU.  JENNIFER"
3.0,"I am typically a large, but this shirt was huge!"
3.0,"They fit a little baggy, resulting in an improper fit with the design looking a little wonky."
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to a semi-formal wedding. A LBD was perfect for the occasion, but this one wasn't that great. The material is thin, and somewhat clingy, so therefor very unforgiving for a post-partum mom. The center panel that you pull to the side to nurse in isn't sewn with a stretch/elastic thread, so it's hard to pull aside to actually nurse. I can't imagine trying to wear this when more than 5 months pregnant. It would not be at all flattering."
3.0,broke first time i wore it
3.0,Very light. Not a lot of metal but it's beautiful and it hasn't broken. The hooks see so thin but they're holding up.
3.0,"I am 5""5 usually a size 10  or medium and a 36C cup size and dress is too tight in chest area, made for smaller chest"
3.0,"Kinda large and not very strong either, sudden movement causes the stitches to pop."
3.0,"I wish I had ordered a size up. I usually read the reviews and thought I had read for this, but it was tighter, I guess more fitted than I wanted."
3.0,"Nice, but the zipper is cheap and broke the 2nd time I wore it. I do like the pants though so I will spend the money to have it repaired."
3.0,Upon opening package swimsuit has a grease stain…… hoping it will come out!!
3.0,Runs small and torso really short arms are long though.  I guess they believe that bigger people only have long arms but short torsos.
3.0,"While I like the style, I wasn't expecting the material to be as ribbed as it is, as well as the bottom being really wide therefor looking a little &#34;shlumpy&#34;."
3.0,I am a plus size 18/20. I purchased xxl. The overall size/length fit my body. It was very snug on my arms - I cannot move in it.
3.0,"Plenty long and sort of enough to go around, but seemed small as the side seam and pockets were too far back. Just oddly shaped and I'm returning it. Sleeves nice and long though."
3.0,"They’re pretty (definitely not real looking- but didn’t expect that). Way too big for me to wear tho. So if you want a large appearance, then you may like hem."
3.0,"I like the idea of this, however it rolls down a lot, therefore I have to continue to pull them back up."
3.0,"Cute color, and I like that the bar is metal. Very comfortable and lightweight. However, the ball on the top randomly broke after a couple of weeks. I am not sure if the acrylic is cheap or if it was just a fluke. It is cheap and I liked it so I am ordering another one one to see."
3.0,"Unfortunately most of the positive reviews for these watches are from individuals whom have received this watch at a discounted or near for free price by providing a &#34;unbiased review&#34;..  i am one whom actually purchased this for its actual price but returned it..<br /><br />That being said, the pros are its a good quality watch with decent movement for the money..cons are, although I'm 6ft 225, this watch looked outright silly on my wrist as the face is to large.  The main analog dial is smaller than most watches and is hard to read.  My g shock and citizens are easier t to read and have 41-44mm bezels.  Also the bezel is so large that it restricts wrist movement, that you'll find yourself taking it off frequently to do basic tasks as it hits the top of your wrist when extending back. The watch strap feels a bit slippery even when strapped down snugly."
3.0,Cool to play dressup with
3.0,Nice product but runs small!
3.0,"It was cute, the material was horrible and hugged the body versus draping.  Loved the color."
3.0,"I bought a pair of blue shoes for my son and pink for my daughter.  I bought them one size bigger and they both fit with extra room as I expected and I appreciate. The reason for only three stars, is because the inside Bottom part of my sons shoe came off the very first time he wore them. Very disappointed in the quality"
3.0,I was really excited for this dress because it looked so cute! And it was! this dress is ADORABLE..... on my ten year-old Sister. It was waaaay too small which is a pity.
3.0,I bought this for someone else but kept it for myself because it is not great quality...but what do you expect for the price? Meh.
3.0,"I ordered the short-sleeve style, but what I received was a sleeveless style. I really didn’t want a sleeveless top so this was a bummer.<br /><br />PROS:<br />(1) I liked the v-shaped neckline with the button placket styling.<br />(2) The texture dots in the fabric gave it a cute appearance.<br /><br />CONS:<br />(1) The fabric is a low-to-mid level quality.<br />(2) The stitching was messy along the front placket.<br />(3) The side seams just below the armholes were poorly shaped. I took the blouse to my sewing machine and fixed the issue,<br />(4) I felt the sizing ran a bit small, especially through the hips. I got a Large, a size that is typically more than roomy enough in the hips, but this one was a bit snug there.<br /><br />I’m only 5’3” tall so most tops are way too long on me so I usually shorten them. This top was no different. Thankfully, I’m handy with my sewing machine. I cut more than 3” from the hem of this blouse to shorten it and removed the curved hem in the back to make the hem even in front and back. (I didn’t deduct any stars for the excess length, I just mention this in case you are my height, then you’ll know that the top will be rather long on you.)<br /><br />Overall, this top is appropriately priced ($20) for its quality but the warehouse needs to be more careful about shipping out the correct product that is ordered by the customer."
3.0,It smelled so bad (fishy).
3.0,Is ok just ok
3.0,"The bag in the photo is cute, and it's a great color. But...when it arrived the fringes were pretty much sticking straight out.<br />It's possibly due to how the bag was stored but they won't go down. Sadly, I'm sending it back."
3.0,I ordered a medium which is normally what I wear I'm 5'3 146 lbs a little curvy I had to send the the medium back because I couldn't even button it then I reordered a large and even the large is to small it really cuts into my wasted and is somewhat uncomfortable...I ended up keeping it because I like it so much it's so pretty so I'm gonna try and get it aultered in some way.
3.0,Some of the stones are missing<br />But it’s pretty
3.0,band is very small!
3.0,Had to return. Not a good fit.
3.0,The pockets started fraying.
3.0,"Great,It is very  cheap"
3.0,The print was cute but not all black.
3.0,"I was disappointed when I received this rhinestone purse! It is so small, I can barely fit my phone with it's case on in it!<br />  I also noticed a big flaw of frayed rhinestones coming apart from the purse by the zipper area! Then inside the purse, it has a clunky chain that is made of plastic and looks really fake, that you can clip on to the rings on each side of the purse. Also, inside the purse is a really long, thin, chain for the strap that hooks on the rings on the sides as well, to carry the purse on your shoulder or just hold. For me, it was too long of a chain to carry on my shoulder and hangs too low. Then the plastic, big, clunky, chain hangs lower than the actual purse and ends up staying on the very bottom of the purse!<br />  Overall, this rhinestone purse was a huge disappointment! This purse is too small, low in quality, and not very well made for part of it to be coming apart already!<br /> I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! It's NOT a good value for what you get!"
3.0,"The material is like paper, but it wears fairly comfortably..  For the very inexpensive price, I can't complain too much.  I wear it mostly around the house or going out for errands.  It does get stylish compliments, as it is unique style and design"
3.0,These fit well but the are not dark enough to be outside on a bright sunny day.
3.0,"Showed way too much when I would raise my arms, so sadly just too short for a business casual setting. Dress was cute though just too short for what I needed!"
3.0,"This is cute, but not as thick is it appears in the picture. Somewhat cheap, but you get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,Cute bottom but the top was too small.
3.0,It's cute bit a little hard to figure out and not easy to operate for a kid.
3.0,This was way too long. Got a large because of a larger bust but it should have fit me fine. 5'5 &1/2&#34; height. It fit other than the length. You would have to be quite tall for it to not drag
3.0,Its has little support  but covers full chest  size is right on for me
3.0,"Very small, super tight fitting, super lightweight material. Cheap."
3.0,"I would have liked the dress to fit a little tighter. It fits well, but as a personal preference I wish it was sleigh you smaller."
3.0,decent shirt but runs very very small.
3.0,"Perfect for chilly Fall days! I like the material. It's mostly cotton. (No polyester!) The details on the sleeves are eye-catching. BUT, it's impossible to differentiate the front from the back, cause there's no tag where you'd expect one to be!!!"
3.0,"Top very nice, pants are very thin and fabric  wrinkled even when just washed/taken out and hung up."
3.0,The price was cheap should’ve known better.  The stones are only on one side so... When you put the belly ring in the stones don’t line up one of them faces the side and the other is completely backwards. Wouldn’t really recommend
3.0,Bought this as a gift for my daughter and had to look back on Amazon to see what it says because the print is very tiny.
3.0,"Serves it's purpuse, but won't stay zipped up. The zipper always pinches me."
3.0,"I rated this product 3 stars due to functionality. These are really dark lenses. Unless the sun is absolutely blasting these glasses are too dark in my opinion. When I wear them in my car it almost feels like it’s night time. If you’re looking for a cheap pair of shades that are similar to these, go with the Neffs"
3.0,Love all of the colors in this set. Some of the jewels are very loose though. So far none have fallen out though.
3.0,Temple pieces still hurt my ear.
3.0,ONE OF THE EAR RING STUD WAS NOT ON ONE EARRING.
3.0,"Too big, unwieldy and impractical"
3.0,"Love the glasses.  I had to throw three case covers because they reek of cigarette smoke, the bubble wrap etc"
3.0,"This is very cute. Look s like its pretty well made, but it is made in China and is small. I ordered a medium which normally would have been really roomy for me but its quite small on me. I'd order up 2 sizes if you like a comfy sweater. I bought the teal color and it is a very pretty shade."
3.0,sizing is way off.  I even ordered 2 sizes larger and it still fit tight.
3.0,The material is very nice. The design on the front is like a sticker and I believe after a few washes it will start to peel off.
3.0,Really cool design and great idea but doesn't fit my ear so I can't use it.
3.0,It fit and it's kinda cute but it does not look or fit the way the photo looks at all. There's also a weird shape on one side that is not a pocket....it's really weird like an extra piece of material or something.
3.0,I love the pattern and fit of this dress. My only complaint is the quality of the material - it's very thin and not lined. I expected more for the price. I'm keeping it though because the pattern is very pretty.
3.0,"This item was purchased for a teenager and she really loved the color of it. However, this did not fit her face properly and spent more time pulling it up than being useful so we had to use a different face mask. Thank you."
3.0,Liked the hat but pom pom fell off immediately.
3.0,Bought this for a trip to Australia. Loved the way it was laid out inside and the pattern was actually really pretty. It is a cheaper quality I wouldn’t use it again for a long trip with lots of connections. Seams are ripping inside and the zipper busted open a few times.
3.0,Handy size.  Fits well in cup holders.  BUT it did not keep liquid cold long. Not as advertized.
3.0,"The material is weird, order size up if you have a larger chest."
3.0,"OK quality, not the best"
3.0,Very beautiful a little pricey
3.0,"Very pretty, magnet not as strong as I hoped for. One pair was broken when I received it."
3.0,Material too soft and does not fall nicely.
3.0,I really like this apron to wear in my daycare. The only problem the pockets weren't sewed good. With the 2 nd time I wore it it came unseeded.
3.0,This dress was really cute but a lot looser and shorter than expected. I bought it for work but it’s definitely too short to wear compared to what it looked like online
3.0,"I put the first band on my watch and one end starting coming loose before I could even get it on. The second one seems to be ok, but I don’t want to put any stress on it for fear it will also come apart."
3.0,"I love a small silver hoop for every day wear, so ordered these & I really like the light & bright silver color.<br /><br />BUT — do I have thick lobes or something?? The post barely fits through to the back... I wiggled & squished & got it through, but then had to work the clasp.<br />The “V” shape that the post is supposed to click into was too closed on one & too wide on the other, so a pair of needle nose pliers later, I got them to click in. (Should not have to do this!)<br /><br />They come in a little gray drawstring bag which is a nice touch, but need a little work on quality control & then these earring would be a good value.<br /><br />**Thanks for taking the time & I hope my review is Helpful!**"
3.0,"It's pretty, but for the price I expect a more substantial piece. It is like a pressed piece of metal sheet. It's ok though."
3.0,Way to loose and ear loops stretch too much
3.0,These fit like a jock strap. After a couple of hours you feel like changing to something more comfortable.
3.0,Ran small.  The facet beads are nice but the rest are dark metal.
3.0,These are very flimsy/thin metal. They flex a lot side to side but seem to keep their shape.
3.0,"Nice bag,not too cheaply made but bigger than I expected."
3.0,Appears to be good quality but fit wasn't as expected unfortunately. Fabric is good though.
3.0,Nice watch but too big.
3.0,"Gloves are fine but I really wanted the red and navy colored. Got a few pair of white, ugh. Will keep them, but will still have to go out looking for the colors I really want. Stretch well. Just a bit snug for my husband,but they can still help to kept his hands warm just hanging out on a chilly night."
3.0,I bought this lovely ring . it came on time and was beautiful. Only reason i give it a three star is because. The. First day i wore the ring it turned my finger green.. If you plan on buying this ring limited time wearing  it..
3.0,"didn't rock my world, the quality is mediocre - but certainly comfortable and cute on. Wore it with a white boat neck t to work on casual day and looked cute - but not one compliment, so maybe just cute in my world?"
3.0,"It's a pretty necklace, I'm not too crazy about the rusty smell though."
3.0,For a theme
3.0,A bit disappointed. I'm always a Large sometimes a medium. And these pants were too small.
3.0,"I REALLY LIKE THIS SWIMSUIT.  THE MATERIAL IS GREAT AND SEEMS DURABLE.  ALSO, IT FITS GREAT.<br />I initially gave it a FIVE, but have changed it to a THREE because the legs don't stay in place.<br />THEY ROLL UP, and the BOY-LEG was one of the MAIN reason why I bought this swimsuit.<br />I'll be returning."
3.0,mine looks smaller than the pic
3.0,"Nice dress. However, it’s definitely cut for smaller shoulders and arms."
3.0,Size medium is huge. Top came diwn to hips. Pants super long.<br />Im 5 ft 2 115 lbs. Dont even know if a small will fit. Fabric is very soft. Wish it would ve fit. Returned
3.0,Order 1 or 2 sizes up
3.0,Sizes were off on some. One sock was huge and the other was small. 1 sock came completely without the grip on the bottom. Super cute and it’s nice how many you get.
3.0,"This product is decent.  A bit thinner fabric than what I was expecting. Also, the &#34;polo horses&#34; are all different colors...not just dark blue. But it's actually ok."
3.0,"Pearls had a purple cast so not exactly what I was expecting, but still nice."
3.0,"Capri Blue Camo, Size Medium (fits true to size):<br /><br />Although I somewhat appreciate the pattern and the construction of these capris, the fabric is a major disappointment.<br />Firstly, if you like the feeling of light compression or support, this fabric has neither. The fabric is soft and feels good on my skin, but it has zero support, & thus clings unflatteringly in places one would rather not having clinging when being active (such as at the crotch).<br />Secondly, when bending or stretching, these pants are not opaque. Basically, when the light hits you- as it tends to do at the gym- skin shows when you bend or stretch. As a fitness professional, this is a big no-no.<br />Thirdly, a couple of random things- the fabric is shiny and almost... sticky? It’s hard to explain without seeing and feeling it. Also, the capris gape a bit at the calves rather than clinging to my calves, which looks weird.<br />I am sending them back! Bummer, because I have a second pair coming which was shipped separately. Thumbs down."
3.0,"it was showing a lot of skin on the sides under the arm. it was flattering, but I ended up sending it back because I wasn't comfortable with the amount of skin showing. good for a beach coverup."
3.0,Great look and is exactly as pictured but I would say their size small is more along the lines of a size 6….
3.0,"I just wish you would put the wording on the back.  It may be a joke to you, but people are handicapped and it would be nice that they could alert other bikers that they are not able to move around as quickly as they are. Nice joke, but the handicap person should be able to tell the joke."
3.0,This material is not really as described. It is sheer and glittery and very short. I expected a jersey material instead of what was sent. I'd suggest this with leggings and not by itself.
3.0,I'm not sure these are actually polarized.
3.0,"The ring we received doesn't quite look like this picture. The thick middle section is a shiny black, not flat, and the outer edges are silver. However, my husband still likes it. For $15, we can't complain."
3.0,I loved the material! LOVED It! I didn’t like the zipper. It was very very plastic and cheaply made. My popped open at a youth retreat and I had to slip someone’s shirt on and run inside. I got to wear it a couple times and I loved it. Got a lot of compliments.
3.0,"this strap is paper thin, like im going to be very carefull with it to not break it, if you can be extremely carefull then buy."
3.0,"The quality was fine with the exception of one of the tops. One top had a defect and a hole about two inches on the side. Manufacturing defect, no stitching. I would have given this product a higher rating if the defect wasn't so noticeable."
3.0,The material is ok. I like the design but it's too big. I ordered small size but it's very loose. I will return it. I hope there is XS size.
3.0,Strong chemical odor. From China be sure to wash before you use
3.0,Not good for the triple letter cup girls.
3.0,"The earrings are way more dull than this picture makes you believe. They're still your average earrings, but if you're looking for something flashy, this isn't it."
3.0,The picture makes the sweats look fitted... Their more like hammer pants!
3.0,The shirt arrived in a timely manner.  Fits great.  Have had many compliments when I wear it.  Washed great also.
3.0,"This would be such a cute dress, but the fit is so odd! I'm confused as I did read the reviews very well and look at all the pictures, and none indicate that the bust is such an issue.<br /><br />I'm a size 8-10 and ordered a medium.<br />The waistline and skirt of this is so nice!<br />The top, not so much!! As you can see, my chest would be entirely exposed, and was even a bit loose. I can't see how it could be pinned to fix it. I'm a 36C and felt this dress made my boobs look huge, and not in a good way! I didn't like how it looks with a tank and certainly don't want to walk around exposed, so returned it.<br /><br />As others noted, there is no give to the fabric, so it felt a bit tight in the shoulders when reaching for something."
3.0,"I do not normally buy clothes on the line but couldn't find this particular style in any store so I gave it a chance. What a great fit. They fit perfectly on my hips, thighs and calves. The reason for the 3 stars is that I would purchase 3 additional pairs if they offered a bigger variance of other color options."
3.0,"Broke after a door handle tugged on it, but it lasted pretty long for the price. If you aren't going to make it a staple of your outfit, I'd say go ahead and get it. It's cute and decent quality for such a low price."
3.0,Way smaller than expected but it's cute
3.0,Got my pants today. They fit perfect can't wait to wear them for my man he loves white pants on me .
3.0,"I really like this hoodie. It is somewhat see through & the material is thin. It fits a little small, but it is really comfortable & cute."
3.0,Shoe pretty online but not when it made it disappointed
3.0,Velcro doesn't seem to stick the best on this wallet. Nice wallet otherwise for my grandson
3.0,"No kick pleat, I should have looked at the images better. Your stride will be shortened."
3.0,I love the colors but the sleeves fit a little tight.
3.0,"It fits and looks great, but it was a closer fit than I imagined and the waist is more of an empire than a natural waist. It is a flattering dress but I can also see some shrinkage from being laundered so I'm not holding out great hopes that this will last long. The green is also darker than expected- more hunter than kelly."
3.0,"Fits well.  Dont forget to tie it if it is a windy day as it doesnt really stay on your head otherwise.  But it is light, comfortable, and keeps your head from getting hot."
3.0,Pros- the quality of the material is very nice. Has good stretch and a nice fit.<br />Cons-the wording is off centered. And the lettering feels like it will not hold up very well. That is yet to be seen.
3.0,Didnt fit me but gave to someone else.
3.0,"These socks feel good and look good, but did not have much more compression than a regular pair of trouser socks.  I will be returning them, because compression is what I ordered them for."
3.0,The top is perfect and the reason I did not return this item. The pants are too small and so high waisted that they go up to my chest
3.0,Runs really rather small and isn't true to size.<br /><br />Item says plus size but it runs small. Their 2xl is like a large.<br /><br />Returned and won't be buying from this vendor.
3.0,"Was looking for a cotton bra. Cotton should be inside, as I truly don't care what's on the outside. The cotton was outside and the inside was synthetic, defeating the entire purpose of the cotton bra. I am afraid people who came up with this unique idea of making outside from cotton have no clue as to why we are looking for a cotton bra. Truly sad, because it's  a nice bra, but it irritates my skin limitlessly."
3.0,Be aware! Does not come with metal clips as described! Completely useless without them!
3.0,"I bought the white version first and loved it. I received so many compliments on this shirt and it really does look expensive. Great buy all around. I decided to buy another color, unfortunately it was a totally different experience. The black shirt looks and feels cheap and like it’s made of plastic. It’s shiny in a bad way and no way seems like the same shirt as the white."
3.0,A little small but fits
3.0,Way too short and the logo looks weird if you C+ cup size. It is super soft and cute regardless though
3.0,No stretch and EXTREMELY thick. No way can I wear in the summer! Runs small.
3.0,Not for tall people. Very short waisted.
3.0,Nice shoe but very nartpw
3.0,I got a larce. The pants fit but the shirt runs a little small
3.0,The plastic cover gets very foggy
3.0,Picture looks stretched and pixelated but still looks cool. The shirt fit perfectly! Very comfortable. Soft to the touch. Got a couple of smiles so far. Would I pay that much again…? Probably not.
3.0,"Unable to wear these at all.  I received a 42 which was way smaller than another pair of pants I am wearing now that are 40W.<br /><br />So I came back here to see whether there might be a larger size.  My vague recall is that 42 was the largest, but  I thought I would check for a 44.  BUT  The page says a 42 will fit me best, and there is NO WAY for me to look at any other size!  If I wanted to buy a pair of these for a smaller friend, it would be impossible to order them!!!!!  Really weird and annoying."
3.0,"It was smaller than I thought, but still wearable"
3.0,"Cute but are not exactly what I wanted. They squeeze my thighs and don't look that good on me, even though I have very toned thighs as I work out nearly every day. I'm 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs. Don't think I'll be wearing these often"
3.0,"Although cute, these glasses were not as pictured. The ones I received were bright red and were missing the gold bar on top. There is a slit on top for the gold piece to fit into and since it wasn't there, it was just an empty slit. Once my return is finalized I'm going to purchase again in a different color and hopefully receive what I ordered. Speaking solely on the quality of the glasses I thought they were what you'd expect for $12, and since I drop and lose everything that's pretty much my price range!"
3.0,"The overall fit of the dress was appropriate. However, the upper arm portion of the sleeve is quite loose. The dress falls right above the knee and has a tendency to pull backwards so that the midriff seam is lower in the back than in the front giving it more of an empire waist in the front than the back. The fabric of the dress is of thick quality but the printed flowers are not as vibrant as I was hoping for. It makes the quality of the fabric look cheaper than it truly is."
3.0,"I am giving this dress a 3 stars because the pockets really add weight to a girl's hips. The dress was fine and the color was great, but it was NOT flattering on my figure. For reference I am 5'8 (almost), 210 lbs, 38 D and 16 waist. Not for hippy girls."
3.0,"They fit well, appear to be durable, the drawstrings are better than most, my waist is 33-34 the large fit well. I wish they delivered next day.  I ordered more so clearly I like them."
3.0,It is more of an everyday bag vs a camera bag but for the price it will work. There is an additional padded insert provided which serves some protection but the Velcro pockets that came with the insert can easily come off depending on what you put in there. For limited use and transport I feel the bag will serve it's purpose.
3.0,The size is way too small in comparison to other cloth that I bought marked with the same size
3.0,"Love this bathing suit! So cute fits alright but the top could have been a bit bigger. Being a small girl with 34C, the top shows a lot of side boob. Bottoms fit great! Got a small. I'm 5'2&#34; and 115."
3.0,Not shown in the picture are tassels at the bottom.  I didn't like it at first but it is growing on me.  But now the tassels fall off easily.  Love the colors though!
3.0,It’s see through so wear dark under garments. I didn’t receive the belt that is shown in the picture.
3.0,"I like this watch band but I already had to replace it once after five months of use because the Velcro wore out. I really do like the band aside from that, which is why I ordered a second one however, If the Velcro fails as quickly as my first watch band I’ll look for a different one."
3.0,A little bit ugly
3.0,I dislike how after one day the two white hewles straight up fell out
3.0,Okay looking.
3.0,Cute but I didn't know the tree of life part was plastic
3.0,Not the one I was hoping for...the stable heel support for tennis.
3.0,To small for me so I ended up giving them to my younger sister
3.0,"THis is scarf is really cute and warm. The colors go well together. My only complaint is the &#34;fuzzies&#34; that come off of the scarf. It gets all over the place...my shirts, coats, it even gets in my contacts. I tried to wash it thinking that would help, but it didn't."
3.0,"The image on the tee is very blurry. Like it was enlarged from low resolution. I ordered the shirt 2 sizes larger and the fit was good. Also, the image is puckering after maybe 5 washes. Even turned inside out using cold water cycle when washed."
3.0,"I used to like these, and ordered a bunch last ueat, however thsi year they must've changed the sewing or something because the bottom sides are like sewn curved out, like it looked like flipped out corners on the bottom and makes it totally unflattering. Kinda dissapointed."
3.0,"Overall, the quality is pretty good and the pants fit as expected, but the design of the front pockets causes them to stick out on the sides. Looks like you're walking around with the pockets turned inside out."
3.0,"Too tight for a hefty 5'10"" man."
3.0,They do not stay in place very well.
3.0,These pants look like old man golf pants in person. They sure are loose and floppy.
3.0,"It looks fine and is comfortable. However, it was too small."
3.0,"Runs small, cute though."
3.0,"This dress is very cute and true to size but it is much shorter than it appears. I'm 5'4"" and it is just above my knees. I would have sent it back but it fits really well. If it wasn't for the length, I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,Cheap fabric good for a few weeks
3.0,way smaller for its stated size.
3.0,They are &#34;ok&#34;....they will be relegated to the bottom of the glove box.
3.0,Green rubs off on skin and clothing
3.0,More like a pajama top than a blouse.
3.0,"Band looks great but does not fit well. I understand leather takes a while to break in, but the clasps used to attach to the watch are bulky and uncomfortable. The claps also prevents the watch from sitting correctly on my wrist."
3.0,Idk if it was just a mistake but my son normally wears a 3t and the overalls are huge! I mean big enough that folding the bottoms wouldn’t help
3.0,The fit on the legs is great. Super cute jeans but around the butt area is loose and too low and falls.
3.0,love the look...but too tight. May stretch out after some wear. The lower sole ones were to loose. Great looking though.
3.0,Works as needed and the brim is wide and stays in place.<br />The only thing is that it gets discolored over time in the sun.
3.0,"Decent shoes, especially for the price we paid.  Like that they have L and R on the insides for trying to teach toddler left from right.  Like the generous width which makes the shoes easy to put on.  The negative is that the velcro doesn't stay closed very well resulting in the shoes sometimes coming off when they shouldn't."
3.0,Good value dry fit shirt pack and comfortable and doesn’t look and feel cheap.
3.0,"Nice material, but runs super small."
3.0,"This is a really nice top, i love the design and the color. My only problem was that it was basically a small T-shirt rather than a crop to to me, as some of the parts fit quite loosely. And if i bought a smaller size it wouldn't have fit."
3.0,"Loved this watch so much...easy on and off, great second hand function my job and pretty looking on the wrist. But it started to tarnish after 9 months of fairly constant wear. Have to look for replacement again."
3.0,"My daughter liked the dress, it did fit a bit small, however. But after washing a couple of times it looked old and wrinkles very easily."
3.0,Extremely thin. A shirt under it is needed.
3.0,Thin not denim fabric.
3.0,Didn't like the material.  Very thin t shirt material.
3.0,"Great 'Hooptie' watch!<br />Looks - 7 (Looks pretty good!)<br />Quality - 7 (Feels nice, snap clip was a little loose)<br /><br />Pro - Inexpensive, looks good, feels good, works<br />Con - Stop watch function hand doesn't line up perfectly straight up when reset.  It looks like it lines up to the first second when it resets to! So that makes it look like a cheap watch when you notice it!"
3.0,Cute shoes but they hurt my feet.  I can only wear them for a couple hours.  There is no support whatsoever.  They're cheap shoes that I got to go with a Grease costume so it got the job done but I had to change into other shoes after about 3 hours.
3.0,"This is a GREAT navy color, very dark. The applicator provided took up too much liquid and would soak through to the other side of the suede - it's better to use a cotton ball or something and a good pair of gloves. I dyed my shoes about 5 months ago, and the color has definitely faded since. Probably a good waterproofing application would bring back that deep color. In storing this, I left the container in a drawer and it fell on its side and completely drained all over (luckily it was a plastic tub drawer and didn't do much damage). I would like to see a better container for this product since I would have loved to use it again!"
3.0,"This keeps my neck completely covered, it’s light weight so you can hand wash, rinse and set out to dry easily. The reflective strips wear out easily"
3.0,Not sure if the delivery was a mistake but I thought it was supposed to be 4 pairs. I only got 2 pairs.
3.0,I don't care for the fabric.  Stays wrinkled.
3.0,"I wanted a dress I could wear with POCKETS. I'm 5'5"" 170 lbs and ordered XL, which might have been too large. This dress had now shaping so it didn't do anything for me - as in, if it doesn't accent me, then there's no point in wearing it. I ordered a vibrant orange, which could work, or does it just draw attention to the plainess of the shirt.<br /><br />The tassels are okay, but I wondered how long that would amuse me. The pockets exist...you could put a phone in there...but for me, the weight of the phone pulled the dress down. As I write this review, it is March in California. I think this dress would accent my armpit sweat in July.<br /><br />I considered ordering a different size, but the material, cost, and not-as-useful-as-I-hoped pockets convinced me otherwise.<br /><br />Main points: pockets aren't fantastic, the dress doesn't add much, and there is potential for sweat stains."
3.0,Fits great but came with lots of threads hanging off. Not pleased.
3.0,Well it was small for my american ear and it bends the top of my ear but i can do some adjusting by supergluing a cuff to fit my ear
3.0,THE top doesn't match the bottom as in the picture.
3.0,Very Nice Watch works well
3.0,The size was smaller than advertised
3.0,"Forgot to take pics, but if you're above a B cup & fit in the waist, this jacket won't do much to protect you from the cold. The inside is FLEECE so DO NOT DRY IN THE DRYER! Even low heat will cause this to pill & become itchy."
3.0,"Has anyone ordered this? And if so, has it tarnished, etc.? I want to give as a gift and would be embarrassed if its quality was poor."
3.0,This dark cognac color was in reality a strange orange color. The hardware is a bright brassy gold which screams cheap. That’s the bad parts. The good part is it fits everything I need in a daily basis. If it weren’t for the color and bright brassiness of the hardware this would be my go to clutch.
3.0,A little too big for my taste. They’re not as soft as I was expecting. Not terrible but I probably won’t buy another pair
3.0,Nice fit. It was delivered very quick.<br />I don't like the fact that it has no draw string around the neck part
3.0,"It was the style I expected, but the size was a little small and the color was way off. It was a much lighter blue (not dark at all) which unfortunately ruined it for me. Too late to return now, so I’ll make it work. Just be careful with the colors."
3.0,"I ordered a large because I don't like shirts that cling while I work out.  Also, to account for some shrinkage in the wash.  Unfortunately, it fits more like a medium size shirt than a large.  I can make it work but not what I wanted.  It's a cute shirt though."
3.0,This is a very cute top but the fit is small.  I’d say to up a size if you order it.
3.0,"I wear a med/large in tops and the small robe fit perfect for me. The only downside to this robe is the zipper, it’s made of plastic and is a pain to zip.  Worth the price I paid? Sure, but is not my go to robe."
3.0,This sixing was too small for what it said on the chart.
3.0,Nice tunic top bit very thin.
3.0,"Fun Halloween costume! My son is about 5 feet and this costume is a little too big for him. A lot of the aliens legs are bunched up around his ankles. However it still looks decent. My son says it’s comfortable to wear, not too hot. It does feel flimsy to me so hope it doesn’t tear before he even gets off our street."
3.0,"It’s not as beautiful as the picture’s, but it’s still pretty.  The chain is too long even it’s adjustable, but it doesn’t look good after adjusting it because of the nodes. Hope there is a video to show the product."
3.0,"Loved the suit. Decent quality for the price. Suit has circular pads in the bra that altered my shape. Unfortunately, had to return."
3.0,Way to many duplicates mostly girl designs and very little boyish designs
3.0,"Super cute, got tons of compliments when the lights were lit. Fit was great, put on over clothing, wasn't constricting at all. Battery pack over heated very quickly, the mechanism not the actual batteries. I brought extra batteries with me to change them out. The battery pack just wouldn't last more than 15 minutes before getting too hot to function properly, and then turned off. Had to wait for it to cool off before it would come back on."
3.0,"As always, I compare everything to the gold standard. For me, that is Maidenform. This doesn't measure up. It is quite decent, on a smaller woman, as the sizing is off, however, it is not as form fitting, structured or flattering. The flattening of a bit of, shall we say, fluff, around the midsection, is noticeable, but the effect requires having this fit far too tightly to be comfortable. Putting this on a smaller person, it just didn't smooth her out enough, but at least it fit her. I can't say it is worth the effort to get on and off, when a Maidenform would do the trick and be easier to use. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
3.0,They don’t fit very good they need to be made in wide with
3.0,"Just a little boxy, had to have it taken in at the waist. Not uncomfortable at all, the lining is polyester. I'm 5'10&#34; and had to take the hem out to make it long enough (size medium) but that's not too bad for someone my height, actually. I personally wish the color was more champagne than bright gold (but the bride actually preferred gold anyway.) The zipper is unnecessary for me, as it stretches a bit."
3.0,Too small but looks pretty
3.0,"Item arrived with one of the chains broken. I'm not going to send it back since I can fix it myself, but it would have been nice not to have to repair something that is supposedly new."
3.0,"cute small earrings, plastic, casual wear delivery was fast"
3.0,Looks good but...came without battery/ battery not working / broken
3.0,"Was a real pretty dress, nice color.  Runs very small, I'm 5'5"" 140 lbs and ordered Medium, runs very small. Returned as I didn't have time to get a bigger size."
3.0,It is a thin material. Not very firm but ok for a toddler.
3.0,"Nice quality, order a size smaller"
3.0,Color is light blue. Runs small.  Nice material. Better as night gown than as swim suit cover up
3.0,The hood wasn’t securely attached in one small area to the coat but I was able to attach it.  I was going to send the coat back but it was out of stock so I cancelled my return.  The fix I did isn’t noticeable.
3.0,Really too short fits more like a shirt
3.0,Followed other people’s review to order a size up but would just stick with my regular size next time. It’s still a cute cover-up for bathing suit or you Can  dress it up with a belt.
3.0,"The only thing wrong with it is that the chain feels flimsy. I feel like if it gets stuck on something it'll break. Otherwise its pretty, simple, and elegant with a cute shirt or a dress."
3.0,Got snookered again! Always read the description! Not a pair!
3.0,The wrist chain section is way too big.  I am going to have to modify it to make it work.
3.0,"I love these pants! Absolutely love them.. but I ran into an issue 😶<br />I'm 5' 6"" 155 lb, kinda wide hips.. I typically wear size 8-10 but (as always) I went up a size just in case and got the 10-12.. well, they were huge all around. So I returned them and got a size 8-10.. annnnd they're pretty stinkin' tight on my hips/waist.. I don't know if I'm defective or what lol but these pants need in-between sizes."
3.0,"Cute, looks as it appears in picture-just a tad small"
3.0,Love the color and style but the front is heavy and tips down. They look nice but a little disappointed with the fit.
3.0,Don't know if it works or not because my husbands giant grape is too big to fit it and I got the biggest size.
3.0,So what small in the hips
3.0,These were pretty cool. Until one of them broke while my groomsmen were puting them on before my wedding. The day was ruined. ;)<br />Everyone loved them and thought they were a cool twist to the wedding attire. It was hard to find affordable Star Wars cuff links. So these definitely met the criteria for being inexpensive so I guess I could expect one of them to break while putting them on.<br />These are the cuff links you're looking for.
3.0,"i tried washing the foot since it looked like dirt or rabbit poop on it , but it seems like tar. not enough time to enchange, so kinda sorry about that!"
3.0,"I love the case but the reason I purchased it was because it had a small bottle I could put my solution in.  This allows me to just grab the whole case and I am good to travel or just change out purses. However, the bottle for the solution is so cheap it won't seal. It is crap.  I would happily give the kit 5 stars if not for the cheap crappy bottle.  All they had to do was make a screw top and all issues would be settled. Otherwise, cute case."
3.0,Solo bueno.
3.0,Charm nice. I returned necklace because chain was like a chain link fence. Very masculine.
3.0,Much smaller in person the leaf is NOT as large as it appears.
3.0,it's just a lil small that's it
3.0,I order a medium and it was very big on me so i am assuming this product runs big
3.0,"Fabric is nice; however, I ordered a small and it's pretty long. I'm 5'5 and it goes past my knees."
3.0,They are very small and child size.  Should have better description.
3.0,"Cheap, uncomfortable fabric and too small. I would not buy again or recommend for anyone else to buy."
3.0,Single use and it already ripped. To expensive for what you get.
3.0,"I was expecting these pants to be less flared at the lower leg. I know that it said straight leg, but it feels more like boot cut. Otherwise these pants fit well & are comfortable"
3.0,Worked fine as a Wonka costume. It's more like a sweater than a jacket but made the effect I was looking for
3.0,When we got it it says YL on the package witch is youth large and it does not say that in the discription. Other than that it is nice
3.0,"All those colors and yet nothing matches. Also, one of the bands broke the first time I used it."
3.0,Nice material but wierd fit. Order at least a size smaller than you normally wear. Not bad for the price.
3.0,"This dress is super flattering and really cute. However, it is very very short. At least on me it is. It is a long shirt for me which is still cute. I’m 5’3 and this dress was one sneeze away from showing everyone the goods."
3.0,"This case is cute, but offers no protection from drops.  It will only protect from scratches."
3.0,"Decent socks, but the elastic is pretty loose, and the sock tend to sag a bit. The fabric is nice, and the price was good, but I'm not a fan of droopy socks."
3.0,"This runs very small. I normally wear a small shirt, I am 5""1' and weigh 114 with large C cup. I ordered a small and it is very snug.  Also, the front rouging on the chest isn't symmetrical so it looks a little funny.  The shirt quality seems good and thick but way too tight."
3.0,"I bought these for my 12 year old(she doesn't like the style) and possibly myself. I have a small head and I would not be able to wear them. My 10 year old can. I love the look of these masks, they do NOT pass the candle test and do NOT have an opening for a filter. I cut a hole and placed a filter between the 2 layers. We will see how they hold up. The black rubber adjusters that came with them will work to adjust size but NOT for the wide ear strap on THESE masks."
3.0,Cute for sure but did not fit around the shoulders comfortably at all ):
3.0,Ring broke after one week of wearing.
3.0,"I am a size 7.5 so I ordered medium (size 7-8) noting most reviews said they ran small, but they are so big they are slipping off my feet. Now I'm seeing many reviews that say the slippers run too small. I think the sizing might be different for each slipper made! Or the company is not sizing them correctly or labeling them correctly - something is off for so many people to have so many different problems with sizing. For that reason I gave them 3 stars. They seem cute and comfy though and had they fit right probably would have given a 4-5."
3.0,"Cute, but I can’t trust them to stay closed. I worry that I will loose them."
3.0,"This costume is fun overall, but none of it is great quality. If you wear any of these items more than once or twice, I feel like they'd fall apart pretty immediately. It's worth it if you want a cute, disposable costume to wear to a theme party, but don't expect to get much wear out of anything if you're trying to integrate pieces into a regular ""spicy"" costume rotation. Also, the wig features the single worst closure I've ever seen. It's just...wow. You'll need that lacy headband to cover the nightmare of felting on the top of your head!"
3.0,Wasn't impressed by  this item very poor quality.
3.0,Not as spectacular as in the photos
3.0,"I liked the look of it, but you have to assemble it, it has tiny parts that I didn’t know where they go. It is very uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"Sorry, I should have taken a photo. This is a cute coverup, but the size 3-6 is way too big for little kids. My 4-year old could hardly keep it from falling off her shoulders when she was just standing there. I had her take a few steps and it fell down right away. I like the loose fit, but the head hole is too big, and it falls right off shoulders. Unless you have a stocky kid with broad shoulders, this isn’t going to stay put."
3.0,"Great fit and comfy, but definitely see through."
3.0,"Pretty dress, but looks different than the photo online."
3.0,It runs SMALL<br />Ok now that's out the way<br />The material is nice and good quality<br />It's a good buy but just keep in mind it runs SMALL
3.0,"Cheap NATO straps that are durable and pretty well made. For the money, I don't think you can go wrong."
3.0,This is a super cute outfit but it seems way too big for the size I ordered. Luckily I bought it for my friends baby shower so hopefully she can still take advantage.
3.0,Not my favorite shirt but its comfy and I probably will use it to sleep in.
3.0,HATE THE MATERIAL
3.0,Good shirt he liked it
3.0,I loved them until the back came undone and I lost it. My first pair this size so I don't have a replacement
3.0,Good but very fragile.
3.0,"The feathers are very pretty and kind of shine in the light. With that said, it is a strip of feathers on a ribbon! Not a shrug which is what I was expecting. I was able to put it on easily and it looks exactly as pictured. The feather seem to be sewn on, so hopefully it won’t fall apart when i wear it. Party is in a few weeks so we shall see. I’m going to keep it, but it is very expensive for what it is."
3.0,"This is for home use only, the wanna do it your self person who is going to use it 3-4 times in their lifetime. It’s made of cheap super light weight plastic and the two link pin drivers are soft metal and bend real easy. Using this link remover will most likey scuff your bracelet. Good luck"
3.0,"The small was tight on me (130lbs, 5'5"" normal dress size- 4) but was very cute, the fabric was thick and high quality. Pretty sad it didn't fit."
3.0,Size seven is what i wear always and I even remeasured as well and it's too tight and cheap looking
3.0,they broke on the first day
3.0,It's just okay. The fabric is horrible but the purple is very pretty
3.0,"I was hoping they were going to be a lot smaller than what I received. These charms are large enough to be brooches, they are also incredibly heavy, so making earrings with them is not suggested. Granted there are a few of them that I was able to make jewelry with, but the rest of them are too big."
3.0,Color is a little darker and size is a little large.  I haven't washed them yet.  Good quality for price.
3.0,"Really really loved this watch when I first got it but after 2 weeks of wear, the little strap that holds down the other strap broke :(("
3.0,"On the thin side.  giving for a Christmas gift, hope the person likes it."
3.0,"video quality is good. operation system is a little numb, response with pause. screen is not quite sensitive to finger poke, unless with some effort. the idea of lock the file when car is having extra 'g', which may be caused by sudden accident is great, but tech is not good enough to realize this idea. moving with hand, put it down to table all cause it feels there is an accident and start recording or lock the files. the sd card is soon full and have to use some method to delete those 'locked' file. feels a little inconvenient."
3.0,"The sunglasses are exelent quality,  but are not the same color as the picture,  not pink, those are brown"
3.0,Too clingy/thin and short for my taste. The dress looks more purple than deep blue in person. I returned it hassle free.
3.0,"The print is beautiful. Good construction. But just doesn't fit. I am a small woman.4' 11', 108 lbs(size 6-8, I can wear small jersey but prefer medium for a looser fit) The recommendation was to order 2 sizes up. So I ordered an XL. Too tight everywhere. The company graciously sent a XXL. Shoulders fit but hip elastic too tight and jersey is too long. I gave it 3 stars because it is beautiful and I really like it but just can't wear it."
3.0,"Fit a bit snug, also there is a logo on the lens which is not shown in the picture.I used nail polish remover to take logo off."
3.0,"I absolutely love it, but too big on me & the zipper gets stuck :("
3.0,Too long and do it kept turning on my wrist because I couldn’t get it tight enough.
3.0,"Cute, colorful, and comfortable. No funny smells. Easy to wash. Just a bit too large for my small head."
3.0,"What I disliked about these bras is that IT DOES NOTHING FOR A FULLER BUST! Its a comfortable wear to be around the house, sleep or outside with a jacket, but nothing I would wear to go running...the inside cups are a nice touch."
3.0,"Not great quality, front in fine sleeves are weird"
3.0,Nice shirts but the sizing chart is really bad!!! I had to return all mine.
3.0,"Not what I expected, looks way better in the picture"
3.0,It doesn’t feel like it protects me from sweat dripping on my face. The material is very thin and with my very intense workouts it’s enough for me to keep the sweat from hair and my face.
3.0,Pretty but couldn't set the time.
3.0,Fits somewhat small but very cute.
3.0,"it is smaller than I anticipated, so, You can't get much inside it"
3.0,These are cheap and not very big
3.0,Very light weight shirt that's also very soft. Will wrinkle if left in a ball in the laundry basket but will unwrinkle itself over time. The bad part is there's a lot of transparent threads that have come up around the inside shoulder area that are bothersome and I haven't used the shirt very often so don't know how good the quality actually is.
3.0,"I'm happy with it, but just want to warn people that the turqouise is much more green (which I actually really wanted), and can be somewhat large, so if you think you might have to go a size up- DON'T, maybe even go a size down."
3.0,Seemed shorter than I expected
3.0,If you need to larger size then this won’t fit well
3.0,They are OK but cheap....lace is a bit &#34;in-soft&#34; so I went to Macy's and paid that much for one piece....much softer.
3.0,"I expected it to be a soft pastel baby pink color like in the photo but instead it's more of a fuchsia, the quality of the hat was still quite good for the price,but the color was an absolute deal breaker for me so I returned it."
3.0,Would like to of seen the design on both sides.
3.0,It’s very comfortable. And soft And I like the color.
3.0,This is a great weekender bag. The only thing I didn’t like about it is the shoe compartment. If you put a pair of sneakers in there it takes up a lot of space in the bag itself which limits the amount of items to can place into the bag.
3.0,Great quality and colors! My daughter complains the waistband area is itchy.
3.0,"I love the shape, style and size... but the background of the cards is a dingy yellowish color. I'd give it 5 stars if the cards were a bright white."
3.0,Much smalller than the original of which I have every color...that's why I ordered the orange.  So hoping they go back to the original size...
3.0,Very cute. Just like the photo but I only got 5.  Not 6 pairs.  1 was missing
3.0,Fabric a little sloppy in fit
3.0,"Love the design, but the silver wore off in less than a week and now it's two toned of silver and a bronze color.  Would be much nicer if it would stay all silver."
3.0,"These pads probably work well for some. They stick well to some eyeglass surfaces (unfortunately not mine), and the opposite side is a rough surface designed not to let the glasses slip down your nose and fall off (unfortunately, not rough enough to stick to my nose). (Note to self: Next time you get a nose fracture, have it repaired, so glasses don't fall off your nose, thus requiring the services of these pads, which didn't solve the problem well for you.)"
3.0,My wife is usually a Medium but occasionally large so I got Large. The long set fit well but the short set was way too big so it just wasn’t consistent.
3.0,The material was a bit scratchy. Not the typical soft spandex of other leggings..
3.0,Leather tore after a month
3.0,"This dress was quite long. I am 5' 2"" and it came to almost my ankles. It is also very low cut, such that it needs pinning if you don't want your bra to show. It's also a bit matronly with the all-over lace. Pretty, but just not my style. Returning."
3.0,"Good quality leather shoe but waaaaayy to big. I ordered a women’s size 10 & was sent a 44, so it felt like an 11."
3.0,"I ordered a small, as usual, I had to have it altered.  I am 5’5, I consistently have to shorten the dress, this is the second dress I’ve ordered.  It’s annoying, an extra cost.  I love the fit, that’s the only reason I buy Patty Boutik.  Stop making them so long!"
3.0,"I give it a three Bc I bought these for my daughter who loves red, ruby. They are very pretty. My problem is the post is quite long. With the back on it tight the end pokes the head behind her hair. When it’s loose it looks like the earring is falling off."
3.0,La tela se arruga con mucha facilidad
3.0,The chain breaks easily and it arrived late but it’s decent
3.0,"I like that these earrings are small and cute, but the back of the earrings has lost its luster and can only be refunded"
3.0,"I usually love Loungelfy and while this is a cute design and I love it, I find it hard to use. The card slots on the vertical part don't have any ""catch"" so to speak, so it's super easy for your cards to get lost in the deep pocket. If it wasn't for this (major) design flaw it would be 5 stars easily."
3.0,They are very cute but package arrived and the backs were bent almost broken☹️
3.0,"The scarf looks exactly as pictured for me (I ordered the Khaki/Orange). I like the scarf, but it smells horrible; there is a very strong chemical smell. It definitely needs washing before I attempt to wear it again."
3.0,These are great except they roll off of your thighs once you start moving:).
3.0,Some of the colors were really strange so I'm not sure most of them will ever match anything.  The flowers were also falling apart of some of them and I could see the felts they were glued onto.
3.0,Nice color but thin and not wide
3.0,For a basic watch it will do. The band does not look like it would last very long. But for the price you can't really complain.
3.0,Kind of cheap feeling. Get snagged on my skothes.
3.0,Good quality and style. Way too small
3.0,nice but too big
3.0,"I ordered this months ago. It took longer than expected to arrive. I didn't realize it was coming from China since it was labeled PRIME. I order directly from China via another site and usually get my items in 3 weeks - maximum. This top took forever to arrive. During the time I ordered it and the time it arrived, I lost weight (shout out to WW). The only reason I mention the weight loss is because if I hadn't lost the weight the top would've looked a Hot Mess! I'm now at 164 and I ordered an XL. When I ordered the top I was at 193, if I was still that size, that top would've shown all my Business, I'm way too old for that! It's an odd material, its all wrinkled and balled up when it arrives. I ironed it with a pressing cloth and wore it with a regular bra with clear straps (clear straps can be purchased on Amazon as well). It's kinda cute, but in my humble opinion not made for busty women."
3.0,"So, the pants were too tightly squeezing at the waist line and the top was too loose & in turn unflattering for either article. It's too bad bc it's a cute fit, and I've got a fairly standard body type and size."
3.0,The top and fit of this dress is cute. However the slit is not just your usual slit. Rather than adding fabric so the line of the slit lines up with the buttons they folded back so you end up with horseshoe looking slit. Too bad cause aside from that it's cute. But the slit is bad enough that it's going back.
3.0,The skirt is nice material is too thin
3.0,Nice lil shirt but a xxl fits like a medium
3.0,It's a very fitted style and clingy.  Unfortunately my body doesn't go well with something this fitted.
3.0,The applicator sponge became unattached to the handle on first usage; I didn't use the polish but did use the brush for polishing. The brush was small but did a fine job polishing.  I liked that a clear leather cream was included for other colors besides black. This would be a good kit for travel and touchups.
3.0,"I’m 5’8”, 160lbs, 30in waist and 42in hips, usually wear size 10 pants. To be fair, I’m in between a large and medium and went with a large for length. This is just so flowy so it runs large. I like the colors and the material is perfectly thin for a summer dress. It’s just so big that I think I’ll have to return it for a smaller size. Oh, and the neck line is super weird. The straps are more towards the shoulders which I don’t think is very flattering. But again, that could be the sizing issue."
3.0,I like bag but it is a little too big for everyday use...more like a carryon bag. Half the size would be fine.
3.0,Very cute just runs small. Way to short for me.
3.0,the outfit is very cute but definitely too big. My nephew will not be able to wear his outfit until he is like 2 years old.
3.0,"great for the money, but its made of plastic lens that is alittle cloudy  and it is already starting to fall apart"
3.0,They arrived very quickly. Only thing i didnt care for was the smallness. However its expected when you order this kind of stuff online.
3.0,Very solid but really hard to push in without a hammer.. also really hard to take out. I try them in my lawn so..
3.0,Not exactly the way I was hoping it would be.  Looks extremely cheap and dirty.
3.0,I really liked everything about this except the length. Cute for summer
3.0,This is ok. The first time I wore it my wrist turned gray. I will try putting clear nail polish on the inside to see if that helps.
3.0,"I take between a large and an extra large. I ordered the xxl because that was the largest size they offered, but it was too small. These require taking about 3 sizes larger to get close to a proper fit."
3.0,"Really cute and good quality, but runs really small. Other 2T suits are almost too big on my daughter, but this one was so tight I had to return it."
3.0,see the thing is it should be easily deployable... else this survival bracelet is of no use.
3.0,"Material is too cheap, 2x like an xl"
3.0,The mustard colored sweatshirt isn't as dark as the picture shows.  It's more a lighter yellow.
3.0,Cute dress but way to snug
3.0,The dress was for my teen daughter who is a size 10/12 and the large was too big.
3.0,Cute but super dull. No shine like the photo.
3.0,These were washed in cold then dryed in dryer should hang dry they shrunk considerably.
3.0,"Shiny and beautiful, but HEAVY as all get out!  Earrings are junk, but crown is decent"
3.0,"The dress is pretty, but I guess my 36c chest is just to small for the top. I was popping out of it. It was snug everywhere else, but there. I no way could face gotten away with wearing it."
3.0,I did not care for the material. I was expecting a t-shirt material and this was not.  It was pretty and fit well.
3.0,"It was funny, and my girlfriend got a kick out of it.  But one there are a few problems.<br /><br />1. The buttons on the shorts are not well attached.  I popped a button off within five minutes.<br />2. The neck/tie is way too loose.  Like, crazy loose.  Admittedly, I'm a small guy (6'0&#34; and 165 lbs), but wow.  I used a few bobby pins to hold it in place.<br />3. The tie is poorly attached.  A few bobby pins will hold it in place, otherwise it's just flopping around.<br />4. The cuffs are super loose.<br /><br />I bought the Small size and it fit me well with a 32&#34; waist.<br /><br />All that said, I'll probably reuse the shorts again, but the rest is too low quality to bother with."
3.0,Don’t like how the fabric feels. Looks exactly like shown. Daughter still loved it.
3.0,"I assured my friend who  told me this dress would not fit that it would. I just had a dress made from my measurements at Christmas... and they had not changed.<br />Wow... was I wrong. The 3X I ordered fit like an XL... I couldn't even get it completely on. I worked it out with the seller and ended up giving it to a friend of mine who is smaller.<br />It is a nice dress and both she and her husband love her in it.  The 3 stars I'm giving the dress is really for the totally inaccurate size chart, not the actual dress."
3.0,Not easy to walk in.  Too much wriggle room...sad
3.0,Really excited to use this. Well made but way to big for golf bag. Had to return.
3.0,Ordered the XL 9.5-10 for my mom for Xmas. They fit my 8.5 feet instead.  Bummed because there wasn’t any information that they fit small.
3.0,"These will be a good cheap addition to my vacation show stockpile.  I don't expect them to last for years, but if you need some sandals for one season, these will absolutely work."
3.0,Very big for my face
3.0,Timex certainly could have done better with their lume. It is a stainless watch though. The crystal looks cheaper. I wasn’t expecting sapphire but this looks like plastic and not hesslite.
3.0,I thought there would be more variation of colors and it is a lot less full than the picture shows. The packaging was terrible. The hat was squished into the box that was too small. The brim had to be folded up in order to fit and the box wasn't tall enough. I'm not sure if I'll ever wear it
3.0,I loved this dress I'm a sizec2-4.  But because  I'm a D in breast.  I returned  it. Nice quality  just get a bra that matches the color.
3.0,This bathing suit is not at all flattering. Good for hiding your mid section and fit was somewhat small.
3.0,So so quality--one arrived totally disconnected
3.0,"I've ordered several of these tops in various colors. This pink and white one was alittle disappointing. Fit is fine but the arm buttons are black as opposed to clear on the other colors. Not that nice on a summery pink and white top. Plus it's higher up on the arm which makes the sleeves more like tight short sleeves instead of 3/4 length. That's my bad because the picture shows the short sleeve length but other colors of same top have the clear buttons lower down and makes sleeves look better and are the flattering 3/4 length. Point being, there is quite a variance in these tops that seem to all look the same in styling but have differences among them. Seller was great though!"
3.0,"Too short, not even knee length. When I saw the name Modest I thought somewhat covered."
3.0,"Runs big, bought a small but should have gotten xs"
3.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and I swim in these. Not for petites.
3.0,I ordered this for my sister because it looked like a “pop” I wear frequently.  Just be aware that it does not have a glossy finish so it looks like wood rather than stone.  It looks OK but not what I expected.
3.0,3T came in looking like a 5T. Had to return rather than exchange because they didn’t have 2T.<br />Stitching was also defective on collar.
3.0,I love the look of these but they feel weird on my face. Several other friends tired them as well but they concluded the same. They are definitely pretty cool but I wouldn’t recommend wearing them all day
3.0,More yellow than pictured. The bottom is tighter than pictured but good feel to the fabric.
3.0,"Thus is a really nice looking band, but after 2 months of wear, the pattern is coming off it. Kind is defeats the purpose of buying a cute band."
3.0,Looks good wasn't expecting the cloth upper part that makes up 80% of the neck line. Perhaps it was in the description but I didn't see it. Overall a good fit and comfortable.
3.0,I did not like the size.  The glasses are nice.
3.0,"Earrings are pretty enough but brassier in color than I would have liked. The catch on them is very awkward and not comfortable to put in, curved (facing back of your ear) part is hard to get through the piercing. Got one in this morning and after fiddling w/ the other side for about 2-3 minutes, gave up & back in jewelry box. Maybe I'll try again or maybe not, want jewelry to go on easily, stay on til I remove it without too much fuss."
3.0,It was a good product until it broke here I am almost a month later waiting on my refund that they still haven’t send back and they receive the return on August 22 and today is September 11
3.0,"Pretty laces, but too big for the shoes I wanted to use these laces on. Using them on something else & they're pretty."
3.0,"Pretty and stamped with 925.  I'm allergic to nickel and after reading other reviews I was a bit skeptical,  but I've worn it a lot since I received it and so far no issues."
3.0,Poorly made. Seems did not match up and the dress did not lay well!
3.0,I disliked that there is a prominent gold zipper up the side of the jeans on one side. Not shown in picture.
3.0,This is a very warm coat and comfortable to wear. The zipper is sewn on as if it were a woman’s coat
3.0,"The dress falls off the shoulders so I had to wear a strapless, also I kept having to pull it down so it would sit properly."
3.0,"I was hoping these would help my plantar fasciitis.  They compress all over, but didn't have a band to support the arch as I'd hoped.  They are decent to wear on walks but not very comfortable around the house or wearing all day."
3.0,"The pros: the price is right and it goes with everything. It's a very versatile piece. I've worn it three times in the six (or so) days that I've owned it.<br />The cons: the stone itself is a perfectly uniform color, which makes it seem fake. It just looks too perfect. And the gold looks fake too.<br />Overall I'm glad I own this, and glad it was cheap, but I don't expect it to last long."
3.0,"When I tried to open the package, carefully, the socks were packed so tightly that the scissors sliced into the toe of one, ruining one pair, even though I was specifically trying to avoid doing this. I have arthritis right now, so there is no other way for me to open things. I've downgraded my review even more since the seller didn't bother to respond to my email complaining about this.<br />=====UPDATE=====<br />Well the seller did get back in touch recently and promises to send another pair. Better late than never. The socks are basically very good and have worn well and if I get my third pair I'll update bump up my review again."
3.0,"Bought for my son. Have to cut it and put another string on it, because it is so small, it wouldn't fit on a 2 year olds head to go on his neck. He couldn't wear it at his birthday party :/"
3.0,Poor Quality control had missing screws on faceplate
3.0,The print is a lot bolder than i thought.
3.0,"Love this dress, but had to return as it was just really large and strange fitting. I'm 5'3, 130lbs, DD breasts. Ordered a small and it was too big."
3.0,I love the ring/weight n the design… it had a sharp point catching everything n scratched me but smoothed it out it was fine … haven’t taken it off sense I received it…now as of  02/28/22 my thumb is green 🤷‍♀️? Not happy about that… I would love to have a ring like this that’s not going to turn my finger green🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️… Hope you can do something about this … it would be wonderful to have one I can ware n never take off🤷‍♀️
3.0,Item description said single flare. These are double flare. Image is pretty.
3.0,"Very nice quality & very pretty. It’s exactly what I wanted, would 100% recommend.<br /><br />Update: After having the jewelry for a short period of time BOTH clickers have broken, one within the first use! (I’m not hard on my jewelry either)"
3.0,"I ordered a small black. Didn’t know it would come with a pouch but it did. When I first put it on, the glasses looked bent in on me so I had to bend it to the desired look. I was afraid I would break it cause I knew I would if I put enough force into it but I went slow with it. I don’t rest it all the way up, I rest it where my eyes are over the glasses for style and mainly because the lens gives me a headache. I wear my contacts with this and looking through the lens, it seems cheap and blurry. After I adjusted everything though and figured out how I should wear it comfortably, I think it looks really cute. I know people are worried about the sizing and all that but for me personally, the small is the perfect size. Anything too big would just take over my whole entire face."
3.0,"Chain is not as pictured, cheaper looking chain than what is pictured. Pendent as pictured"
3.0,It's cute but the fabric is not very soft and it wrinkles a lot!
3.0,I love these pieces I just wish they were bigger! The pic didn’t show the size correctly. That’s the only thing I would change. Other than the size I love them! Found this stone a few months ago and it’s quickly turning into one of my fav!
3.0,"Really liked these…..however we already lost one, the closures are not great, we had both come off several time during the first week we had them, now we only have 1."
3.0,"These fit as expected.  Loose fitting an fell past the knees as shown.  Waist fits high, almost to the belly button.  It was hard to roll down because it is a thin little elastic strip.  The material was satin like, but a little stiff.  I hope they soften with washing.  The lace parts were like cardboard.  I chose to shorten mine because they were so stiff and scratchy on my knees.  Pulling the stitch out to shorten them was a joke, unless you have a magnifying glass and the patience of Ghandi.  I just cut the top ring of lace.  That worked fine and they did well enough for the day.  I feel that I also was a lot HOTTER in these, than without.  My thighs did not get the rubbing irritation that they would have without, but I believe a better quality, more expensive product similar to this would work.  Overall, i am glad that I bought these, if anything, just to try and see if the concept would work prior to spending more  $$.  And, they are HIDEOUS on.  My husband laughed and laughed when he saw these.  But I did not buy them for looks, just for comfort."
3.0,"I usually wear a Women's Size 14 shirt - sometimes Large, sometimes XL, depending on the style.  I ordered an XL so it would be loose and comfortable for yoga.  I assumed it was a Womens XL as the model is female.  When it arrived, the packaging said ""Mens XL.""  When I tried it on, it was skin tight.  Sizing must run at least 2 sizes small."
3.0,Good for 1 day ripped within half a day wearing it
3.0,"These are not compression shirts. Had I ordered smaller,  they just would have been shorter. Not of fan of them springing up constantly either."
3.0,"Hi.  While the belt's design is really cool, I found it too wide to be really comfortable.  I was told that a thinner belt is in the works and I will probably try that when its available."
3.0,Not soft fabric
3.0,One of these quit working soon after installation.  The remaining one doesn't seem to be very sensitive.  I am doing car aerobics to find the spot where it works to open/close the door.
3.0,"We keep these bags in our car for when we shop.  They are compact, sturdy and hold a lot.  The only disadvantage is that they are hard to keep open while loading.  It's not a great problem, so overall we are satisfied."
3.0,"I love the fit, it is perfect in that sense. The edges of the squares were quick to start fraying, though."
3.0,"The idea is cute, but it fits big. Snagged easily."
3.0,"Super cute, they seem to be really comfortable actually. However I usually wear 7 1/2 to 8 and ordered an 8 and my toes pretty much hang off which is disappointing. :( I love the style and they look just like the picture color wise. Will be returning but will be ordering again a 1/2 size up!"
3.0,I wear size 14 bought xl fits like size 10 cant even button or zip
3.0,"IT looks pretty good, but very small"
3.0,It's a little too small and I didn't think about the face of the bracelet.  You can't engrave anything on the front because of the heart.
3.0,Material is low quality .. feel like it'll be gone in one wash
3.0,"the price shows in the quality.<br />It's a bit small and the band is thinner than you'd expect from the photo. It also warps easily. I expect this to eventually break from metal fatigue<br />But for the price, it isn't awful"
3.0,There not as long as the picture shows they barely go past my kids chins
3.0,"It's a nice shirt but it's not as loose as it appears, nor is the v-neck that deep. I'm going to keep it because it doesn't look so bad, but it's nothing like the photo"
3.0,Really large lightweight bag!
3.0,Super cute but the zipper was messed up and the skirt fabric was super thin. I returned it.
3.0,"I liked the dress, but it wasn't true to size. Not even close ! I was so upset, I asked for an extra large. When I got it, I couldn't get it over my chest. I gave it to a friend at work that wears a 2. IT fit her fine so no way it would fit me !"
3.0,"This tie is 3.25 inches wide, not 3.5."
3.0,Beautiful silver chain.<br /><br />***Update 07-21-16***  After only a few months the chain snapped. I wore it everyday with a religious medal on it. I suppose if you are going to wear this chain alone and only occasionally it would be nice. But for anything else it is too delicate.
3.0,"I have purchased 12pc for my workers in the farm, the size is larger than average, in addition the all came without adjusting strap (on the back side) as shown on the product pic, quality is good though"
3.0,"I like the dress, what I don't like is that the cut line instead to be in the back is at the front and that make looks the dress wire, that's is the reason I don't wear very much this dress."
3.0,"The pearl was a lot bigger than it appears in the picture, it was out it proportion to the chain"
3.0,"The quality of the wires is good (sturdy with coated ends), but I expected the length of a size ""B"" wire to be a standard size.  I was wrong.  These wires are several inches longer (about 4"" longer) than a standard B wire."
3.0,"So, yes these are warm and I do use them on the coldest of days but I really don't like them because i think they are ugly. I suppose if you want them for warmth yes but if you are going for style...no way."
3.0,I ordered a larger size for my son and their still too small. Im hoping to get a pair that actually fits him. Their great shoes with the exception to sizing
3.0,"I like the pants, BUT less than a day of wearing them and already my pocket is ripping open. Too bad. Very comfy otherwise."
3.0,"Nice tie, skinnier than I was hoping, but still a nice tie and great value for the price."
3.0,"I ordered the medium color, received them, absolutely love them. Since I liked them so much, I ordered the darker color. It took almost a month to receive them, and when I did they were absolutely nothing like the other pair, in regards to quality feel and fit."
3.0,Love these rings but it runs way too small. I already have petite fingers and it’s too tight for my ring finger.
3.0,"I think this chain is fine for the prize. it really looks like authentic gold. the only issue I had was that whenever you wearing it, it folds in a weard way."
3.0,Super cute but I have small head and this hat is huge.
3.0,Despite the reviews the cost didn’t work for me. The sleep were at least 3 inches too short and the belt hit me too close too close to “the girls”. I measured before I bought but it was still off according to their chart.
3.0,"Directions they send are hard to see and are not in English- difficult to assemble unless you watch the YouTube videos posted by others on how to assemble. Also, after one wear one of the pieces has already broken, so I'm not convinced this is good quality material. On the plus side the description and pictures are accurate, sizing fit well."
3.0,Upset I already have to sew it back together
3.0,Darker green than pictured.
3.0,"For the price, these are good shoes.  I haven't had a chance to wear mine for any amount of time, but when I have worn them, there is no rubbing any place on my feet and they feel good.  They will be a good addition to my summer shoe wardrobe."
3.0,"Wore them and searched my truck thinking maybe trash was somewhere. Nope! Glasses smell like they’ve been in a trash can or made from trash. Cleaned them with alcohol. Still smelly! Tried it again, no change. Tried with scrubbing bubbles. Unsure. Have to wait over 24 hrs to see bc alcohol worked but next day they smelled so bad AGAIN!! 🤮"
3.0,I like this set but the color is off but it fits great!
3.0,"These run very small. They aren't for tall girls. They are also thick and shiny. They are the sort of leggings that will make you feel sweaty. If you buy them, buy a size up."
3.0,"Pattern is off, doesn't fit right."
3.0,Color is not as pictured. More blue than green. Material is a bit stiff.
3.0,the black Timberland sweatshirt size18/20 is more like a 14/16.  the ivory one is a true 18/20.
3.0,Beautiful glasses but also too heavy ;-(
3.0,"I ended up returning. The delivery was fine. The design was really cute. Unfortunately, the seams were coming undone and squares not completely lined up straight."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:a196b29a1d3153b7b3193ece44388dbc]] Esta bonito salió bueno lo único es que suena muy duro
3.0,"We needed these masks to complete our bandit costumes for Halloween and it did only that. These masks were so itchy and tight! I could only keep it on for minutes at a time. My eyes felt like they were being squeezed into the eye holes. The masks are well constructed. If I may make a suggestion, I think the mask string should come with more slack so the buyer can adjust as needed. Also, it would help if the eye holes were about an inch wider on each side. Other than that, it got the job done."
3.0,The color shown in the picture was not the color I received. The dress I received was significantly lighter than expected. The dress itself fits well.
3.0,"Looks more like 2nd image than the first one, still looks good though."
3.0,"It was really tight in the crotch, visibly tight."
3.0,Way too small. Wife normally wears a med and these were too small to put on almost.
3.0,"The material is polyester of some kind. There is zero cotton or linen to this dress.  Order up 1-2 sizes.  I got the blue with flowers and it is very pretty, just not what I was expecting at all.  Also there aren't any tags, so I'm unsure of how to clean it."
3.0,"While it's good for the price and the package arrived promptly (Amazon Prime), the quality of the skirt didn't satisfy me. It was really thin and easily wrinkled and the knot didn't seem as natural as shown in the photo."
3.0,"Good value because the price is so low.  They run a little small and the thing that goes between the toes is rough and too wide making them uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.  I only need them for the shower so they're ok.  If I had paid more than usd 10, I would be disappointed."
3.0,Really nice shoes but run way to small... they have nothing to do with EU or US sizes...
3.0,Beautiful necklace but I ordered a M and instead I got a K 🥺
3.0,"For the price, I wasn’t crazy about this hat. The brim was a little too floppy, I returned it"
3.0,"Great boots, my feet were mostly toasty, easy to walk in, look great but in only slightly sub freezing weather, my toes were freezing. I was wearing mid weight Moreno socks both times, we were in Durango in deep slush,  boots are 100% waterproof and we walked around for a couple hours. I could buy thinsulate socks, but then the rest of my foot and ankle would roast."
3.0,"It looks cute in the pictures but it does not look as flattering on me. I am 5 feet 3.5 inches tall and weigh about 130 pounds. The top is slightly big on me. Especially the sleeves,  they are tad long. Also the bows come undone so many times a day it started to annoy me. May be OK for a taller women who is on a date and not so much for a petite women to wear it to work? May be."
3.0,"Nice color, I like the pocket, the material feels like a stiff soft cotton, squat proof if you don't mind the stiffness. No compression. I am 5'1 135lbs. I ordered a medium and it fit. They were packaged nicely, but just did not fit my needs."
3.0,The top of the dress was extremely small but the waist and hips were a perfect fit.  I ordered a medium and it was like having a small on top and medium on the bottom.<br />Loved the pattern and material bummed I had to return😞.
3.0,"I love the glasses but the magnets could be stronger, when around my neck they come disconnected often. I have an older pair similar and they never came apart unless you wanted them to."
3.0,Considering that I wore this ring everyday for 3 months I think it did ok. my toddler got a hold of my real wedding band so I bought this to wear as we wait to find the other. It doesn't look as good in real life as the picture. it's clearly not real. But for the price I got what I paid for.
3.0,These underwear run very small. They are super thin and aren’t hipster cut. The lace won’t holdup very long either. If you’re looking for something that will turn into a string and become a thong- these are perfect for you.
3.0,I am wearing the beige band. The piece of leather going around it to tuck the end of the band into is not smooth where the 2pieces are sewed together & the ends are not laying flat. It is irritating to the skin.
3.0,Very thin material and tight in the waist. For &quot;one size fits all&quot; I suppose you need that but I am a size 14 and it is quite tight.
3.0,I ordered a large and it fits a bit small.
3.0,This vest isn’t white. It is beige. I ordered a size up because I was afraid it would run small. I’m glad I did. Otherwise it’s cute.
3.0,I love this blouse however it seems small for a large.  I do like it enough to reorder it for an extra large.  (even though I have never worn an x-large
3.0,It was very Itchy
3.0,I wore this twice and there are holes under the left arm!  It also fits a little funny it feels like one arm is smaller than the other. Will not be purchasing again.
3.0,"Gets the job done, but the plastic gets sticky in a melty kind of way. Not made for the long term?"
3.0,I have used the coat for six days and some buttons have falling down.
3.0,I order this for Easter and one was broke very hard to close but the kids love the design
3.0,Really cute and blingy!!! Hard to clasp. I loved the concept but I sent mine back because of the clasp.
3.0,okay  it appeard to be silver
3.0,"This tee is really cute, but I got a size XL and when I put it on it felt like a size L. It was tight around the belly and upper chest. I wore it hoping that it would stretch a little before our girls party but it didn’t. It will now become a night shirt. If this came in a 2x I would have exchanged it."
3.0,I was really not pleased with this purchase. The material was a bit itchy and the fit was just awkward.
3.0,Hard to see that it's a cat when wearing.
3.0,a pretty watch...but the band keeps coming off. that getting old.
3.0,Very nice just took a long time to shipping it put
3.0,"I ware a large sometimes extra large. This felt like a med trying to put it on.. It is pretty and as shown, but I feel like its a not sized right on the chart."
3.0,I bought this jacket on the official site and there was no rewiew. So this is nice  fit jacket. But it is not for cold weather . It is very thin.  It is more like  usual fleeces. Too expensive for just fleece.
3.0,"Think you get what you pay for here, a little short and okay quality. Will be good for a one time use."
3.0,Doesn’t slide into watch correctly and WILL scratch the inside up. If you dont mind tugging a little it’s a nice band
3.0,I mean they are really pretty and stuff but like having to put a magnet in ur nose is uncomfortable 😣 plus it different even look real in all honesty
3.0,Didn't fit right. Too much indentation at shoulders.
3.0,"The bar is a good length.  One of the hearts fell out about a week after getting it. But for the price if two its not a big deal. They do rub the top of my mouth when I'm sleeping,  but besides that its very comfortable. Was delivered fast.  I would deffently buy again."
3.0,Costume party
3.0,"I am returning this dress, but it is very nice and fits well. I wear a size 12/14 and bought the XL. I could probably fit nicely in the L. I'm returning it because I feel like it makes me look older. I'm 42 and don't want to look 42. :-) Maybe if it were sleeveless I would have kept it."
3.0,I got this.They are light and see thru.I wear as lounge pants.Loose enough for exercise pants.Ties on side.
3.0,"Since the straps are attached under the foot area, after a little while, it will irritate that area and could cause a blister. great for little bits of walking but definitely not for walking more than a few min at a time."
3.0,Hard strip. Hard to keep it on. Look good though.
3.0,I love the bracelets and I got them for me and my husband but they are like coming apart almost like they were not made properly or something like that. I love the packaging though .
3.0,Scratchy pokey are the words to describe how it feels to wear.  Also if you order this don't expect it to be shipped on time!
3.0,I like them but the color don’t stay long
3.0,There are better designs offered from Rawlings.  They function as described.  I had many of my players borrow these glasses from me when we faced sun glare in our games.  These glasses have too much plastic in the center around the bridge of the nose.  This is not as comfortable as other models.
3.0,They fit some of my fingers but not the smaller ones. They are all one size so I decided just to stack them. They work for me.
3.0,"Have had them about six months and they are starting to fall apart, used once a week for 1 hour"
3.0,"The material and lining seem flimsy, and the strap arrived with the stitching coming off already, but it's the biggest bag I could find on Amazon, although I wish it was a bit bigger. I can't smell, so I have no idea if it smells or not like all the other reviews. The front of it is cute, but the other side of it looks like someone tried to paint it to look like leather."
3.0,"This just wasn't flattering. It sort of fit me in that the sleeves were long enough but only because the underarms were loose and not fitted to me. The neckline didn't lay right, sort of puckering. The product page says it's polyester & spandex but it *seemed* like a poly cotton mix which concerned me because I was afraid it would shrink in the wash and not cover my butt sufficiently, since it only just did as is. I am posting an unflattering photo just to help other people! I sent it back."
3.0,My loop thing already fell off haven’t even had a chance to put keys on it yet 🤦🏼‍♀️
3.0,Gets the job done when it comes to cuts
3.0,Great price but one pair broke in a week with very little use
3.0,"Luigi’s hat came with an “M” ... should have been an “L” ... you know, for Luigi. Otherwise the costume is ok for the price."
3.0,"Was expecting more of a vintage light pink, but it is baby pink. Good fit overall. But could be a little longer. Nice soft material, kind of stretchy. Haven’t washed yet, so not sure how it will hold up."
3.0,Nothing special. OK shorts.
3.0,Fit right slightly awkward cut but overall not a bad suit.
3.0,This item is really small! My son is typically a 2t and this 3/4 just fits him. The look is quite cute but definitely cheaply made.
3.0,This dress fit fine and the links was good but I was expecting navy blue and coral and it was navy blue and bright orange. The biggest concern for me was that the Fabric at the top of the dress is completely see-through.  If you’re OK with wearing a top underneath I think this would be alright.
3.0,Does not flatter your figure and the knit wholes are smaller than on the picture.  The quality is great for that I’d try a different style.
3.0,The decal is just soso
3.0,It ok thin made.
3.0,"Too small for me- But pretty well made. I gave it to my sister who is a little bit smaller than me, and it fits her well and she likes it."
3.0,"The material this dress was made out of was very nice, soft and stretchy. I just did not like the style on me. It made my hips look to big. I'm returning it today. I'm 5'3&#34; and 132 lbs. I ordered a size small"
3.0,I gave 3 stars because i like the exterior structure but i hate the interior structure of the purse. The interior feels like a paper bag.
3.0,"Nice bracelet but they fit too large in size for my 17 and 10 year olds hands, they thought."
3.0,I ended up getting a gift as this in one so I  returned it otherwise it works perfectly fine
3.0,"Soft material and very high quality, however, I ordered 0-3 months and I will be lucky if it fits her at 12 months."
3.0,"so, i knew what was buying..it more about the look than anything else.. great size, very manly.and its not really diamond cut.<br />Diamond cuts are shiny..over all a great chain..great size for a man..light weight but you still can feel in on..i sleep with mines and no issues ,yet"
3.0,The white lining peaks out from underneath because they are not sewn together at the bottom. I don’t want to have to worry about always adjusting it to make sure the lining doesn’t show so I am returning it.
3.0,Too small on the calves
3.0,"it's really a very nice quality swimsuit. i got a large in red for my sister but the cups were too small for her chest size and now the only size i can get in red is small? what happened? all sizes had a red option im february when i ordered this, it's been less than a week and now the only size in red is small?"
3.0,They are tiny! I wish sellers would list inches as well metrics.
3.0,"Just a fine hat, no more. Not sure that this is really leather."
3.0,"The color is lighter than it appears on the photo and in person the material looks cheap, like a table cloth design but it’s alright-ish"
3.0,Fit very well and love the print. Had to do 3 Stars because one of the pockets was only stitched on one side.  Very disappointing.
3.0,"This tiara looks very pretty in your hands, the golden fabric and details are pretty, but the shape of it doesn't fit a childs head very well. It didn't work for my 4 years old daughter so far."
3.0,Love the color. The Medium fits well on me. Great for a night out. Will buy more colors.
3.0,The dress fit pretty good I just don't really like the way it looks on me.  I feel like I'm wearing a shower curtain.
3.0,I like the necklace but it fell apart and I have to have it fixed in order to wear it. I wore it once before it fell apart
3.0,"These broke within 2 weeks of receiving them.  I am a fan of Locs overall, but I think this maybe is a bit of a faulty design.  I am a little disappointed to say the least."
3.0,"Not my favorite shirt, even though I have had a lot of success on Amazon, generally.  It fits a little oddly and is not as flattering as the photo.  I will still wear it, but won't be buying another one."
3.0,"The fit is great, but it's completely see through."
3.0,"Fit fairly well, just seem to be an average or lower shoe.  Was the first ones I'd ever purchased, so wasn't sure I was going to like them.  They grips tend to not line up well with the spin cycle pedals that we use, but are definitely an improvement over wearing a regular sneaker."
3.0,Just what I was looking for but it broke after a few uses.  I'm hopeful someone will be able to fix it.
3.0,It was adorable and from the front was perfect but the bedside the material was thinking and I was a little uncomfortable so I returned it. Size was as described etc.
3.0,Smaller size then expected.
3.0,"This was much thinner than I like, but is pretty."
3.0,"These took a month and a half to arrive, and they did after Christmas which is a disappointment so they couldn’t be from “Santa”. When they finally got here I was happy with the product they were for my kids as they got watches for Christmas. The sizes were correct and fit good. Good Apple knock offs. Only a lower rating due to taking forever to ship."
3.0,"The cheap plastic face on the watch scratches very easy. Its hard to size the band and i even bought a tool to do it with.over all, a little more quality could have been put into the watch and made it better.<br />update'  when I contacted the watch supplier they pointed out that I did not remove the plastic on the face. once I did that I could see that there was no scratches anymore.<br />It's all good now"
3.0,Loved the color snd material.  Seemed to run small. Tight in waist.
3.0,"Sizes seem rather odd, and the material is... flimsy. I don't know what my expectations were, so I don't know why I should feel disappointed. I think one is better off buying a set of multi-colored bags so the contents are obvious without unpacking. These work best when stuffed to attain some shape. The larger bags are good for carefully folded and layered dress shirts—but again, they should be packed in as tightly as possible to avoid squirming and wrinkles."
3.0,"They are pretty, not heavy, and look high quality."
3.0,I love the skirt but the sizing is all wrong. I ordered xl but it’s a small according to the size and fit of my other skirts when compared.
3.0,"Kind of flimsy feeling material. However, it serves the purpose of a light-weight cover for summer wear."
3.0,"These housecoats were cut very small for a 3X fits like a Large, disappointed."
3.0,After you wash it one time the fabric looks like it’s been worn for years. I’m going to try a fabric shaver to see if it helps.
3.0,Purchased this item. It’s not bad but I thought the pants would be more sturdy around the tummy.  They almost didn’t fit my legs. I had a stretch and pull the pants until my legs fits in them comfortably
3.0,Very constricting at top despite ordering according to my dimensions.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in the workmanship. very cheaply made. No cutting lines to go by to shorten. I am only going to wear these occasionally so they will work, but dont think they would stand up to daily wear."
3.0,They made your skin turn green
3.0,"The neon green was yellow, I bought these to match my daughters softball uniform and couldn’t use them"
3.0,fabric is clingy I love the sweater but I used Downy and a static cling spray and it still stuck to me. I'm keeping it because it is a cool sweater
3.0,"I have a 22 inch circumference had and this was too big for me. Probably better for someone whose head is 23-24 inches in circumference.<br />This hat has a nice feel to it. I like the material, but it's a tad heavy,  and the chin toggle is great.<br />The toggle strap is removable and I found that the clips to remove the strap (located near the brim) caught and pulled my hair.<br />The brim is really nice and wide at 4 1/2 inches. The brim sticks straight out in some places and not in others so you tend to get that wrinkled mushroom look.  The hat also has a bow sewn on the side but it's easy to cut this off without ruining the hat if you don't like it.<br />I much prefer the Jeff & Aimy Unisex Outdoor UPF 50+ Sun Hat Wide Brim Packable Fishing Hat with Neck Flap. It fit me better and is lighter."
3.0,Kind of cheap and see through. Wide and short. Cute fabric though.
3.0,"Cute skirt. Very much a denim skirt, very thick and bulky, has no give. Very tight on the waste and big in the hips (don't usually have this issue!). Overall cute and will work for the occasion I need it for but not something I'll wear regularly."
3.0,I have owned these for a few months and have washed them at least 20 times.  They hold up well in the dryer and don't shrink.  They are comfortable and do a good job at compression but the material is thicker and harder to get on than the vital sox brand.  I definitely like the vital sox better.  If you have pets watch out these are pet fur magnets.  Fur stuck all over them even after washing and using dryer sheets...weird.
3.0,"Inconsistent sync with phone, often required forced syncing. Today it just stopped working or charging.  Looked cool and worked okay, but suboptimal."
3.0,So soft and fleek but only issue was lint coming off and getting on other clothes
3.0,nice product but ring turns your finger green
3.0,"Great wig for Dr. Seuss day. My students got a kick out of it.  It was a little itchy though, I think that goes with the territory of wigs though."
3.0,"I wish that this product fit better and was more comfortable. I am saving it as I am trying to lose a little weight, but for now I can only wear it for short periods as lingerie."
3.0,These are ok.  But they stretch out.  I would size down.
3.0,Seemed a bit short for size 10...and somewhat snug with the straps; the toe strap bit into my foot...and had to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent blisters....otherwise the product was what I was expecting.
3.0,The material felt cheap
3.0,nice simple watch. I was hoping the face was much bigger
3.0,"These are very stiff and not very comfortable. I wanted to get them to hang the restroom key on for clients, but unless it will relax, might be sending them back. I'm sure as stiff as they are, they will hold up over time, but currently have a permanent bend in the middle from shipping."
3.0,This grab bag of anklets had my granddaughter in a spin! They're not strongly made; we had one come to pieces right away out of the bag.... but there were so many more to choose from! They're cute and lots of fun if you're not expecting a lifetime of wear.
3.0,"It looks nice at a glance but the edges are a little poorly made. Although it hasn’t yet, it feels like it might come undone."
3.0,"This was a very inexpensive watch, so one needs to keep that in mind. That being said, the digital display is fine, it is quite easy to adjust. My only complaint is that the built-in light is worthless: it barely illuminates a small portion of the extreme left-hand side of the watch, and does not light up the digital display at all, so if you want to see what time it is and it is dark--for example, if you wake up in the middle of the night--forget about it."
3.0,"Pretty hat, as my husband comments. It's light and sits firmly on my head. I like that about it.<br /><br />I hope it truly lives up to its claim to provide UPF 50+. I believe the polyester material itself may have that high UPF value. But doubt the make-up. As I walk under the under with this hat, I notice light coming in between the seam. The brim is a bit wrinkled, which might have lead to the light holes??? Hopefully that can be solved by having the fabric ironed..."
3.0,"I have used Thin Optics for years and really love them. However, my glasses broke recently and I ordered these.<br />They are way too tight across the bridge."
3.0,I didn't like it.  It feels cheaply made and it looks better on the picture than in person.
3.0,"I like how the top fits, however the fabric is really cheap."
3.0,"I love the pattern and colors, but honestly the fabric is a bit lacking. Very cheap. Also, I am a size L, and ordered an XL bit it was still skin-tight. Sadly returning."
3.0,This dress was one of my favorites that I ordered from the boho style. I wanted to keep it so badly- the problem with it is that the silky liner beneath it was a little off- so when I would try it on it pulls in an odd way across the chest. If you adjust straps it’s either so loose that it shows off the side of my bra OR it just pulls across and creates a line/ridge straight across my bust. Very weird- it’s a shame bc it was inexpensive and the material/pattern was super pretty. Going to return bc it just doesn’t work.
3.0,Fit is a bit snug. Super disappointed
3.0,A little tighter than I like and too short
3.0,This is a picture of the bracelet I ordered  However it is NOT the bracelet I received. The bracelet received has a Jewel and 2 hearts with the Sweet  16 charm.
3.0,They fit right but it’s poorly design big blue tag in the back that kills the look of the jeans can’t take it off it’s part of the pants  looks better on pictures but not in person
3.0,I’ve had better. Once u swear these are falling down
3.0,The writing on it is almost impossible to read.  I thought I had gotten the wrong charm.  I still cannot read it with cheater glasses on but my son could read it.  Otherwise a good charm.  Lorraine
3.0,"Cute style and pattern.  Arrived well before I expected it.  My birthday is on Halloween and I thought this would be cute handing out candy in and going out! The dress itself fits really odd.  I'm 5'4"" 122-125 depending on day.  The dress is pretty long for my height but if I hem it, it will cut off the jack o lantern pattern at the bottom.  Maybe it could be adjusted from where the fabric is sewn on to the shirt.  The material at the waist has plenty of give and is even stretchy but I still feel like I can't breathe! It's just an odd fabric and feels scratchy.  For a one time wear it's so so I guess.  I probably won't wear it though lol"
3.0,I believe it's because of the kind of material it's made out of. It fits my daughter weirdly and there's nothing we can do with the top nor bottom.
3.0,Looks much cheaper than advertised.
3.0,The outfit is really cute! The top fits perfectly. But the pants are a NO! They are made for people with heavy bottoms. Like it’s too much material. I was hoping for it to be fitted. That’s the only reason I’m returning it.
3.0,"Quality seems alright, but the Light Brown is closer to a longhorn burnt orange. Do not get if you want to match with light brown boots."
3.0,SOFT MATERIAL
3.0,"I really wanted to love these, I have always had good experiences with VIV Collection. Sadly not a fan of these at all. I ordered 2 sizes up after reading reviews and they are still weird around my hips. They &#34;fit&#34; but the fabric is still close enough to me and thin enough material that I feel extremely self conscious wearing these as anything other than layers. I would have loved to be able to wear these under cardigans with leggings but that is not happening. I fear a size up would still not really be loose enough for my comfort, and the straps would be much too long for the rest of my body."
3.0,"Order a size smaller for sure, the glossy finish makes it too ily and slippery, I would have preferred a bit of a flat finish and texture which gave it some grip"
3.0,Double layer let’s you use it as a face mask alternative. Too heavy for summer.  Cooling factor is a hoax.
3.0,"They're cute, but they scratched easily."
3.0,Material is nice and soft. It runs a bit small and fits nothing like the picture.
3.0,It was longer than i expected ... to tie from the top but the style is nice and material doesnt look cheap at all !!!!
3.0,It isn't the greatest design but it works fine and fits fine. Graphics are not the best in the world.
3.0,"Considerably smaller than it appears in all the pictures.... I wanted a larger one, so I will keep this one for a gift.."
3.0,"These are incredible light weight. They almost seem like they should float in water because they are so light. I thought the bottom was made of really thick rubber from the picture but its not. On the flip side, they fit my kids really well and they seem to like them. I'm not sure how well they would do long term in the snow but for short distances to school they seem to be okay. I also purchased this boot in a different color for my son and the buckle on the front already snapped off."
3.0,it was smaller than I expected and its a little flimsy but its cute
3.0,"These tops are fairly thin and not very ‘compressive’ and also run a bit larger than I expected. I returned a size small for a size extra small, so plan to do the same if you want a snug fit, as I do. I need the compression, following a medical procedure, so was looking for it."
3.0,"The product is as advertised, but the replacement pins are a little too short."
3.0,"Camoflauge blue may sound like a cool color, but when these socks arrived I immediately tried washing them because they looked like they were oil stained.  Of course it didn’t wash out in the laundry, that is apparently what they are supposed to look like.  The quality and feel seem fine (like virtually all other socks).  The fit is fine.  They feel substantial so they may turn out to have an excellent life span."
3.0,the wood is not as red as the pic i do understand that the pic is not the exact product but not even close to the red i was expecting
3.0,Runs small but good quality!
3.0,I ordered 2 pair of these 1 for me and 1 for my daughter my daughters broke after about 2 weeks
3.0,Cute style. Ran small and heavier than I wanted.
3.0,"The zipper barely works, it gets stuck almost every time I try to zip or unzip."
3.0,Runs small. See through.
3.0,"Runs a little small. Usually a size 32 and ordered a size up, but still short in length. Definitely recommend going a second size up."
3.0,Decent for the money but runs small. I will return it.
3.0,"very pretty top, NO give in bust area, choked the arms ... had to return it was just way too tight, if you are top heavy there is NO give I even ordered up"
3.0,The shirt itself is very pretty!! which is why I give it three stars but if you are bigger chested I don't think this would be their shirt for you the shirt fit me everywhere else but my boobs. I'm a D cup and the shirt did not fit well in the chest area.
3.0,Cute but it's design causes it to always roll so that the words are facing my wrist and all that ever shows is the hearts around the outside
3.0,"Cute, but definitely not real Amber of any kind. Stylish still."
3.0,It fits ok but material although cute looking it is stiff even after washing
3.0,The mask was a gift for my grandson. He loved it and it fit him perfect. The only thing is the mouth moves which is great but the teeth and chin part that moves the mouth was not glued on right. I had to get glue and put it back together. Other than that he loves this mask
3.0,Product is as shown & described.  I do have 1 issue....IT IS NOT ADJUSTABLE!!<br />Easley falls off my head.🙁
3.0,"The color is neon pink, not what we wanted but kept anyway."
3.0,"The wallet is fairly well made at first glance, has a divider in the main pocket, and the symbol of the fairy tail guild is nicely molded onto the surface. I am satisfied with this product as a fan of fairy tail, but as a guy who also wanted a functional wallet, I'm also somewhat disappointed.<br />For one, it's a tad bit big. I suppose this is to give the guild symbol the space it needed, and it fits in my pocket alright, so I'll let that point slide. My first major complaint comes with the clear pocket for your licence. For whatever reason it doesn't seem to be fitted correctly and I couldn't fit my license in it for the life of me. It was only on closer inspection that I found the glue seemed to have been plastered in a way so that the pocket was a bit too small for my license. I had to peel some of the glue away to make room, which makes me question the wallet's overall durability (and more importantly how quickly I'll be able to wrestle my license out of the pocket now that it's wedged in there). My second complain comes with the card pockets opposite to the license pocket. The bottom pocket is fine, but the top two are too deep. They need to be staggered and made a proper depth so that the card pokes out of the top and can be easily be fetched at a moment's notice. While the bottom pocket does that well, the middle and top pockets, as mentioned earlier, are so deep that if you put your card horizontal like you normally would, it'll just sink down into the pocket, making it difficult to tell which card is in which pocket.<br />All in all, I like the style; it's an excellent idea to mark your wallet with the symbol of your favorite guild, but the wallet needs to work as a wallet, otherwise you won't want to carry it around and show it off. If you're willing to live with the design oversights and want that feeling, this is the product for you. If you need a good, durable, functional wallet, look elsewhere."
3.0,"Great, comfortable..... only problem is the nose piece broke soon after i got it, luckily i know how to sew and replaced it"
3.0,To small have to return it
3.0,These fit well but the strength is all wrong.  I should have just ordered the zero strength because I've ended up having to wear these over my real glasses.  I haven't used them long but I do think they're helping with eye fatigue.
3.0,"The pocket was ripped when I receved it. Otherwise, it's a decent casual top."
3.0,A bit thinner than I like.
3.0,"Material is kinda itchy. Fit is okay, but the shirt runs small. I'm a 34D, ordered a large but it gaps across the bust"
3.0,"It's smaller than I had expected, especially the handle but it seems like it's well made and durable."
3.0,I wish the shorts was a little bit longer and made with spandex
3.0,"Fabric is really a downer, but you get what you pay for, at only $39 bucks I can't really complain.<br />I richer fabric would have set it off - do I recommend the purchase, yes. But not a dress that I will<br />regularly wear."
3.0,"I have a small head,  but this is tight!  It's still new,  and hasn't been washed yet,  so maybe it will loosen up."
3.0,This wallet is pretty good but shipping took lot of time. I wanted it for my cosplay and I ordered it more than 40days ago and it came today and cosplay show was week before.
3.0,The necklace looks awesome. But the amulet keeps falling off of the cord.
3.0,not as expected.. very thin and delicate. Still a good buy .
3.0,These are funny and not funny at the same time.  The material on these is ultra soft t-shirt style material. Feels fantastic on your skin.  But there is a reason why it is normally ONLY a t-shirt.  When you make it into pants something happens to it.<br /><br />It has the ability to keep growing..sorta.  These shorts look like your standard basketball or house-pant/PJ shorts.  But YOU can put them on and pull the waist band (or at least I can) to my under arms!  I am not kidding.  I look like I have the worlds WORST wedge !<br /><br />So yeah these aren't flattering at all.  Soft yes.  Can they give your partner a snort laugh you betcha.  Do I want to wear them around where anyone might see...Nope.
3.0,"The size states on size fits all, not true!<br />Although these are super cute and probably very comfortable, they are way to small. I am 5'7 size 16 and there is no way these will fit. I will give to me 13 year old niece as the will fit her perfectly."
3.0,"It's a cute shirt for 10$ I didn't expect much, ordered up a size based on reviews still very tight around chest [34C]  But loose everywhere else so it feels really weird to wear it."
3.0,It tangles a lot and discolored easily .
3.0,I dislike about mask after you wear it for a few days it start putting line threw mask. Need a better  Material
3.0,The bra fit normal but the cropped body was slightly baggy. Also would like shorter shoulder length to hold the girls up a little better.
3.0,"Such a pretty necklace!  A little smaller than I thought it would be. It's about the size of a nickel,  but it's still very nice and comes in a nice gift box with a bow! However there is No S925 stamp and I can just tell it's not sterling silver. That's why I give it only 3 stars. Almost all the jewelry on Amazon that says it's Silver is NOT. Amazon should clamp down on the liars like this."
3.0,Pants have odd cut
3.0,This arrived with the wand broken.  Can I get a replacement wand?
3.0,"Meh. I love the print and color of this shirt. It's printed on an American Apparel shirt. It's very soft. But it is sooooooo short! I have to wear a long tank top underneath because I'm too old to be letting my middle hang out all exposed like, and I refuse to do high waist anything! LOL"
3.0,These pants are pretty but the size runs small
3.0,they are a good face cover not to fond of the white and grey they get dirty quickly but wash out ok unless strained.
3.0,It’s for a birthday gift.. later in August.
3.0,The link an fastener look very cheap I love the beads but feel that part could have been a little nicer.
3.0,"bought for daughter for Halloween , this is made for someone at least 5'4 or taller .  We added a dress shirt, hat  and tie , it was great"
3.0,This item runs very small. Color was nice. Had to return
3.0,The headband is nicely made.  When I wear it  slides off the back of my head easily.  I have to use barrettes to secure it down better.  I think that if the elastic part was made a little bit longer than this problem wouldn't be an issue.
3.0,I expected the magnifying glass to be encased but it's not so it just dangles freely underneath the pendant.  Otherwise a very pretty piece.
3.0,Fit good and is soft although original apple band is more soft. There is a metal pinch clamp at the end of the band. The corner kept ever so slightly catching on fabrics. The original apple band has a plastic/silicone end piece so I never thought about this component being an issue but it bugged me enough after catching on a bend new couch pillow pulling a thread runner that I had to remove this band and put my worn out original apple band back on.
3.0,Cute print but it’s much lighter than the picture advertised. I don’t like how it crosses in the front right in the middle of my boob. Material is nice! For me this did not fit true to size... I got a 2x but it fit more like a L/XL...<br />Super quick shipping!!!
3.0,Nice top but fits tight in my arms. There's no stretching there. I had hoped to wear with leggings but not long enough. I'm 5'6&#34;.
3.0,"Overall this is a pretty decent swimsuit for the price. I found it runs very slightly larger than expected, but still fits alright. My main issue is that the sides on the bottom are different sizes by a tiny amount but definitely noticeable as it makes my hips look unbalanced.  The top is very nice overall and I'm going to pair it with a different bottom."
3.0,Loved it! Fit great
3.0,"This mask is a little small for a adult, it also has a silky feel too it so probably not a cotton mask, it does have ford on it in black with a blue line to the right."
3.0,"Nice work dress, need to wear nude or black  underwear or slip. Color  is different from the picture shown"
3.0,"I love these and I get compliments all the time, however they are not allergen-safe and my ears reacted poorly to wearing them. I haven't thrown them away because I still like to wear them for short periods of time, but any longer than an hour my ears are throbbing."
3.0,I'm very big busted and it was not flattering a popped out the sides it was a little too restricting and I order two sizes up.
3.0,Product did not hold up well. Elastic broke after only 3 wears.
3.0,Not for my body type.
3.0,"Size is too large, I hope you choose size attention."
3.0,"Its pretty, but the dial is hard to read"
3.0,"Comfortable fit, good quality fabric. Personally I typically like my tanks slightly tighter, as I would wear them under another garment. I did order a large, but probably could have gone with a medium. They also don't shrink much when washed. I'm a 34C bra size for scale."
3.0,Well I was looking for more of a lounge pants and this material was more dressy and I was frayed of pulling threads if I was working in my garden or something with them—They are nice if you’re looking for silky type pants but I wasn’t
3.0,"They run a bit large so maybe size down if you're between sizes. They have a band at the top of the waistband that you can definitely see that you may or may not like. You can feel the pattern from the inside as you wear them so you may hate it or not even notice. The pockets are decent. You definitely get what you pay for, they're not amazing but not horrible. They are squat proof so I'll probably still end up wearing them."
3.0,"I thought it would fit a 6 ft. person.....waist too small,pant length too short.  I will end up wearing it so it wont be a total lost."
3.0,"Just want everybody to know that there is a lot of length shrinkage but I'm tall. Other than that issue, they are nice and comfortable."
3.0,They really don't stay up so your mouth and noise doesn't stay covered
3.0,"I really like this jacket - both in terms of fit/comfort & look.<br /><br />The problem is that one of the buttons popped off after only a week of use. Not a good sign for its longevity as a jacket used on a consistent bases for the purposes of...a jacket. If you'd like it for a one-off event or a ""wear two/three times a year"" situation then I think it's good - but it's clearly not meant for consistent or longterm use given it's already starting to fall apart and will only fall apart even more with consistent use."
3.0,"Cute bracelets however, I had to replace the inside string on the black one for my son as it was starting to fray."
3.0,The head band was not included. The size is a bit smaller than expected!! :(
3.0,"It's a cool tank, but not really &#34;all over&#34; as stated in product name."
3.0,"The top is nice, however it is not a blazer its more like a cardigan...."
3.0,Pretty boot but it digs in on the ankle. These boots do stretch out and may work after a day or so but I didn't wait to see. Also I ordered the brown with white fur and it came with Brown on Brown. Sadly returned and bought another style.
3.0,Came apart within a couple of weeks of wear. Will need to repair
3.0,The watch band is too large and can’t be adjusted.
3.0,3 because small is like large size. Too baggy
3.0,OK is about all I can say ~ the dryer didn't do it any good!  At least they fit tightly which was my intention but I need to lose 15 pounds . . .
3.0,"My fianc&eacute;e and I picked this ring out about 6 months ago.  We aren't married yet but I wear it anyway.  I really liked this ring when I first received it, but over time it has faded a lot.  I work on cars and I do not wear this ring when I'm getting my hands dirty- I always take care not to damage it or put it through too much wear and tear.  Unfortunately in this short span of time it looks thoroughly worn and aged.  The Inside ""brushed"" part of the ring is now a faded grey color compared to the matte black it was when it was new.<br /><br />That said, the ring still looks cool.  I decided to go ahead and order another ring for going out.  This one is now a back-up ring and I got a high polish style for special occasionst. For the price you can't beat it- but be aware this ring will not look the same as it did when it was new, even just a few months after you order it."
3.0,Cheaply made. Can see where they might come apart. It's functional
3.0,"I think that these boots are made of good quality. However, I did not like the style.  Returned to seller."
3.0,"These work very well if you want to hide a piercing (I used mine for my vertical labret). However, they are a little bit on the longer side which isn't too much of a problem but it does make it slightly more noticeable for people up close to you. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it caused an allergic reaction which in turn made me have to remove the piercing. So I would not suggest this if you have sensitive skin or you know of any allergies you may have of plastics."
3.0,"I like the fact that it’s convertible.  You have a detachable crossbody shoulder strap, handles, or the convenience of a backpack.  The fabric is a little lighter weight than expected. What I was not expecting was the bright yellow interior.  I would have preferred a different interior color.  As far as durability and water resistance, I have only had for a little over a week."
3.0,"Good shirt. Basic material, I wish it was softer."
3.0,width is too narrow. woild be nice if the width be  a few inches wide to complement the length.
3.0,I expected it to be tight.
3.0,"Lightweight being a key word. I would just cut to the chase and call them thin. Also not a typical &#34;men's&#34; size, my hands are pretty average for a male but even trying to let them stretch they were very small."
3.0,It doesn't like the wind much but if we just let it hang and float in the breeze it's okay. We are going to try and tie it down to our deck railing like a camper canopy. I am from Kansas but moved to Colorado and now live on a mountain. It would NEVER survive in Kansas but up here the trees block most of the wind so its not too bad. We put it in a spare wheel from out pickup with two sandbags and it's not going anywhere. If you don't want to weigh it down with something don't buy it. It will fall over in the smallest of breezes. Now for the umbrella. It's huge! It's waterproof and it is made with a very thick material that seems like it should last a long time. Very nice on our deck and  covers the fire pit and four chairs.
3.0,My grandson loved them but there were no directions on how to operate them so that was disappointing.
3.0,No one will mistake this for high end jewelry.  It is flashy & fun.  &#34;Crystal&#34; is a stretch in terminology.  It's just glass. The earrings look cheesier than the necklace.  I wanted the red & yellow in this multi colored set - but I'll bet the silver toned one is classier looking.
3.0,Yes a lot cheaper than the qalo ring but you can definitely tell the difference. Fit tight and doesn't breath.
3.0,"I don't usually wear large earrings so as expected these were very heavy for me, too heavy to wear all night. They make a nice statement but the weight takes away stars. If wearing heavy earrings doesn't bother you, they may work but I've enjoyed bigger but lighter earrings in the past."
3.0,"The material is a thick and good fit, but the waist is slightly tight."
3.0,"petty, but the turquoise fell out as soon as I opened package, I had to super glue it back in."
3.0,Husband loves it!!!
3.0,"Scratch easy and had some minor issues with one Lense figment (too loose so it pops our easily) overall, decent for the price when compared to the real replacement lenses from Oakley"
3.0,"These glasses are very nice but not for me. I received them today and they sent the wrong mirrored lense color which was a disappointment. Besides that, I tried them on and realized that this did not fit my face at all. I have a pretty small round face and They pretty much ate my face up. (They also came with a tiny s arch on the inside of the lense). Sadly, I will be returning mine. But I love the style and wished they made them a bit smaller. If you have a medium face size, I absolutely recommend.<br /><br />A few days later this company contacted me and I received​ a full refund!"
3.0,"Way too large. It would be large even if there were two of me wearing it at the same time. I wear a size 18/20 and ordered a XXL. It is cotton and polyester so it won’t shrink when washed. Length was good, and well made but for its ridiculous width the belt was too short. I could tie the belt, but just. No inside ties to hold it in place."
3.0,Purchased in April 2014.  Worked well and still does other that it has become loud with a ticking noise.  May be on it's last leg.
3.0,Seemed like it was costume jewelry but she liked it and hope she wears it. It didn't really look like it was what it said
3.0,Not stunning
3.0,"Stitching isn't super strong; it came loose from the trim on the top of the shoulder. Otherwise, this is a really cute jumpsuit, I get a lot of compliments."
3.0,"I'm usually a size 4-6 so I bought a medium and it was huge on me, this dress didn't give me any shape, looked like I was wearing a bag."
3.0,DEMASIADA PEQUEÑA
3.0,"Super cute but the shirt is a crop top, I want to be comfortable at home not put on a sexy fashion show"
3.0,This dress looked great. My only complain is that it is not white. It is off white but it fit great and worked out fine
3.0,super super thin but nice to wear on a hot summer day
3.0,"These leggings are a really cute idea, but unfortunately they are a little see through which is not the best. The material is soft, but thin. A fun idea for Halloween."
3.0,"While this top is adorable, it did not work for me as someone who is rather busty (36C). I would wear it, only if I did not button it up, which kinda defeats the point."
3.0,"Make sure you know what size your belt is as I believe this is for a 2&#34; belt.  I ordered this and found out my belt is 2 1/4 &#34; wide, so I had to modify the male side of the buckle and use my original female side to make a complete set."
3.0,"Of the three one was bent on the plane. What happened to it, who knows but the other two were fine. The bent on was ruined and I threw it away."
3.0,We bought these for our normal size 15yo. They don’t fit at all. They would fit probably a 10-12yo girl.<br /><br />We’re just saving them for our younger daughter or son some day.<br /><br />They are super cute. Just bad sizing.
3.0,"The size chart is misleading. This cover up is beautiful, but it is definitely too small to wear and feel comfortable in. Even if you were naked, it would still be tight. Bathing suit cover ups aren't supposed to be skin tight."
3.0,"I'm 5&#34;4 and 140 pounds ( heavier on the bottom) I was scared from the reviews that it wouldn't fit my booty so I ordered an 8 (XL) I would have been just fine with the 6 (L), I can still wear it comfortably though.  I did notice that it's a bit sheer so I'd recommand wearing black spandex or a slip underneath. It looks very cute on!"
3.0,"Very thin which is nice but very sharp edges.  Had to polish the inside  edge as it was slightly painful to wear at first. For the price, good ring."
3.0,"This is a t-shirt, not a sweater"
3.0,I am 5'2&#34; 135 36-24-36<br /><br />I am mostly lean muscle. I am not hippy but I do have a bubble butt and thick legs. I ordered a small and it fits very tight. I should have ordered the medium but the quality is not bad. Overall I really love the suit.
3.0,I like the way it looks. The band sucks a little bit. But it looks and runs good for the money
3.0,I loved this item when I saw. It did not have a size chart but I'm usually a medium or large so went with the large. It's a boutique large and fits smaller than most stores. It's a shame because I would have loved to keep it and wear it on my upcoming trip.
3.0,The fit is perfect! And the fabric is light and super comfortable. The only negative is the fabric turns dark blue when it absorbs sweat. That’s a bummer!
3.0,I was a bit disappointed in the appearance of the mask when I received it. The coloring looked much better in the picture. It was almost as if it was faded. Otherwise the mask is nice.
3.0,"I like the one ring, the round with no fancy bits on it. It's plain, it feels quality enough, very nice.<br />Adjusting the adjustable one kind of made the paint on it chip. It still adjusts, but it feels weak.<br />The largest one doesn't fit any of my fingers. I ended up forcibly breaking it in half and using it as two rings and I like it better that way."
3.0,very heavy and too small and narrow.
3.0,Not the highest quality and way more purple color than the picture.
3.0,Fabric is rather rough
3.0,"While the waist trainer definitely keeps everything in I don't think I could wear it when I go out. Unfortunately the zipper bulges,  making it obvious that I'm wearing it,  and it sinks into my waist as if it isn't hugging my belly tight enough..not sure what the issue is there.  I'm just very disappointed that I can't wear it out because I was planning on wearing it for a date.  Plans ruined."
3.0,"See through , very nice color tho ! I just wish you couldn’t see my booty cheeks"
3.0,They were nice but thought they would be better.  Very thin... haven’t washed them yet so we’ll see if they hold up.  Next time I’ll buy the cheaper ones
3.0,Very cute. Runs a bit big
3.0,I use this as a swim bag for myself and baby. It's smaller than a standard beach bag but fits our needs perfectly. It's even prettier in person and I absolutely love it. The only change that would make it better would be deeper pockets (my stuff falls out of them) but I just use smaller bags inside to organize.<br /><br />Edit: I just reviewed this last night and unfortunately have to come back and change 5 stars to 3. Its coming apart around the zipper as of this morning. I'm sad about that because I really do love the look of it.
3.0,"This jumpsuit is just ok. It's a bit short for my 5'11 frame and comes to the ankles. The cutouts are also a bit high on the side, sometimes showing a bit of sideboob, but it's pretty comfy all in all. The material has a nice stretch to it, and the seams are well sewn. It also has room for my large ass, and stretches nicely."
3.0,"I supported the vegan make up of the bag,I like the color, size but zippers can be opened up without the zipper. Maybe it's just my bag but I will try to replace it."
3.0,It was listed as a Maxi dress but only came to upper calf. Too short on 5ft 9 in person.
3.0,This bag is made really good but I'm giving it to my 9 year old granddaughter because it's too small. My checkbook won't even fit in it.
3.0,nothing said this was a pleated facemask. I bought it for that reason. But it came pleated. Buyer beware. But its cute!
3.0,"It's suuuper thin, almost see-through."
3.0,3rd time wearing these I put my thumb right through just below the top band pulling them on. I’m bummed because these were comfortable and made my legs feel good with no swelling.
3.0,"These were slightly smaller than expected, pretty good length (I’m tall 6’0”), the lace on the top and bottom tore easily, and theyre somewhat shear. Not too bad for the price but if those things are a priority for you you may need to keep looking."
3.0,I would like a little more flared skirt is all.
3.0,"I thought the hat in the photo was cute and looked exactly like what I was looking fir but upon receipt, the band of the hat was tight fitting and not slouchy at all. I never used it and returned it."
3.0,THEY ARE VERY SMALL
3.0,"Super cute, comfortable, and flattering. Wore it the first time and loved it. Washed it and the sewing along the top of the chest started detaching and created a hole. Very disappointing as it was going to be one of my new have summer pieces."
3.0,"Nice dress,,, the material is not as strong as I prefer. It is like a thick t-shirt material; I prefer the tight spandex type."
3.0,"The boots were exquisite!  But they ran very large; at least that was my experience. I ordered a size 8.5 to make enough room for an arch support. The boots were huge!  I think a size 7 or even a 6.5 might have fit, but I did not want to go back and forth with the shipping so I simply returned them. Next time I am in a tore that sells Tony Lama's, I will make a point of trying them on.  Other than that, a beautiful product."
3.0,it works. but it is also relatively small.  Good for a bakup watch in case you ran out of spare batteries for your watch.....
3.0,Got this strap for my raybans to wear when on the lake. They were advertised that it’ll float but after trying it out they do not float the glasses. Nice strap though will continue wearing till I find a floating replacement.
3.0,"The sizing on this dress may run small. I am 5'3 160 lbs, I normally wear a large in everything (shirts, dresses, etc.), but this dress was too small. I would order 1-2 sizes up, especially if you're heavy chested. Other than that, the dress was beautiful, the material was nice and light, and very well crafted."
3.0,Cheap feeling and too<br />Small
3.0,Love this necklace but the metal discolored pretty quickly.
3.0,"Algo que no me gusto es los bolsillos de atrás, al poner tu rompe vientos se cuelga demasiado la tela se estira y no es muy cómodo pedalear"
3.0,works on your tummy area more that the shoulder area I was interested in.
3.0,"It looks cute and flattering, but because of the way it's sewn the middle part that buttons down slants to the right. It's a little annoying to have to constantly adjust. Sleeves are also a little ill-fitting. Nice color and material though."
3.0,The fabric isn’t as nice as I expected but keeping and will use for golf
3.0,"They fit well and we’re comfortable. However, they’re see through and veryyyy high waisted. I got them for a music festival and I could pull them up past my boobs and it sorta ruined my outfit for that day :( Cute design tho. The material is too thin and offered no support like most biker shorts do."
3.0,The color is as pictured but the crown was poorly made. Arrived broken.
3.0,I love them but I only got three in my order.
3.0,Its not bad for the price. It doesn't have the best fit and you kinda have to play around with it in order to get the cinched waist figure that most corsets produce. Overall it's ok. I really don't know that I'll be ordering more of this particular brand and style.
3.0,The shoes are cute but I'm having to return two different pairs because they run so big.
3.0,"They feel fantastic when they are in the right place.  I have long legs and bigger calves and after even a minimal amount of walking around they slip down and start to collect at my ankles, which after enough collection becomes very uncomfortable.  If they made these in tall or wide calf sizes I would give them 5 stars in a second."
3.0,You get what you pay for. More of a novelty item than for serious wear.
3.0,"they came in an unpleasant looking brown box so I was kinda worried. but I was surprised. I'm 5 foot and I ordered an 8, they fit kinda snug but it'll do. they had a weird smell at first and the had dirt on them. because of the way they were folded in the box, it is kind of shaped weird. Fur on the inside falls out pretty easy. But overall not a bad product."
3.0,"Very pretty watch. Works just fine. The problem is, it’s hard to get on and off by yourself. I got it from my mom who is 85 years old and she can’t work the clasp."
3.0,It broke real easy.and I was gentle.
3.0,this is a gorgeous necklace but i wasn't expecting it to be so tight around my neck. it's a bit of a chocker .
3.0,"Super cute and looks exactly like it shows here, seems to be higher quality. I am normally a 1X and I got the biggest size and it was too small."
3.0,i love these earring but literally so heavy --- cant wear for long periods of time
3.0,The size I ordered was a med I returned them to big I reordered a small and they are still loose fitting i am a 5ft 6inch 140 lb. Woman I will not be ordering again they are just not tight enough do to the lack of spandex and to much polyester it's a shame because the quality feels like it is there
3.0,Comfortable and true to size. The color ran and 2 washes in it's pilling.
3.0,"We got them for our macaw to handle him easier when we take him outside. The moment we opened the packaging, it was a sucker punch to the nose! It smelt so bad we had to keep them outside for several days before getting close. Beware!"
3.0,"These fit as expected, but I wanted the colors to choose.  I bought 3 sets (at 2 different times) and only got the color black and grey.  No green or red.  Disappointed."
3.0,It's nice looking but a bit tight about my middle. I am a size 8/10 for reference.
3.0,"They’re just okay for me. Very large and not really wearable in cartilage for me. The metal is a bit flimsy and they don’t close easy. If you are looking for small dainty hearts for cartilage like I am, this isn’t it."
3.0,"For the price and brand name, I expected better quality. I took a risk buying an expensive pair of shoes for a growing teenager, but my son really loved them. Unfortunately, within 1 month the plastic in the heel stand on the back of the shoe got bent and was digging in to the back of my son's foot. We were able to fix the plastic with some muscle and determination, but six months later there are some sharp shards in that same area on both shoes that are stabbing my son. We haven't even owned these shoes for a year.<br />With the rigidity of the material used on the exterior of the heel, they could have used rubber or a more malleable support for the interior of the heel stand. The hard plastic that is in there feels like glass when it is cracked or bent. Poor design and quality since any stress to that portion of the shoe causes damage that make these unwearable.<br />Good looking shoes that are comfortable when they are not broken, but I wouldn't spend the money on this brand again."
3.0,"I purchased & wore these for a wedding and they made it through the church service and about 1 hour into dinner before I decided to just remove them. They stayed on and fit me, but for someone who is smaller chested they weighed more than my breasts do and that made them uncomfortable. I would recommend these for someone who needs more support, but for someone who solely needs nipple coverage I would recommend a product smaller in size and weight."
3.0,"While touted as being a LuLaRoe imitation, they absolutely are not.  They lack the wide yoga waistband and they are significantly thinner than LuLaRoe leggings.  As basic black leggings, they are fine.  They do have the brushed material like LuLaRoe so they feel good on."
3.0,Very mediocre and cheap looking.  Not horrible for the price.  But not anything I would wear or gift.  There was nothing wrong with it and it looks like the pics.
3.0,"The material is a little weird and is borderline cheap feeling, also fits a little large but otherwise very cute!"
3.0,"Made for little guys, order the next size up!"
3.0,"Necklace seems ok for the price we bought it, but no inspirational message card came with it which was really disappointing, ""GOOD FRIENDS ARE LIKE STARS. YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE THEM, BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE! I'M SO THANKFUL TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE!"""
3.0,Soft and comfortable but unlike other masks this presses against my eyes... I think curvature of the eye mask is not enough to make comfortable.  I reviewed this product after receiving a discounted price on it.
3.0,I ordered an extra small. I am 5’3 and 110 lbs. this item was just swimming on me and looked ridiculous. I know it is an apron and some extra looseness is expected but this was really absurdly sized for an extra small. I returned the item. Otherwise it is well made although fairly thin material.
3.0,The shoes are ok but the size es too large.
3.0,"I like the longer line of this bra, and it's well made, but the shape is just weird. I never wear it because I just feel like I look funny. You end up with sort of pointy boobs, but not your standard sort of 50's  look, it's just bizarre."
3.0,"These diving 'socks' are NOT a boot.  There is no zipper as stated in the description; they are pull-on wet suit material that is basically shaped into a sock.  For the price, and the fact they actually fit my size 10 very wide foot, I will keep likely them.  But as a diver, I would never wear these on a boat - the sole has minimal anti-slide texture.  They would be an accident waiting to happen on a rocking and rolling boat with a wet deck.  They may be satisfactory for snorkeling from a beach in warm water, or maybe walking in the surf along a beach to give a tiny bit of foot protection.  When scuba diving, I usually wear a bootie that has a neoprene thickness of 5mm.  Anything less results in cold feet!"
3.0,Material is not great but its a cute shirt.
3.0,"These are supposed to fit XXL ( 10/11 ? size but the are more fitted to a size 9.  They do stretch, but who wants to wear panties that are too tight? So these are just ok, but I'll never purchase them again. Also they continuously slide down"
3.0,Not true to my size. Should have ordered larger size.
3.0,I actually thought it was longer than it was
3.0,"This is not a dress, at least not in the 6 yr old size. She has to wear legging under it or you can see her bum. Not what I was hoping for but keeping it cuz she likes the color and fit."
3.0,"Beautiful flow, fabric, color, overall fit however the breasts are massive! I would need some major huge boobs for this to fit. I am going to get it altured and it should be perfect. Worth getting for price with alturations expected. I do love that it hides mom belly well and looks good with flats. I am 5 foot between 115-120 lbs 32B bra size."
3.0,"I was waiting patiently to enjoy this skirt. However it runs small I normally wear medium, but decided to buy this in a large and it was still snug on my hips. If you have hips and butt this is not the skirt for you"
3.0,Socks varied in size. Some were too small for my wife while other fit just fine.
3.0,Super cute & great material but the top ball is loose and easily snags onto underwear & other clothing
3.0,"they really run very small, a 9 toddler is like a 6, i did not change for other size because i did not what to take any more chance with the size even though i like the style of the shoes."
3.0,"Could be worse, but almost looks like it came out of a vending machine."
3.0,"Material is very thin, shapewear or a slip is needed. Dress is ok. I also bought the blue one. But these r not my favorite dresses."
3.0,"These were way smaller than I thought they were going to be, but they are nice. Fits well in the ear."
3.0,"cheaply made..no shape to the material,  very thin and see through."
3.0,"Material is stretchy, order a size larger if you don't want it too fit too snug. Material is super soft and hugs every curve of your body. Also this is a shear material. The quality could be better, but its definitely good compared to cheap materials."
3.0,"I'm 115lbs. 36c in chest. 5""2. Ordered a small but it was super big still.  I had to cut to make adjustments."
3.0,"I was really happy when I first opened the package because it looked beautiful! But when I took the watch off the pillow it came on, one of the leather bracelet bands slipped off the hinge and fell off! I can't wear it anymore and I can't find any way to reattach the band to the watch face without it slipping off every few minutes. Now I just have a watch face with a band only connected on one side!"
3.0,"My bestie got this same sweater for Christmas and I admired it (she loves it).<br /><br />I ordered the yellow and the color is great. The fabric and big pockets are surprisingly nice. The sleeves are snug on the forearm and then sort of turn bat wing at the upper arm. My issue is the boxy fit of the bodice part. There's no shape to it and I felt it made me look big. I considered sewing a strip of elastic at the small of the waist for a cinched look, but in the end decided the fit is not for me and returned it. My rating is based on fit, but for the price it's a good value.<br /><br />For reference I'm 5'4"" 145 lbs, hourglass shape. My regular size is 8 or medium. Medium was the size I ordered and is true to size."
3.0,It’s a cute design but honestly way pinker than the pictures. I was expecting like a subtle rose gold shade but what I received was a bit too much.
3.0,"These were soft and comfortable. However,  they dont want to stay up on the face very well. Stretches out easily."
3.0,"These socks slide off my feet. I have to keep adjusting them.  When I step, they slide. I bought them to wear with my Tieks. I don't like wearing shoes without socks. It looks like the search continues.  These just didn't do it for me."
3.0,"Very cute shirt, but it fits no where near true to size. I ordered an XXL and the shirt fits like a medium. I can still wear it but I'll have to wear an undershirt cause it can't button over my chest."
3.0,Doesn’t look like the picture. There is no structure. Color is off.
3.0,"It’s ok, but years ago the quality of this brand was much better!"
3.0,Very light and comfortable but runs small
3.0,"Print differs from pic. Also, unless you have very narrow shoulders, the &#34;off shoulder&#34; part doesn't work and it looks like a regular shirt which you've pulled off of your shoulder (HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!) Bought 2, am returning 1!"
3.0,Very cheap material. Very thin. Not worth the money for this.
3.0,"This was not a sturdy chain, ended up breaking."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2d07a3a57999450beb45966014e52033]] I saw this and thought it was so cute to carry my sunglasses around in. Unfortunately when I got the case I realized it didnt fit hardly any of my sunglasses. It did fit my favorite pair but barely. You can see in the video that you have to bend the case around the hinge of the sunglasses to fit it correctly. You need a really big pair of sunglasses for the case to actually fit. Really wanted this to work because I loved the concept of the case but it just doesn’t fit.
3.0,I returned it when I found out that I would have to iron it
3.0,material is impossible to get wrinkles from packaging out of. top part does not close as in picture so it needs an undershirt.  belt is way shorter than in picture. waist seam end right under chest instead of at waist. would get a size up
3.0,"My robe came in with holes in the material. I'm hoping its just a mistake bc the robe is very soft & I like the look of it. I've sent in for a replacement, hopefully the next will be better quality."
3.0,Loved the color and feel of the skirt.  The lining was very short and clingy to the skirt; tend to rise up with the skirt.
3.0,Not too bad. BUT not good enough as expected.
3.0,I really like this band but one of the side leather straps broke off on the first time wearing it. Slipped right out of the clasp part. Now I’m afraid the other part will too. It’s really the most comfortable watch band I’ve had and it looked great until it broke. I don’t know if I just got a loosely made one or what but I’m disappointed.
3.0,"This umbrella is pretty. And it seems to protect from the sun. But it is quite flimsy--it doesn't feel very sturdy. I've used it several times already since I got it, in the rain and for sun protection while walking. And in the rain several times I thought it was going to break from a slight rainy wind. I'm in Miami where we get major thunderstorms, and it's definitely not going to survive for long."
3.0,Fits small to size.  If I was one to order this again..I’d definitely go a size bigger than your normal size.  Quality is cheap and honestly don’t recommend it.
3.0,"Very beautiful, fit just as expected. Only problem is i had to find and pay someone to sew the rest of sequence on the waistline of skirt and around the top where seller didn't finish."
3.0,I wear a 2X and that’s what I bought. Very small and had to return it. I needed 1to2 sizes larger.
3.0,Color not gold
3.0,Very pretty top!! I'm 5'10&#34;. The shirt was longer than expected. I got an XL as I'm a size 16 so it was also too big. I gave it to a bustier 6'1&#34; woman that I may fit.
3.0,Cute but too short. Returned the shirt
3.0,Thankfully it was inexpensive as I have it in my charity give away.  Way too clingy for my taste.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Resonable price<br />Convient 2-pack<br />Looks like the actual product photo<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs better polarization, driving near sunset was miserable.<br />Smudges easily, so be careful with make up and dirty fingers"
3.0,"These are nice loafers for the price but they are Cheaply made. Also, they run very big so order a size down."
3.0,"I was disappointed in the picture. The graphics were nowhere near as sharp as the picture made it look like. I was looking forward to this, and it just wasn't as nice as the picture. It was soft and silky and comfortable, though. But with a pixelated picture, I just can't see wearing it."
3.0,Shipped pretty quickly which was great but I literally lost this the same day I got it. It kept slipping from my nose so that really sucked. But it was definitely cute. The only reason why I'm not too pissed about losing it because I ordered other clip ons from Forever 21.
3.0,"This is just okay for me.  I much prefer the Luma Cinch.  It's comfortable and adjusts well, but I feel that it's overly complex for what it is.  I also detest that the camera swivels on the attachment point.  I much prefer the strap connection to an Arca-Swiss plate like the Luma.  YMMV..."
3.0,I ordered the Ballet Pink color. I received a two tone peach and weird pink colored outfit. Not even close to the picture as advertised.
3.0,"I like the color of the belt. However because there is no &#34;cap&#34; at the end of the belt, the frayed end, snags on things and string gets pulled out of the belt."
3.0,There is way too much excess fabric around the toes. Not my favorite pair of compression socks.
3.0,One or two would have been fine and better made like ones for sun glasses.
3.0,These are cut extremely large.  I’m 110 lbs and 5’4” tall.  If they made a XXS it could of fit.  Nice soft material and cute print.  Heavy fabric for cold nights!
3.0,"Love the color and casual elegant style, but the top is too short. Pulling the top up far enough to properly cover the chest area results in camel toe on the pants.<br />Will be returning."
3.0,"Overall, this is pretty good, especially for the price. The hat is a good weight, warm and has held a good, slouchy but not sloppy, shape all winter. (PNW resident, here!) I use this nightly when I walk my dog and listen to podcasts, about an hour per night, 6 nights a week, and I only have to charge the hat every three weeks or so! (My inner 10 year old is stoked that her future self is Jetson-like enough to need to charge her beanie speaker.)<br /><br />The only qualms I have are that, 1: The speaker/battery is not removable, meaning I’ll either need to hand wash this (not likely unless I drop it in goo or something), or cut a hole in the side to remove the battery to wash it (less than favorable); and 2: The battery/speaker compartment is WAY too roomy, and the piece rotates around constantly, making use of the buttons while wearing tricky at best.<br /><br />Overall, functions great and the battery lasts forever, so I’m not disappointed but I’ll choose a different style next time."
3.0,Nice idea but unfortunately the red scratches very easily as it swings around with keys rubbing against it.
3.0,"Its okay but not great. I ended up returning it. The material is a lot thicker than i expected and its very texured. Not smooth/silky like i thought. I knew itd be uncomfortable/itchy, especially in south florida. But if i lived in a colder area and wasnt so picky, then itd be a good purchse. Its not cheaply made or anything, i just needed something lighter..."
3.0,Runs somewhat large! Also this looks more like a Sunday dress than for a pageant.
3.0,"I really wanted this to work because I love the style. The material was good and it was well made. I am 5'7, 160lbs, 34D, hourglass figure, pretty much average. I exchanged a large for XL but they fit the same. This suit is not built for anyone with curves. If you have bigger boobs than the model it won't work. Problems: suit was very short in the torso, armpit bulge, underboob cleavage at side, squishes down the ladies, difficult to zip up if your shoulders are more broad, rides up in back (probably from being so short, otherwise I think it would stay in place). I wouldn't recommend unless you are petite."
3.0,Beautiful and vibrant. But I ordered a small and they sent a large. I was swimming in it. I Will update review once I receive the correct size.
3.0,Comfy and fits good. But pretty wide and fat looking
3.0,this dress doesn't have pockets and the neck is too high.  I was able to lower the neck line but it is really hot to wear.  I gave it to goodwill
3.0,"Gorgeous design! The floral details and colors are beautiful and I’m excited to use this for a photoshoot! However, the fabric is very uncomfortable and itchy so not something I’d ever wear out."
3.0,Came late but its a cute hat though. Gold really pops
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8218aedd29324006fedb02db606b5637]] I wanted to like it alot. It went up fairly easy, although it was a little heavy on the side that has the umbrella part. Once we had it set up it work smoothly. We set it up with blocks and weights on the base. This didn't matter. The first wind came and toppled it over even though it was against the shed and facing towards the hours so the wind should have had minimal affect on it. We originally got it for the dogs to have a place out of the rain if they went outside and the sun. Now that it got hot again we decided to fix it. Luckily our son welds and fixed the ripped parts of the base together. You can see the bent part on the bottom of the post in the pics. We also bolted the base down this time to help with any wind but with the thinness of the metal I am not sure how much it will help. I do like that you can pull on of the sleeves back and allows the whole thing to fold up fairly tight against it self  and the smoothness of the opening and closing but that is about it. For our next one we will be looking else where."
3.0,These are pretty comfortable.  They seem a little cheaply made.  But they feel pretty good.  I will definitely wear them.
3.0,Pic is bigger than reality<br />Its kind of small
3.0,for the price its great to big though
3.0,Wish it could have been a bestie; not.
3.0,Great idea but the straps they give you aren't wide enough to preform most of the suggested dress wraps.
3.0,This is a beautiful necklace but I apparently missed the length some how. I thought this was going to be extra long so it would hang around my stomach level for tunics and longer tops but it is very short. The length is of a typical necklace. But it is very beautiful and I will definitely be wearing it!
3.0,I was hoping to get more of a cat eye look and these just didn't do the job.  I did keep them because I enjoy the quality of the Valentino glasses though.
3.0,"Really wanted to love this, its really light and pretty..but after wearing for 5 days, I got an infection 😫.  I was hoping for an alternative because my body rejects metal.  Sadly, my search continues."
3.0,I loved this purse backpack when I got it but only after a little more than a month the zipper lining became unstitched and the zipper fell off. Disappointed in the product
3.0,Great quality! But not what I ordered! These are capris Not pants.
3.0,"Terrible....first time I wore the ring one pearl came off and is lost.......i waited to wear the ring and now it's tooooooooo late to return,.........dont buy this ring"
3.0,They are nice but not true to size.  They run small.
3.0,"While this dress fit as expected, the fabric was heavy and VERY wrinkeley.  I ironed it to wear and while getting ready for an event it wrinkled...if you squeeze the fabric in your hand for a few seconds it looks worse than you slept in it."
3.0,These earrings are very pretty but the clasp did not work. I was able to return them with no problem.
3.0,This is a very large mask. Not horrible but it is big. The picture is much cuter than the product. It is a very flat print and not sharp. So I give this an average rating.
3.0,"Smaller than expected, not stretchy."
3.0,Runs a little small otherwise nice jacket. Not quite what I thought as far as material its thin definitely won't keep u warm
3.0,Doesn't really look the same as pic but still nice dress
3.0,color not as seen in picture.
3.0,I am only given this top three stars because the makers of this top considered a large to be a size 6. How absurd is that? I ordered the size 6 and although it did its job a size 6 is in no way a large and even with that being said the blouse was a size 4 at best. I would not suggest purchasing this stop if you are top-heavy or if you are bigger than a size 8 and tops. Other than that it served his purpose and it was cute enough for my party
3.0,"The ring is beautiful,  but the sterling silver on the bottom side of the ring is not very thick and has already began to bend and I'm concerned that it will break before long.....it's sad because it really is pretty."
3.0,"I found these gloves to be so slippery when soapy I returned them. It was hard to hold onto glasses and plates, so before I shattered a glass I sent them back and went back to the basic rubber gloves."
3.0,Sleeves to long.
3.0,"The glass looks as if your not careful they would break, i bought them for a gift but now i wii not give them to anyone  in case the do break & cut themself?  Not a good gift  however they look ok!"
3.0,Returned it. It was too big. I wanted to exchanged it for a smaller size but it was refunded. I'll try looking for a different style.
3.0,Doesn’t works for me
3.0,"As the title says, Depends on your definition of the phrase ""keeps your hands warm."" The best part of these gloves for me is that they fit as expected.<br /><br />Ive worn these gloves for short and long periods of time in varying winter conditions. Snow, sleet, rain etc. I'd say it's water resistant - not water proof. However onto the bad part of this. Would I say it's wind resistant? scale of 1-5. maybe a 2. Would I say it's able to keep my hands warm? at best, and that's pushing it, maybe a 2 and honestly I think that's being generous.<br /><br />I nearly returned them, but I needed to have a pair of gloves to replace the ones that just couldn't hold up any longer."
3.0,Very cute top...comfortable!
3.0,I just didn’t like that the cover wasn’t really staying on and that the little wire thing was very stiff if it was like pure black string it would have looked nice
3.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this! Very cute. Like others said, the straps may not work well with larger breasts. But, I'm a 34D in bras and I found the straps to be okay. They slipped off a few times and were a bit uneven and even drew more attention to my breasts, in my opinion. It wasn't too much of a problem. I had to wear shorts under it, but I don't think anyone really noticed. If you bend down, you could definitely tell the skirt was too short. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying this if you have large hips, because I could barely get this on. It is a bit uncomfortable too at the waist, but not too bad."
3.0,"Purchased this purse for a compact on-the-go bag during a trip. Didn’t end up using it, but will put it to good use in a few months when I go on a longer trip. However, there are a few things worth mentioning after receiving the bag.<br />- Purse was well wrapped in bubble wrap, plastic bag & additional plastic bag.<br />- I’m 5’4. The strap is not long enough for me to wear it cross-bodied at a reasonable height for my liking. I believe 3-4 more inches would be perfect.<br />- The appearance of the bag is great. The inside construction is as expected for construction of lower end bags from China.<br />- There are 3 main compartments. The middle compartment is made by stitching the top zipper compartment to the bottom zipper compartment along the sides and bottom.<br />o The middle compartment is not as big as the pictures show. With the size of the purse, the middle compartment is around 2/3 the size as the zipper compartments. It is not big enough to put my iphone plus in an otterbox case.<br />- In the pictures where there is a girl wearing the purse, she must be a petite, because the purse is not as big as it looks. Pay attention to the size of this purse.<br />- This will make a great purse to match outfits or for a vacation trip where you just want something to put your wallet, purse and some other small essentials. I don’t think it will be ideal for every day use."
3.0,"definitely not an &#34;over the knee sock&#34;  i'm 5'11, average weight and the sock sat directly in the crease of my knee, which is obviously uncomfortable so i had to just fold it down to sit right below my knee cap. not really the look i was wanting when purchasing the socks."
3.0,The XL was much smaller than expected. As a size 16 an XL is usually spot on for me but I could barely get one leg in this dress.
3.0,"Nice gloves for biking and mildly cold weather, however, it does not keep me warm in the winter, and definitely not enough for biking in the winter. The touch pads on the fingers weren't working that well after a couple of weeks, but that didn't bother me that much."
3.0,It runs smalls...
3.0,"I love them, but I am missing an earring."
3.0,"Just received this for Christmas, and had it on my wish list. I'm no expert on watches, but wanted to offer my opinion of this timepiece.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The watch looks great. It's a beautiful design. The two-tone color scheme looks fantastic. And I love being able to see the inner workings move as it operates.<br /><br />Simple enough to adjust the band by removing links. I did this at home with a simple kit.<br /><br />Keeps time accurately. For a mechanical watch, and one that I will be rotating in and out, it keeps time just fine throughout the day.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Will completely unwind overnight. Need to wind it daily.<br /><br />The band is already showing wear within the movable parts of the links. Looks like flaking off a silver coating on the links as they rub next to the brass areas. The band also popped open at the spring-loaded pin on the clasp and my watch fell off. Definitely not a high-quality band. Not sure I'll find a nice replacement for this style watch or not.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great-looking watch. I knew it wouldn't be the same quality of a much higher-priced timepiece, but thought it might hold up longer than a couple weeks before showing wear. We'll see if I can find another band. Unless this week be for special occasions, in not sure I'd recommend this watch for regular wearing."
3.0,Should make a size between med & large
3.0,"Support is good but sock is too short, I am 5'3&#34; and they come about 1&#34; below the knee"
3.0,There seemed to be a hole where a label may have previously been. The dress was cute but the quality was not what I would have expected from Florens.
3.0,"I like the assortment of colors and they are nice and thin, which I wanted.  The seam across the toes is very thick making them uncomfortable on my toes."
3.0,If you wear a size small order it in L! This has to be incorrect sizing as my daughter is tiny and petite and normally a small is big on her. I read reviews that it was sized small so I ordered a medium and I'm glad I did because the medium is tight on her. Other than that it's a beautiful soft and warm coat.
3.0,The skull and heart and 2 separate pieces. The skull often moves so it’s facing backwards. It doesn’t seem to stay facing forward no matter how you try.
3.0,"The robe is nice and thick, but the threads started pulling after a couple of wears.  It is functional but not so pretty."
3.0,Material thinner than my real military belt. It's just ok
3.0,"This necklace was beautiful - it took quite a while to receive, but it made it before Christmas... The one issue I found with this necklace is the adjustment loops were on the same side as the clasp making it not an adjustable chain"
3.0,"Very cute, simple gym shoes. However, they run about a half size too small. Order up."
3.0,"I bought this cap to wear at work (as a Police Officer) because seemed like the same cap I have in the army only in navy blue instead.<br /><br />The color is good, maybe a little bright for most Police uniforms but not so much that you can't get away with it. The only problem is that the cap straight out of the bag is a little too small. It leaves my earlobes exposed to the cold. I tried stretching it out but it seems to just stay the way it is.<br /><br />I wear a 7 1/8 hat so if you have a hat size larger then that I wouldn't recommend this but if you have a smaller head then maybe it will work out for you. I ended up switching to a navy blue under armour hat instead."
3.0,Bought in white and the material is too thin
3.0,"These are nice bags that are generally overpriced at normal retail outlets.  When heavily discounted, they're a steal."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:de153a8880022e7d1c8cc98bcc822435]] It’s very lightweight because it’s cheap plastic but when it lights up it looks cool. But as the other reviews said, it’s way too loud. I even taped some item over the speaker and it is still too loud. Returning it!"
3.0,"Veils are very pretty and arrived surprisingly fast, BUT smelled so bad of mold that I can't use them. Looking for a good way to clean them."
3.0,Wallet is great for cards. However cash can be difficult at times.
3.0,I wanted lime green as displayed butgot another greeen. I received a deep/forest green.
3.0,Ok but runs small. It would probably be better if it wasn't so small for the size. I always order the same size from all companies& this is the first time it's been that far off.
3.0,As with many slippers the toe area is tapered and along with the filing makes for a tight fit.
3.0,Nice fit and feel of material
3.0,Cute idea but shirt super short. Not a good fit. Pants hard to tell front from back. Would not buy again.
3.0,To small.  It is a crepe material with white old fashion buttons not silver as appeared in picture.  Shirt has to be tucked in due to the way it is made at bottom.  I am long waisted and did not have enough to tuck in.
3.0,The shirt is attractive and well made but it was waaay too long and too wide in the sleeves for me.  A taller person (say 5'6&#34; and up) would wear the style well.  I sent it back.
3.0,"Needed some basic tanks for the gym and figured I would give these a try. I really like my 90 degree compression tanks and was hoping these would be comparable, but they aren’t. These are soft and the fit is good, I like that they aren’t super long. The material is not compression, though. It actually feels similar to a bathing suit material."
3.0,"Nice look and fit little tight on the hips if you're a lady but they're ""men's"" so whatever. I'm 5'8 130lbs for reference and Medium works fine.<br /><br />Buuuuut the black panels are completely see-through. So...if you were looking for scandalous spats these are the ones for you! 😈🔥 lol"
3.0,It is very protective but the buttons become harder to use. It also fits a tiny bit loose
3.0,Lenses  were popped out . Why given 3 stars at moment .
3.0,"This hoodie runs very large. I ordered a small and it fits like a medium/large. Other than that, its alright. I don't anticipate it lasting forever. Its quality is not bad but not high end either. I do like the front pocket. It is a good size, I can fit my phone in it, and more if I wanted."
3.0,"These are not great but not terrible either. I bought them for my young boys mostly for around the house and outside.....material is see through, I am sure they won't last long. Slightly smaller that medium normally runs."
3.0,nice and warm but wish if the fur was attached in better way
3.0,Runs really really small order two sizes up at least but the shirt and material are fantastic
3.0,"My only complaint is that the soles do not prevent slips. I have wood floors and these are like ice skates if my kid is running around.  There’s no rubber bottom like a lot of other toddler slippers. Otherwise, it’s a nice  looking product that provides some warmth in the colder months."
3.0,I ordered the warm brown color and its definitely not the same color as the picture. Its several shades lighter and definitely more orange than brown. I ordered a medium and i do like the fit but i mainly bought it for the color so im overall not very satisfied.
3.0,"The fit is nice, but the bottom is definitely see through. I will be returning it."
3.0,"The description, the appealing photos, and story of this bracelet set my expectations quite high; too high, perhaps, since the product disappointed.<br /><br />I found the packaging quite nice, perfect for gifting once the cellophane wrapper around the bracelet was removed (see photo).  The bracelet itself looked well-made, though I did not understand why the logo was placed on the inside of the clasp, where it was hidden from view.<br /><br />It took me several minutes to figure out the magnetic locking mechanism that secured the bracelet closed.  Then, upon trying the bracelet on, it felt like a vice around my 8-inch wrist.  To remove the bracelet, I again fiddled with the clasp for several minutes.  Perhaps it loosens up a bit over time.<br /><br />I laid out the bracelet and found the measurements were made including the clasp, which accounted for its snug fit (see photo).  I could not account, however, for my difficulty utilizing the clasp, unless it had something to do with the arthritis in my hands.<br /><br />I did a bit of online research about the manufacturer, and made a few interesting discoveries.  Despite the use of a logo depicting a Native American and the photos of a young man making these leather goods by hand, the Casisto.J company is based in Hong Kong and manufactures in China.  While the low price told me this item could not be American-made, others may be fooled by the imagery and marketing.  (I include this information so the potential buyers will better understand the product they purchase.)<br /><br />In the end, I elected to give the bracelet away to a friend with smaller wrists than mine.  Alas, he also had difficulty figuring out the magnetic clasp!  All things considered, I would pass on this bracelet and consider something else."
3.0,"This dress is a loose fit (true to description), and is a thin material (in box diagram on description it says thick, this is not true). The sleeves are long, but have the option to button them up, which looks cute. This is too short for me to wear without leggings (as I'm on the heavier side), but I am going to try and pair it with black leggings and boots. I got the dark blue, so I think it will look good with black or brown boots and leggings. I'm mediocre about this denim dress."
3.0,"To bad, beautiful case, face and great mineral crystal, love the band. Trouble is it loses about a minute a day and the self-winding mechanism is not good enough to keep the watch wound. Needs to be wound daily. Other than not keeping good time I love it but after all, keeping time is its #1 function."
3.0,"2020 and Covid have canceled all Christmas parties this year so there is no point in dressing up for the holidays.  So, this kfulemai Women's Christmas Graphic T is perfect for Christmas Eve with my immediate family (with whom I reside). I can be ""festive"" while low key and comfortable on Christmas Eve with a pair of leggings.  The material is pretty soft.  I thought that the sleeves were rolled and stitched into that position from the picture, but it's not.  I would have to do it myself.  I just think a stitch would have made it look a bit more fun than just a plain grey t-shirt with a Christmas tree, but it is what it is.  And it's 2020."
3.0,Very flimsy. Very kool that the ears strings are adjustable but feels like a thong on your face. Shipment delayed several times. Covers face as advertised.
3.0,This ran too big
3.0,The hat is made pretty strurdy but the fur is all jacked up. It was butchered short in random places and the front was sowen down flat. Took me awhile to fix the flattened parts but there's nothing I can do about the jacked up short spots.
3.0,"Much larger than i expected, but very sturdy and looks good!"
3.0,"I love the earrings and I love Silver Forest.  I was unprepared, however, for how heavy they are (at least to me; I like very light earrings).  I have other Silver Forest earrings which are about the same size, but they aren't heavy."
3.0,Loved this so much. The design is super cute and it was fairly comfortable to wear. Unfortunately after a couple months it fell apart.
3.0,"These pajamas are very soft and comfortable, and look beautiful.  However, they fit significantly larger than a similar PajamaGram style I ordered in the same size.  I have found PajamaGram sizing to be very inconsistent for me - sometimes I need a small, and sometimes a medium.<br /><br />My general sizing is typically small, but sometimes medium - so I don't mind being between sizes and needing to do a little guesswork.  It's very frustrating when sizing is not consistent within a brand, though!  With most other brands I am able to figure out which size I need based on a couple of items, then I can stick with that size forever.  With PajamaGram, though, I have to try both sizes for every single thing I order."
3.0,"Tried wearing for several days. I found the material too soft and I did have a problem with briefs riding up my behind a bit. But hey that's just me, these briefs are probably great for others. This seller backs their products 100%, I was given a full refund because I was not satisfied."
3.0,"I was drawn to this bracelet as the shape looks like an eye, and my daughter has a rare eye condition.  The center gem looks like a blue opal that reflects light in an almost 3d type of way.  The clear stones are small but add a lot of sparkle.<br /><br />I was not very impressed with the corded band on this bracelet.  It looks nice, but it is stiff and scratchy.  I also find that adjusting it can be a little tricky, especially when I am trying to tighten it on my wrist with one hand.<br /><br />The bracelet should fit most adults since it can be adjusted to fit.  The excess strings are about 1.5 to 2 inches long when worn at its tightest which might annoy some people, but it doesn’t really bother me.<br /><br />I’m rating this item 3 stars: it’s okay."
3.0,"The neck line is a little irritating even if you don’t tie it. I need the costume, will deal with it.  Other than the neckline the costume is really cute."
3.0,Fabric is very thin.  There was a price tag that said $76.  I would not pay that for this item.  The pattern is not to my taste and would have been better with a white background instead of pink.  I'm a bit larger on top than bottom so I ordered an XL but normally wear an L and the top was still a tiny bit tight across the chest.  Not true to size in my opinion.
3.0,Totally worth the $5 I paid! I got a L/XL and i had to WORK to get into them.. They run a little small.
3.0,This material isn’t the softest but they are ok socks. Also it says ankle soch but they go up further then ankle
3.0,thought the material is lighter than expected its ok but wont buy again
3.0,"Son buenas y fáciles de poner, pero yo soy un hombre de 6 pies ,4 pulgadas, y me queda un poco cortas para mí tamaño"
3.0,"Cute dress, followed size chart and bought a size 6. Arrived quickly but was missing a button . Fit great. Button missing was a miss for me."
3.0,Good for the price. But the lenses chip pretty easily which could be potentially dangerous.
3.0,It’s fine. Nothing special.
3.0,"This is a BEAUTIFUL dress - beautiful, soft, flowy fabric in lovely colors. It fit like a glove - very flattering and plenty of support. The problem? There was a giant (nearly a foot wide!) hole cut out of the skirt. It was so big and so horrible that all I could do was laugh. It took a month and a half for this dress to arrive from China and I am not inclined to pay the shipping costs to return it. I have asked for them to send a new dress and will update my review after I hear back from Customer Service. Were it not for that hole, though, this would be my favorite summer dress. Only wish I got to wear it on my recent trip to Hawaii."
3.0,"They do the job of keeping the mask from your nose and face, but they don't attach to the mask."
3.0,I had to give these to my teenage daughter - fits 2 sizes down- a large is like a small. Nice quality though .
3.0,"This dress is surprisingly flattering. I don't usually wear anything that cinches at the waist or has pleats along the waist, because I don't want my mid section to look bigger. However, the tall ruffled collar, and the long column-like drape, overall, made it quite flattering. I just wish someone would make this dress with a lining that goes all the way down the full length of the outer chiffon layer instead of stopping above the knee. I'd gladly pay a little bit more for that version of this dress. I first bought a light coral/peach color of this dress, but it was SOOOOO obvious where the lining ended, and you could see right through to my legs where there was no lining.  I felt like it looked as cheap as the price.  I then bought several darker colors of this dress to try.  The darker colors made it less obvious that the lining ended above my knee, but it was still bothersome to me. Perhaps if you intended on wearing this only in a dark room, it would be okay.  So disappointed."
3.0,One washing and then they will be leggings and I am not a big girl. I just read they run small so I ordered a 1x because I love baggy sweatpants. They are snug now. I’m a Women’s Size 10/12. 5’7” 133 lbs
3.0,It isn’t the cotton material I love when I wear t-shirts. Looked better in the photo. Going to the return.
3.0,The hat was just ok.  Poorly made.  My husband was disappointed.
3.0,Not bad for extra pair of sunglasses - not best viewing
3.0,Nice but it's not easy to use it I couldn't put it right
3.0,"Like other reviewers , I agree that the sleeves (at the forearms) are very small. The small size keeps the cardigan inching up past just above the wrist, which allows for the butterfly fit of the sweater. It looks pretty cheap, more of a hard t-shirt material. Not super soft nor does it flow nicely. It’s just so-so. I didn’t love it as much as I wanted to."
3.0,This skirt looks odd but it's doable. Make sure u go up a size.
3.0,Bigger than I was expecting
3.0,I bought a medium size and they were to big. Gave me what I call saggy crotch. Gave to a friend.
3.0,"These are very nice jeans, love the style. I wish they fit me properly. You have to be very tall and slender like a pencil to look good in these jeans. I’m a little curvy not much at all and these jeans made me look like moose. Lol. So if you are tall and slender these will look great on you! If you are not don’t bother."
3.0,It looks kinda cool but you can tell it's cheap when you feel it.
3.0,"True to size, very thin, material is not comfortable, after about 2 wears & washes they had a hole in them."
3.0,Perfect color match to picture.  But this girl is shorter than I thought.  This was way short for my daughter but we got a slip extender.
3.0,Quality is not the best.
3.0,This dress wasn’t accurately pictured. I’m 5’6 and this thing was touching the floor. The “jacket” was really long also. Kind of made it appear frumpy. Just not for me.
3.0,Breathable material but synthetic. Love the fit. I ordered the red and white flower dress in medium and I’m 5’4 150 lbs. Dress went down to mid thigh. Love this dress but wish it was about $10 cheaper because the material quality isn’t super fancy. Will be ordering in more colors tho.
3.0,"I bought these for my husband.  He has a small head/narrow face.  These are a little big, but it wasn't worth returning.  He tends to lose sunglasses that look expensive - and at the moment, he can't find these --- so . . ."
3.0,"This is a cute shirt. . .  BUT . . .  it has a couple of big issues for me. Although the polyester, rayon, spandex blend material is soft and stretchy and the puffy sleeves are lovely, I won't be wearing this shirt for two reasons. First, the square neck exposes both of my bra straps, and the neckline does not lay flat across my chest. It creates a huge gap that exposes a little too much. The neckline dips much lower than it looks in the advertisement photo. This t-shirt might be better suited for someone with a bigger chest. The top of the t-shirt just doesn't sit well on me,  a 36C size. The rest of the shirt, however, drapes well and is very cozy and comfortable.  The stripes and the puffy sleeves are adorable, and the stitching is solid. It launders well, too, but the dryer could not shrink the neckline. Hope these details help you to make an informed decision."
3.0,"I'm 5'4 157 and curvy, I wear a 36 DD and bought an extra large, this shirt fit bigger in the waist, and small in the hip area, so not very form fitting/flattering. But it's comfy. And I love the colors. It fits small so buy up a size."
3.0,"This 55% cotton/45% polyester Henley is soft and comfortable, and initially fit as expected, however, it shrank more than my average long sleeve after washing and drying. I ordered a size medium like I usually do (6 foot one, 170 pounds, slim build). It is well hemmed and without defects, irregularities, or loose threads. At $22, I feel like this is an average price. Overall, it’s still wearable, but it’s just too bad it shrank. 3/5 stars."
3.0,Good quality just small
3.0,Nice Top.  But skirt too thin and a bit small. Buy two size up!  I bought a size 4. for my 2 1/2 yrs. granddaughter.<br />I think she would do well with a 5/6 size.
3.0,"My mom's broke within a week, I think she had to make it too large (she's about a ring size 9).<br />Cute but not for everyday wear."
3.0,The silicone glue inside each cup gets lose easily and it starts to come apart.
3.0,Am only collecting these for the butterfly theme I am going for . Love the color though . yada yada
3.0,"I received a pink and black instead of purple,but I still like it."
3.0,"The very, very thin fabric makes this useless even layered. Other than that it looks warm in the picture but is not....it’s ok."
3.0,I think that this dress is absolutely gorgeous! I don't have many issues with the dress except that the slip underneath is short even with wearing spanx underneath. The straps also came undone a lot leaving lots of sideboob to be seen. Very cute dress but there are some issues when you're a bigger girl.
3.0,Super cute! Material was just a little itchy for my goddaughter so will use for small doses of dress up.
3.0,"It's too short and/or too long. Just an awkward length.  The waistline wasn't flattering, either."
3.0,"Very nice design but the are pink and not yellow gold, the color is not real in the pictures."
3.0,They are cute and super lightweight but the layers of paper seperate so they don't hold up well.
3.0,"The hat was intended for a man,  but it's way too small.  Would have been a great gift"
3.0,"Loved the necklace.  Was what I expected. Unfortunately, I don't believe the clasp was good as the necklace was lost during the first 2 hours of wearing.  I'm assuming it just came undone; or that it broke and I was not aware of."
3.0,Turning color would no purchase again.
3.0,This is a cheap ring so it's exactly what this is. Warning it runs small so go up a size since there are no half sizes available. I bought two rings in different sizes one for me and one for my wife and neither fit on the finger we wanted it to even though we bought our right sizes.
3.0,While I love the cut and material it runs very small
3.0,"Size fit fine.  I typically wear a Small or Medium in bottoms, and I ordered the Medium.  I'm 49, 150, 5'3&#34;, fitness instructor & runner (I know these stats help others pick the right size).  BUT...what I disliked was the cheap cotton blend with NO support (except on the waist).  I need more support everywhere from these when running or jumping around in a fitness class.<br /><br />What I did like, the HIGH waist band.  I've never seen one so high, I wish other workout pants had a waist this high.<br /><br />What I would like to see?  These shorts in a spandex type fabric.<br /><br />Length was fine, they creep up a tad when running -- and I'm a darn short gal to start with, so that surprised me.<br /><br />Three stars is generous in my opinion."
3.0,not that tight... needs more compression
3.0,They were exactly as pictured except I got two CZ pairs instead of opal/cz like I asked for. Other than that I would’ve given 5 stars. I really wanted the opal pair more than the cz.
3.0,Pros - Does the job as fast as you can perform it.<br />  A cheaper alternative to giant expensive injectors.<br /><br />Cons - Kinda a slow job to perform and sometimes turns your 100 into a regular size by tearing the cigarette.
3.0,This one was just way too big for what it should have been sized. It did not even look good on. I sent it back immediately.
3.0,There is no way these large size shorts are 12 to 14. At best they’re a size 8.
3.0,"3D Bracket does help keep cloth off your face, but for me does not help with the fogging on my glasses.  I still need to attach a pipe cleaner or something to help with that.  And after trying to use it for a while, came to conclusion that it is way too small for an adult.  Fits grand daughter ok."
3.0,"Not tapered and the size chart is off.  Ordered a 2xl based on the size chart, but really need an xl."
3.0,Pajamas were very cute & good quality but ran small. I ordered a 2T and the shirt was over an inch shorter than other 2T pajamas my son has. I would recommend ordering up a size for anyone who is looking to order these jams.
3.0,"Doesn't look fabulous as the picture described, was wrinkly, thin and looked cheap."
3.0,"Definitely less cute in person /has less form than the pictures in my opinion and one of the straps broke 30 minutes Into wearing it...also, I wasn’t fond of the fact that the buttons don’t unbutton"
3.0,"I loved the style and it was good quality, unfortunately it was way too big"
3.0,A bit larger than expected.Too large to wear to  work but a fun addition to my collection of interesting earrings
3.0,"These earrings are a little expensive for what they are. I got them for my daughter-in-law who just gave birth for months ago. The baby has a good grasp so dangling earrings and necklaces are out.<br />The presentation for $32 is the earring wrapped in cellophane inside a change purse.<br />As for the earrings themselves, the stones seem to be in the rose gold setting correctly. I really don't like how they look. The rose gold looks painted on.  The is one large stone that has some shimmer. Then there are four white gems in each corner."
3.0,Velcro is already falling off and they have no grip so unless your house has carpet I wouldn't get them. But my 17 month old loves them
3.0,"I love these earrings, the only issue (that makes them 3 stars) is that they flip. The design is weak. The tassles are sitting on the chain, so the flip over and move. It is very distracting to the person lookin' at ya. I make jewelry, so I had to modify mine so they don't sit on the chain. They are lovely, just not designed well."
3.0,"Again, this dress disappointed me. It also did not come with a belt loop so the belt will slide down when wearing. Same fit as the other one I bought. No shape to it until you tie the belt. It is polyester and not cotton. I do love the pattern and the dress but some minor changes would help the dress. If you are looking for something more fitted find something else."
3.0,"I have a 2020 Honda Civic and the panic button on the key is covered and you can’t use it. Pretty time consuming to get on, so I’m sure it’ll be hard to get off. Very cute!! I just got it today, so I’m not sure on the durability. Also, I’m not sure what the pink braided part is for, because it definitely doesn’t fit around my wrist."
3.0,Great fit but NOT a capri - 3 inches longer than all my others - will keep need for phone
3.0,"Heavy material, wider at the waist. Didn't  like the fit."
3.0,"I’m 195 lbs 6’ and I have a big ol head that’s too large for the common hat; this hat is for a dude that’s 6’4” 350lbs, perhaps if people call you Big Johnny, It’s huge. I have to return it. However It’s a nice hat!"
3.0,"These fit similar to ray bans, might be a little smaller. Quality is what you would expect for the price. Came with what I'm guessing is some kind of glue stuck to the frame though, its a red hard dot."
3.0,A fine looking watch band and when they say XL; believe it. I’m a big guy but this was nearly too big for me. I am using it as a dog collar for my Great Pyrenees so he can keep track of time. He has only good things to say about it.
3.0,"I have just started using reading glasses and I like to have a lot of them lying around. The colors on these it seemed appealing. However, they are a very cheap quality and break easily. The material that they are made from his light and flimsy. I would not recommend these."
3.0,"I really like these pants, they fit well and are really comfortable. The one thing that I don’t like is the buttons aren’t sewn on that well. I have had to resew the buttons on the fly on the pairs that I own. I will look into the zipper fly that these come in, if I get another pair."
3.0,I like the material used. Its perfect for outdoor wear like fishing.
3.0,"Compression does not appear to be as strong as some of the other 2xu compression pants I've purchased in the past, but still adequate - and super cool print. I love the blue ;)"
3.0,Smaller then I thought they would be and the post bends easily
3.0,"I like that it's lined and the hidden zipper behind the toggle buttons. I like how the hood is attached to the sweater. However, I dislike that the arms of the sweater being VERY itchy and the sweater took too long to arrive!"
3.0,"Purchased 5 ""Large"" shirts.  Three are fine. Two are marked large, but are huge, more like 2X. The shirts are very comfortable though."
3.0,Nice cap and well constructed. Unfortunately it is a bit tight and the chin strap is far too short to actually buckle down. I'd recommend ordering a size larger than normal to get a good fit.
3.0,"One charm came with only one loop, so not a connector like the rest. Another one has the gold foil along the edge coming off. So those two are unusable.<br /><br />These are definitely plastic and look like plastic but they will work for what I’m using them for."
3.0,"These are great for running on a chilly evening. I wouldn't recommend them for weather under 32 degrees, though, since they are thin."
3.0,"After removing lots of lose thread, I tried them on. They were a bit small. They are just underwear- not what I expected."
3.0,I bought these shorts in several colors for my boyfriend and the covers for the draw string have fallen off almost all of them. They fit fine.  The drawstring often comes untied I assume just because of the type of material it’s made out of? And they’ve already got several snags and holes from just regular daily wear. Sadly won’t be buying again even though I have several friends who like this brand a lot
3.0,It's actually cheaper looking than I thought but I only wear it before I get in the pool so it's okay
3.0,"These things sound like the elastic is already so old, the way it creaks when you pull them up. The tops roll over worse than the cut-off sleeves on an 80s-style muscle shirt, and finding the right fit is too time-consuming for being, well, socks. But once I get these on they are fairly comfy. I was mainly looking to avoid seams, but if I was concerned about finding thick boot socks, I would keep looking, if I were you. These are pretty thin."
3.0,The item is very heavy and uncomfortable to wear. I can only stand to wear it for a short period of time.
3.0,Cute earrings but very small in size.  You can barely make out the bear design when my ten year old wears the earrings.
3.0,"They are adorable but will smell up a room, for sure, like chemicals."
3.0,"It fits well, but not as expected results"
3.0,"I wanted so much to give this a better review, but it appears to be a bit cheaply made, but for the price I paid I guess that should be expected."
3.0,The rubber grip is visible when wearing and it still doesn’t really stay in place unfortunate. For the price I thought it would work better. Otherwise decent construction quality and a nice performance fabric material.
3.0,The size of the bands was too small
3.0,"Firstly I received a lace blouse instead of mesh.  It's still pretty but it's not what I wanted. Based on the reviews I ordered a size up, I should have ordered my size which is a 6."
3.0,Son loved the shoes. Unfortunately the switch to turn the lights on broke off. The switch (button) is in a bad place on the shoe (in the shoe on the side). His ankle accidentally kept turning on the lights when he walked. Would have been better if it was built into the tongue of the shoe.
3.0,It’s cute but it’s too heavy for my ears.
3.0,Nice bracelets and the leather seems ok for the price.  The only negative is the craftsmanship was not good. Opened the box (which was really nice) and when I tried on the bracelet it immediately came apart. I had to glue the leather bands back in myself.
3.0,I am 5'3 too long.
3.0,"Very pretty, little small on top. Gave it to my neice. Looks great on her!"
3.0,The picture on the shirt is blurry my husband bought a similar shirt from a different seller and the picture is very clear I’m so bummed
3.0,"Very, very thin."
3.0,"I am a size 8 in this style in other colors, but the grey is disappointingly snug."
3.0,Very tight in the chest.
3.0,"Okay, I've got to start out by saying that I'm a big guy, so my noggin is big too. The glasses did not fit well at all.<br />1. They forced by prescription glasses into my eye lashes, which are very long. (I have dreamy blue eyes)<br />2. The plastic of the sunglasses is abit wavy, not a good thing."
3.0,Material peeling off of outside of case.  Started peeling after about 3 weeks of Being on the phone... other than that fits good
3.0,Cute earrings but they came with the blue crystal out of the setting!
3.0,"Swimsuit looks like the model picture. It runs big.  My daughter is a 6 I ordered a 6 and it was baggy at the crouch, underarms, and bottom areaa. If your child is fuller all around it may be a true size.  I had to return the product."
3.0,Fit oddly. Waist is to high.
3.0,Daughter said they were larger than she expected.
3.0,Not a bad pair of pants. Not the best quality not the worst. Decided to return them.
3.0,I wanted a summer dress this dress is made out of really heavy material  will not be able to wear it during the summer months  more for winter wear
3.0,Didn't like the bra insert. No real support.  May want to order in a larger size.
3.0,"I wore one of my shirts to a workout, looked in the mirror & I looked like the mother on that cartoon from yrs ago ""The Jetsons"". (pointy shoulders) They are nice looking shirts but wouldnt get them again."
3.0,Was as expected but it came with a huge stain so I will be returning. I am not even going to try it on.
3.0,So cute love it!!!
3.0,It runs to small for my neck but it's cute.
3.0,"I ordered this because I loved the bow. Figured even if the rest looks funny, it would still be worth the money. When I got it, the bow was actually the size of half my pinky nail. It is so small you cannot tell it is supposed to be a bow. Pretty disappointed."
3.0,"I used these leggings as pajama bottoms. They fit a little closer than I like, but like legging should. I wish they had pockets."
3.0,Nice pants but they were wayyy too long.  I am 5'1 though.
3.0,"Nice earrings but HUGE.  My &#34;bad&#34; for not measuring.  Probably look good on a woman with a BIG head (lol)  PD, SR, CA."
3.0,"This is a cute shirt, seems well made. However it is huge! I mean this would fit a 9 month to year old at least and I got the 3-6 month."
3.0,they fall out of my ears but I solved by taking some plastic backs off of some earrings I had and using those to keep them secure
3.0,The material was not good quality.
3.0,"No give room, somewhat small to be an Xlarge."
3.0,Too small for a mans wrist. This is more for a woman.
3.0,"Ordered one side up and doors perfect. I wanted it a little loose like the picture. Like the material, its very lightweight."
3.0,They are cute but really small. You can barely distinguish what they are unless you’re close.
3.0,It's a good piece of lingerie for the price. Looks cute. Feels nice.
3.0,Definitely size up like 2 sizes.  I was super sad I wear a large and I ordered xl to be safe and it was still too small.
3.0,I thought I was getting the mask that was formed for nose and chin as shown in picture when ordered
3.0,Look great but the arms were a little tight
3.0,"Wish I would have read reviews. Bought for a boy who's parents are not into anything pink. The design has red dinosaurs but the soles and tops of the RAWR dinos is unmistakably dark pink.<br /><br />Just to test this .. we showed them to the child's father without saying a word, and he said ""oh .. isn't that for a girl""? So if you want cute dino boots for a girl (or a boy that likes pink), these are great. We returned them and got the green ones. Very cute and we love them. They are lined and sturdy boots."
3.0,Worked for all intents and purposes but you could still see it if you looked from a near distance
3.0,"Arrived broken, it took a month to get, wasn't worth returning.  Had it not been broken I would have rated it high.  Seemed to be made well, while it was in a padded enveloped, I suspect heavy items were placed on it during the Christmas shipping season which were the cause for the break.  It was really pretty... and had it not arrived broken I would have considered the material high quality."
3.0,The fabric is too cheap very lite I don't liked
3.0,Nice but the write up wiped after two times of wearing..
3.0,Runs big but made of good material.
3.0,Not really looks like the ad pic
3.0,they'd be better if i hadn't lost them . . .:'(((((
3.0,"I could only attached 1 part of the band, which is the one with the holes, and i used another one i also order for the buckle, for some reason this specific item has a hard part inside I just couldn't attached it to the watch, so i order another one from another vendor and it work out perfectly, i have 1 from this order and i attached the other one from my other order. but actually the one from the other order the material it's a little more flexible and softer."
3.0,"Really stiff and short.  Fine quality if that's what you're after but this picture of one one a kids head is deceiving, unless that kid is 3 or 4 years old maybe."
3.0,"Very cute - good quality - but my daughter was disappointed when they didn't fit and we had to return them for an exchange.  She is a size two and I thought I was playing it completely safe by getting her a medium.  Also, I was a little disappointed to find  the exact same pair cheaper at WALMART this week, but we will honor the buy."
3.0,"This is just based on my experience while wearing them, but they dont really reduce glare. However what i found more helpful, at least in my case, they do reduce brightness of the headlights. I wish they would cut back on the glare too but its not like they are prescription so i did get what i paid for and its gonna help alot till im able to make an eye appointment. All in all i do not regret buying."
3.0,"After having this rain coat for just over a year and only wearing it maybe 10 times, I'm having the same problem my last raincoat had. The zipper pulls open at the bottom when wearing it. It pulls open at the bottom while still zipping it. I just want a raincoat that has a good zipper. The coat is great except for the zipper."
3.0,"I love these shorts and wear them all of the time, so I know what size I need. I wear size 18, which is what was advertised. I received 18W, this is about 1 complete size larger. If it was listed this way in the sizes, I would have ordered 16W.  Please correct your sizes, big difference between regular and women “W”"
3.0,Love the dial on the watch but metal band is very light weight too big extra big had to change to the black band . but other than that its a great watch
3.0,Cute shirt but it fits a little awkward
3.0,Cute cut but I was looking for lightweight summer top and this fabric is quite heavy for a sleeveless style so not for me and 90 degree summer days.
3.0,Hard to see out of. but very cute.
3.0,"It's ok. I actually purchased 2 of these dresses in different  colors. The patterns on them look great and the material is light weight. I couldn't pass up $5 dresses.<br />I did notice the dresses did not fit the same. I ordered large on both. One fit perfectly and the other was a little snug. The snug one ended up ripping on the seam under my arm after one wear. I managed to sew it back up, but I'm still worried it will rip again."
3.0,"Sequins fall off pretty easily, but the skirt is so shiny. I want to love this, but it is sadly only ok."
3.0,"They fit great and look nice on! Very comfortable with breathable but also very thin fabric. The fabric lost the review a star as I have other pants with the same style but better quality materials utilized. The real issue I have with these pants is the pocket is on the side, which means every time you sit down everything falls out of them: car keys, pens, phones, credit cards, pretty much everything just slips out. So if you don’t need pockets these are great and I would 100% recommend. However I do, and so I will not be repurchasing."
3.0,"I would love to but these again in white gold or sterling silver. I wanted to wear them every day. But had to stop, not long after getting them, because they were discolored and turning my ear gray."
3.0,"I love the color of this jacket but it's not exactly like the picture it showed. The texture is strange feeling, and when you have it on and tie the belt around you it won't stay in place, it keeps slipping down and then the coat bags down. I think it needs a button or hook and eye on the inside to keep it together. It also is not lined so I'm not sure you can call it a trench coat. I'm not thrilled with it but my granddaughter wanted it so I've given it to her. It looks very stylish but not exactly as pictured."
3.0,I returned this bag.  Kenneth Cole makes great lugguge.  I was replacing a bag that looks just like this but the measurements were smaller than described and would not fit my needs.  It is a great bag just was too small.
3.0,"Didn’t really fit my face, glasses ran quite small, more for a really thin or child’s face.<br /><br />Great quality though"
3.0,What you end up getting is REALLY small and it feels flimsy.  It's pretty but not much for many uses.  I regret spending money on this product.
3.0,Just ran too small for me.
3.0,"The reason I'm gibing this product only 3 stars is because due to the color (white) and the thinness of the fabric, even with nude colored no-show underwear on I'd never be able to wear these outside of the house. I would say the white is not squat proof. Otherwise they are a good length and I'm sure would be a very good work out short in a color other than white."
3.0,Wish these slipper socks were made from a lighter fabric.  These were purchase with the idea they would be worn in the summer.  These are way too hot for summer.
3.0,This wasn't the quality I wanted for my daughter's wedding. I returned it.
3.0,"Shipping was not speedy...had almost forgotten about it!  Leather quality is as expected, but beading Very cheap plastic & thin metal!!  Is adjustable, though, so will use it as an everyday accessory for however long it lasts!"
3.0,"Fit as expected. VERY THIN MATERIAL, not warm, not soft"
3.0,"I love these glasses- except that the lenses scratch very easily, and you’ll be buying another pair in a few months time."
3.0,"I'm putting together a couple of Halloween props together and needed this for a skull.  It's going to work but the 2W speaker needs to be directly wired, due to the plugin jack doesn't put out enough sound with out the use of a amplifier."
3.0,Material wasn’t very nice and ran too big.  Returned
3.0,[[VIDEOID:512d74422de41c07a98f61a17646f65a]] I like the design & color of the letters but overall don’t like the fact that it’s battery operated.The batteries die very quick.
3.0,Very well made. But fits really tight to my face. Feel like a robber wearing a nylon over my face.
3.0,Gathering at the waist was unattractive.
3.0,They shrink again.
3.0,"I bought these since it was advertised as easy on and off however, I was very disappointed they were not easy at all to get on.  I have very heavy calves and it was a struggle!!!!  Also, I had to fight to even get them over the ankle and the foot to get them aligned wasn't easy.  I have always worn compression socks and thought these were different, but they were just as difficult to get on. I wouldn't waste my money on buying them again!!!!!!."
3.0,"Fits my tall curvy frame perfectly, I wear a size 18 and the XL was just right.  Very plastic feel and of course the accompanying stinky chemical smell.  I tested it under the faucet for leaks since I am planning on taking it back packing and need it to work.  The fabric was very waterproof but the seams leaked.I am not going to return it though, because I can apply a seam sealer and it will work fine for the cheap price."
3.0,"Tacky, cheap made"
3.0,"I couldn’t tell which side was the front or the back of the pants. The top was cute, but the pants were not flattering."
3.0,Runs small but ok.
3.0,There was a tear or rip in the dress along the Front seem  aside from that she just loves the dress. The dress isn’t all what it’s says it is
3.0,"It works for what i need, soft lightweight terry fabric. Downside,  the embroidery on left side is rough and does irritate skin."
3.0,"There are not 20 pairs. Only received 10 pairs!!!<br />Also, too big for my glasses"
3.0,"Arrived quickly. Very pretty & nice quality. It's nice and small as I wanted. Only reason for not giving a 5 star (and this has nothing to do with the seller as they are not responsible for this - they were GREAT)! The cuff doesn't stay on and is hard to adjust (bend) to stay on. I do have very small ears and not much for the cuff to cling to, but it would be nice to wear nonetheless. I am afraid of losing it, it's so pretty."
3.0,"While they work well as a diffuser, they keep falling apart. The metal banking that holds the scent pad, keeps falling off. Super glue works but it’s cumbersome to apply and get it to stick right."
3.0,Sole is kind of hard on the feet.... but very cute
3.0,When we first received it it’s very pretty but after about a month it started to tarnish and I couldn’t even clean it with the jewelry cleaner. I don’t know if this is why it’s not available anymore but not a real quality product.
3.0,no stretch...flairs out a bit...its nice but I prefer stretchy
3.0,Metal was tarnished black
3.0,My daughter loves the hat! The only problem is when she went to put it on the 2nd time the top of the hat was undone. The company did send a replacement and it is fine as of right now.
3.0,"Three stars for the knee pads, nice color, and fabric. I was kind of disappointed when I put these on, though. I'm pretty petite, so I ordered a small. I'm pretty much sure I ordered the correct size (anything smaller would not have fit around my hips) yet the legs were noticeably baggy in places!! Not sure if me or the breeches, but it just didn't look right. On the fence about trying a different size"
3.0,If you're into ethnic jewelry then it's worth it especially for the inexpensive price.
3.0,"Ordered in the size I would have expected to wear. It was a cute dress, just not cute on me. Not very flattering. Might have been better in one size bigger, but also might have looked like a potato sack, too. Not a bad dress, just no so great for me. I wish it would have been because it was definitely comfortable and versatile. For comparison purposes, I'm 5'3 approx 200 lbs. 40B bust, 39"" waist, 42"" hips."
3.0,I think I vaguely recall seeing reviews about the wrap.  I agree that its very confusing. Its super short in the croch area. It just was not flattering on me so I'm returning it
3.0,"Good enough. Appears that build quality is low. Pad pockets are too small, inner and outer layers seem misaligned. Fit is a bit weird.<br /><br />Still enjoying riding it it though. Much lighter than leathers. Not completely wind proof either, which is nice on warm days."
3.0,Ordered a large because im a 12 pant size (USA) and could bearly even fasten the 1st button. Cute skirt and good material though. You have to button all the buttons.
3.0,Very cute slimmer belt.  The interlocking part interlocks securely... stretches out easily after a just a few wearings though.
3.0,"Super cute, but some issues:  The zipper in the back extends way to far up, cuts into my neck, and snags on my hair. It flares out from a waist hem that's just a bit too high. I have a very short torso, and the waist hem was still above my true waist. It just looks kinda weird. Also, the edges are unfinished; it looks like someone just cut it with scissors."
3.0,Returned item due to it being too large.
3.0,"My husband works outside during the day, in muddy conditions and will only use a velcro wallet so he doesn't lose anything.  These fit perfectly."
3.0,Does not work with square frame glasses
3.0,bought this for my 8yr old who is a gymnast and the charm is way too big. she doesn't even wear it anymore
3.0,"This is very cute but I don't like how the snaps are plastic, they need to be metal. The plastic ones are harder to get apart and then you feel like its going to rip the outfit."
3.0,But I still like it ...
3.0,A common saying but not their official motto...
3.0,"They run small<br />They show no zipper in the pic yet they come with a zipper<br />as it said in the fine print..Total bait and switch !<br />One shoe is tighter then the other,had to have them stretched<br />by local bootmaker . nice boots just a lot of inconsistency's<br />Frye is a mass produced brand I get it but advertising and QC lack........"
3.0,Super<br />I loved
3.0,These earrings are so cute! I got them for myself to wear and keep in. After wearing for about 3 days the back fell off of one and disappeared. I only saved the earring because it got caught in my curly hair.
3.0,Would have been cute if it was actually high waisted but it came up too short.
3.0,"I like the front and form but, carefully look at the back to make sure you want these. Why on Earth did the designers thin the fabric so that the butt cheeks are visible? My husband raved how he loved them on me and I jokingly turned around to reveal the targeted butt cheeks and we both had a laugh. My mistake for not looking more closely. Plus, they reek of chemicals, even after two washes. I had to wash them a third time with baking soda to get the stench out. They do run a bit small too. Go for a size larger than you normally wear if you decide these are the pj's for you."
3.0,"Very cute boots and they are true to size as well. They have a nice grip to the bottom of them.<br />They are pretty comfy as is, but I can see them hurting after a while. There also isn't enough room in them to fit an insole.<br />They are also a little tight on my calves, I imagine after a while the elastic will loosen up and it'll be better. But they sure do stay on your feet! I have to really pull to get them off. So, I advise sitting down to take them off."
3.0,Its great but the green part detached from the white and black and the red stars fade away after some times.<br />#SyrianRebel
3.0,"This dress is a pretty color and a stretchy fabric. It is cheaply made, but if you’re looking for something to wear to one event, it’s a good choice. The only issue I have is that the ruffle was not down all the way down, so that when I put it on it kind of looked like it was dangling from the chest area. I’m not sure if that was a defect or if that’s how it normally arrives. I sewed it down and it looks fine."
3.0,"Cute, when received no box, cheap appearance."
3.0,"Not quite what I was hoping for. They are not very comfortable and many places don't allow the ones with vents, which these have. Hoping I can use them in the shop when wood working."
3.0,recieved item doesn't work.  had to buy bulb or light separately and the handle doesn't work at all without it. so now I'm not sure if this item is actually defective or if i just need to add the other piece first.  il update review once the other piece arrives.
3.0,It is super comfy but too baggy.
3.0,Stars and glitter all came off on first wash.
3.0,I got this for my 9 yr old but its more for a toddler.  It was way too small. Looked nice though. Had to return.
3.0,"The dress color was not as bright as it shows in picture, material was fine though and the length"
3.0,Black rubbing off on both rings now :(
3.0,Too thick for most things I own.
3.0,We're too big. Size chart was unclear
3.0,This is nothing like the picture I am thinking of returning these items
3.0,"Like this a lot. Very comfortable and it looks great. The opening is just a little too big and I'm not small boned. It's fine as long as you have a hair band on it, but if not, it would fall off my wrist. My solution is to hold two thinner band on it instead of one thicker one in case I want to use the hair band."
3.0,"They work great to block the blue rays from my Kindle reader, however they already show an area on the front of the glasses where they are scratched.  I have been careful to not lay them down on their face, so they are very delicate.  I've only had them a week.  Not a good sign for long usage."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but it wasn’t what I expected."
3.0,"Mid toe width is a little small, it is taking a long time to break in. My husband has feet pain, so I wanted to buy him some good quality shoes that would give his feet good support, it is not as comfortable as I expected it to be."
3.0,Not as ergonomic as I thought they would be.
3.0,Very nice glasses one of the rhinestones came out the very first day
3.0,"Year one no problem where comfortable but a little cloudy. Not clear enough to be safe for driving. O.K. For the pool or a ball game.  Year two, They broke.  If I remember right they were very inexpensive ."
3.0,Some threads were already loose but it serves the purpose as a tote to bring drinks inside from the garage.
3.0,It’s sewed together on the side that touches the ear. My little one doesn’t like how it feels.
3.0,Not bad for the price but didn’t come with batteries but  I would buy again plus they came pretty fast.
3.0,"Pretty but tight looking...unless it’s a really wide elastic bracelet, I like the bracelet to fit kind of loosely. This one isn’t very wide (widest one this item sells for) yet fits tight. Comfortable though!"
3.0,Not typical swim shirt material. Seems too thin and fragile. See through when wet.
3.0,"i always wear this size but these fit tight but i used a stretcher and it helps, best to get 1 size larger next time"
3.0,"Color is not as pictured. Mine came in as a bright pink, not a muted red"
3.0,Beautiful design but too small
3.0,Cute dress but very sheer!! Will have to wear a slip!!
3.0,Too small once the beads are on.
3.0,"Since these are pull-on I expected more stretch in the waistband to get over the hips (and, no, I don't have big hips in proportion to the waist). Once on, they fit in the hips and WAS comfortable in the legs and thighs, BUT the waistband was too tight for the size. The picture implied mid rise, but the pair I received was very high risen, especially in the front. I will keep them because it is too much of a hassle to return, but I will wear a long shirt to hide the funky fit on top."
3.0,I like I been looking for my size every where could not find it now I got what I want and it fit me just right 😍😘
3.0,"The shoe fit, but it did not look exactly how I imagined around my ankle. Overall a cute shoe."
3.0,Fits great but the material is really thin. You need under garments that cover your whole body like a slip or spanx and a good bra.
3.0,It was larger & linger than I expected.  The quality was a bit disappointing. It was a gift but I was not happy
3.0,"This was my 4th or of Haflingers, so I was surprised when they didn't fit."
3.0,"I got 2 of these,green and blue multi color. I'm 5'2"", 140lbs and 36C.<br />I had read others saying the under pit area was baggy and for the XL size they were right.<br />The pics attached are post sewing adjustments by me,they weren't super neat but it worked.<br />The blue multi dress also fit a bit baggy up top but it wasnt as noticable due to the pattern. Maybe the non buttoned ones would not show the design error as much.<br />So I liked the dress but I'd rather pay alot less($8-10) for something I would have to sew to fit."
3.0,Watch has recently started running slow.
3.0,"Wife has a tendency to misplace sunglasses. So order in bulk at least annually. These are good for price paid, without being concerned if lost or broken."
3.0,GREAT FABRIC
3.0,I bought this backpack for a simple 3 day trip. One strap popped odd before we even left. There is other areas where it seems to be tearing at the seam. It sits pretty low but I also could have adjusted the straps better. There is also a hole in  the fabric in the pocket at the top. However overall it's pretty ok. It manged to carry about 50lbs of weight. It could have more straps and stronger material.
3.0,The quality is good.  They seemed to stretch out very quickly.  I would say a half size.
3.0,My husband really enjoys these slippers. He said he would rather them have an enclosed heel but other than that they are very comfortable and soft. He wears them every day/ night since he got them from my sin and I Christmas day.
3.0,too narrow for me but the lens is great. my wife loves them
3.0,"The length of sleeves and shirt itself is perfect. Too tight in the armpit, so if that bothers you, order a size up."
3.0,These are really pretty earrings but the earring backs are made of very cheap metal. I would buy repalcement backs befpre wearing these.
3.0,"Even wearing pants high enough to cover my belly button (like I failed to notice in the picture) it looks way smaller than advertised. Fits fine, I suppose, but I will be returning it. Also you'll need nipple covers if you couldn't tell."
3.0,"Kinda ok, a bit stiff and dorky looking. I have short hair so probably best for people with longer hair!"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this swimsuit. It was the perfect length, & great quality. Unfortunately, the 3X, which almost always works for me, was too small for me. I would still recommend it for smaller girls, but you may need to order a size up."
3.0,Cute but I have had to bbn put the dangle pair back together after taking out of package.
3.0,"The plastic part is cheaply made. Sometimes the nozzles get stuck and it takes some doing to get it unstuck. The glass bottle are beautiful and the nozzles fit well onto the glass. One of the 3 bottles leaks at the nozzle. It works well enough for me, but I recognize that these are not high quality."
3.0,Was excited to order some holiday themed earrings.  A bit disappointed when I received them that they were not as pretty as I was expecting.  The backs of the earrings are unfinished and white and since these are dangling earrings it is very noticeable and obvious.  I painted the backs of the earrings with red nail polish so they now looked finished and cute.
3.0,"really cute mask. great for a costume or masquerade. only downside is that the nose bridge is horrendously small. because of its small size, about 1/4 of my eyes are covered by the mask. if it was a bit larger there, it would fit perfectly."
3.0,shorter than expected.  I would buy sticky tape to keep the shoulders up. They will fall without the tape.
3.0,"The top is pretty and it came as promised, but unfortunately the kurta was too small for me so I gave it away."
3.0,"It is a cute hat, but I have a very large head and it doesn't fit quite right. This is not Vans' fault. It is a well built hat and a cute design. I just have a giant ass head.  Big headed folks beware."
3.0,It wasn't the color I was looking for. I was looking for a dark brown. The quality of the scarf was very good.
3.0,The dress looks nice size true to size. The only one thing I questioned is why lining when the fabric is not sheer . Consider that the front has three layers of fabric for a summer dress? I had to cut off the whole lining.
3.0,"i ordered a 3x and it was the size of a med-large. nice clean packaging, looked exactly like the picture."
3.0,Its pretty neffty the only reasone gave it three stars is that its pretty rough to push the button from time to time
3.0,Wish it came in adult size.  Too small to fit my ties. The skull looks more like a black spec
3.0,"Bought as a gift for a child. She needed a larger backpack and this one specifically stated it was a woman’s size bag.  I feel like this one might be good for holding an elementary school lunch. Sandwich, juice pouch and maybe space for a few other things. About half the size of a standard shoe box."
3.0,Material is very comfortable and breathable but does not have enough layers to be effective
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f1cdbdf62378aa8ed602470420923f9b]] Overall I love this boot looking at them straight on.  I ordered 1 size up due to having a wide foot shed extra wide calf’s.  Some residual glue is left on the boot but can be cleaned up.  The pattern is off and leaves some places on the boot bare.  For $67 and because I know how to apply rhinestones myself, I think it’s an okay buy.  I would’ve been pissed had I paid much more."
3.0,Didn’t like the way the fit me<br />I’m to short for high waist shirts
3.0,"it's ok although it didn't fit me as I expected, it's cute.  I gave to my granddaughter."
3.0,"Let me start off by saying they work. I like wearing them at night because they absolutely reduce the glare of headlights in oncoming traffic. However, they do not fit my small head, and because of that, I'm getting a glare in other ways.<br /><br />When I'm following another car, it's like I'm seeing double of their tail lights, and it's very annoying. I've made sure there are no smudges on the glasses and cleaned my windshield, but I still get this off putting double glare from tail lights. It's almost dizzying. I'm going to try a different pair and see if they fit better and do not make me see double the lights."
3.0,"Loved it, all it needed was to be dry cleaned to get rid of the wrinkles, but it’s way too see through with the white color!!"
3.0,"It looks great, but the keychain part was broken. I was super bummed. The pendant was fine so I just put it on another keychain, but I was disappointed."
3.0,"I absolutely fell in love with this mask, it was perfect for my event. However I woke up this morning with a rash all around my eyes, under eye and eyebrow area. I'm so annoyed, there was no way I could have expected this reaction so just beware."
3.0,"The exterior is great.  The bag is a little heavy.  The opening is too small.  The zipper placement prevents a wide opening.  I am thinking I will take this to a leather repair shop and have them put a different zipper in it so the opening can be bigger.  The exterior of the purse leaves one to believe that the interior is roomy--not true.  If you're looking for a classic satchel, this hits and misses."
3.0,"The pendant itself is beautiful and just what I was wanting. My issue is that the listing clearly says it comes with a 20 inch sterling silver chain, and it doesn't. We bought this as a gift, and when it arrived it included a yellow metal chain that was about 16 inches. I'd chosen this listing specifically because I'd wanted that particular chain (20 inches sterling silver) to go with the pendant. Amazon told me to return it and order again. I did and again was sent a beautiful pendant with a short yellow metal chain. At that point I didn't have the time to order it again (especially when it looked like I'd most likely just get the same thing again anyway), so the gift was given as it was. I don't know if it is mislabeled or what, but it wasn't as advertised and the details matter."
3.0,Very loose fitting.  Small felt like a medium.
3.0,Sleeves too short! Loved the sweater but the sleeves could be another inch or 2 longer.
3.0,I love this dress so much! BUT it ripped down the back seam within a week. It's such a great style and yet so fragile.
3.0,The cloth is very thin.
3.0,Great overall just wish they still came in all white
3.0,Love the colors and the design!! I received many card for confidence
3.0,"Got these for my 4 (almost 5) year old daughter, sunglasses are must have in soCA.  She loves them, fits great. Flexible and durable enough for kids use."
3.0,"I've never wrote a review before so the first you review you see from me on this product was a typo. The swimsuit is a great material. But I'm 5'0 and about 132 lbs, (I ordered a Large) everything fits nice but it feels a little short on me. Like I can't stand up straight when I have it on. When I tug the swimsuit down.. It moves the breast pads.. I don't think it's really proportioned right. Or maybe I just a defected one."
3.0,"if you are size C+ and bigger, this would not cover you"
3.0,Too large for my face ..
3.0,"I wasn’t impressed with this nightgown. There is a horizontal seam on the back just above the shoulder blades that is quite pronounced, meaning you can feel it all the time. I’m not particularly sensitive to seams, but this was very irritating.<br /><br />Additionally, though the material was a lovely, smooth texture, I found that it was a bit sheer over my breasts. I’m a 36DD, so this might not be a problem for people with smaller busts.<br /><br />All in all, it wasn’t an awful piece of clothing, but the defects were enough to return it. However, I still like this brand a lot: I have other nightgowns from them that are wonderful. I think this specific piece was a one-off."
3.0,Very cheaply made. They seem like they would fall apart if I dropped them.
3.0,Thin fabric. Nothing like what the photo shows. Runs very big. I ordered medium and it was really big. It was like the size of about XL. My bust is 32ddd and waist 28.
3.0,"They are, as advertised, non-polarized. I had hoped that this would allow me to see the car's dash display more clearly, but it didn't. The lenses are very large, and the product is surprisingly heavy. The clip on mechanism worked fine and it flipped  up easily."
3.0,By using their sizing chart for this shirt i believe runs small.<br />I ordered size medium too tight in the shoulders and the arm lenght was too short.
3.0,Sent back because was to long.
3.0,"Pros: The glasses have a lot of color options which are cool, the batteries are common to find if they were to die.<br /><br />Cons: the width is huge so you definitely need to add a strap to the back. I suggest gluing an elastic strap to hide under hair. There is no indention for it to actually sit on your nose. Lastly the glasses came a little scuffed in spots, I am assuming from the material it’s constructed from."
3.0,The color is a dull blue. But other than that love it.
3.0,Fell apart quicker than expected. May be due to high usage but otherwise not sure what happened
3.0,I bought this for my 8 year old niece. The sunglasses were tiny! Like fit my 2 year old tiny! The bag was cheap plastic and nothing special at all. She liked so I guess that’s all that matters.
3.0,The dress was too big. If you normally wear XL get a Large
3.0,Used as a light weight mask.The material was a bit uncomfortable.
3.0,"Bought these in Black Shinepeacock. I love rayon harem pants for dancing because they breathe and get softer with each washing. One thing I wish for this particular style is that they would take more care with matching the pattern on each leg. Mine have the burst design clear and centered on the front of one leg and mostly wrapping around the back of my other leg. As a result, they don’t look very symmetrical. Also, I would prefer multiple size options rather than one size fits some."
3.0,Super nice wallet package is amazing but way thicker than it appears in the description and pics. If you’re looking for a thin wallet do not buy this one.
3.0,"Cute shoe, like that straps are adjustable,  however, sole is hard."
3.0,"Broke quickly..While I know its 10 dollars, it shouldn't break in 5 weeks. Also when it came in, it had a scratch on the lens."
3.0,"The material was beautiful, but I could not wear it due to the super tight waist band. I'm 5'4, 119 lbs and even the large was too tight for me."
3.0,"it broke in just a few days of use , but the idea was great"
3.0,"This looks good, but it is a very thin stretchy material. I was expecting a thicker material. Very easy to see underwear or any other lines beneath the skirt."
3.0,Only a thin person can wear this shirt!  Not flattering for plus size ladies.
3.0,"The photo is a bit misleading, this is for the red skirt portion only and as described, this is for TALL people only. It's too long for me to wear at all. Basic cotton, good drape but only for TALL people!"
3.0,These are not as described. They are &#34;soft&#34; . I will not buy again.
3.0,"The bottom piece of this suit was cut much larger than the top.  I wear a 14/16 on the bottom and a 10/12 on top  but found that the bottom of the swimsuit was roomy, while the top was too snug."
3.0,It wasn't the color I expect it was a little teal. Not a lot of  definition in the waist area. Material was great.
3.0,These are nice leggings but they slide down off my torso every time I sit down or bend over.
3.0,Very small for children.
3.0,Didn't fit well as a girl with small chest.
3.0,"the jacket is great and super soft and warm, however, the arms are an inch/ two inches too short for me. super disappointed."
3.0,"These work well, and I would recommend them. However, I do not like the hook-and-loop style fastening on these. After a full day of wear they hook-and-loop almost always comes off center or comes undone, regardless of how tight or loose fitting I make the band around my leg. A snap or some other kind of fastener would totally resolve the issue"
3.0,This is not a 16G. It is probably a 14G. So it was too large for what I needed.
3.0,They did the job for the money they cost
3.0,"The bifocal part works great, but the distant part is blurred. I have to take them off to see distance clearly which defeats the whole purpose of bifocals. They are relatively sturdy, but flimsier than other low priced reading glasses I have purchased. Not sure what the function of the magnet in the middle at the bridge of the nose. I don't like the thought of a magnet sitting between my eye."
3.0,Torso was too short. Probably best if you are under 5 ft 6in.
3.0,Son HATED this lol. But product seemed great.
3.0,"I ordered 5 of these shirts in 6xl based on the reviews and some varied in fit. They did all fit a bit bigger on me than I expected after reading the reviews of how small they were. I wasn't a fan of the big boxy fit on me but when I realized it had the straps to button them up on the sides it looked much cuter! Unfortunately only 3 out of the 5 shirts I ordered came with had the button holes sewn up but I'm just going to fix them myself. Worth the price for $11. They do feel like good material and aren't thin and flimsy like most women's flannel shirts. The buttons on the pockets on the chest are just sewn on the top flaps, so just for show."
3.0,cheap-looking but good customer service
3.0,"Very small I’m normally a L/XL with  the extra slouchy look with plenty of room. An XL fit like a tight medium.  The treading and material of the fabric looks as if it would be coming apart after a couple washes. I wanted to love this I found it on shein or one of those clothing  subscription boxes, and found the exact match on Amazon. This definitely fell flat for me."
3.0,The holes to thread the necklace are so small - that the only necklace you can use with these pendants - is the necklace that came with the pendants.  Rather small.  I do not recommend it.
3.0,"My wife needed new workout leggings and has had issues with getting ones that weren't see through while lifting weights. Thought these were the ones, and after she put them on, you could immediately see right through the fabric. She did say the only good thing about them is that they are 'soft material'."
3.0,"I really like these dresses/kaftans but they were not flattering on me. I am taller with very large breasts, and the dress lay a little short on me and just made me look like a sack of potatoes or like I was wearing a burqua.<br /><br />The material is like a thicker t-shirt jersey. Not see through, decent quality.<br /><br />This would be much more flattering on a slimmer, shorter person (below 5'9""). It looks great on a lot of the women in these reviews and I was hoping for the same but it didn't work out."
3.0,"Looks nice, the color is attractive.  Good design with a reasonable number of pockets and top zipper goes both left and right.  Is the size I was looking for for overnight travel. But if this is to be useful for a number of years, then some of the stitching should be double stitched.  Several seams already look &#34;iffy&#34;."
3.0,My daughter enjoyed it until it got easily dented and couldn’t get it out.
3.0,Not great quality. Must be very close to garage door  before it will open.
3.0,This pin is not that large and doesn't stand out much. Very nondescript. I bought it because it was the only option I could find.
3.0,perfect size but it came with dirt embedded on the outside
3.0,"The outfit was very cute. Look as pictured. Shirt was a little tight. But overall, cute outfit."
3.0,Way too long!!! But they are cute
3.0,VERY VERY SMALL. I knew it wasnt big but picture is NOT accurate of how small it actually is
3.0,You can't put more than 1 or 2 keys on this little key ring.  Putting even those two keys on this keychain is quite the effort.  I had to use something durable like a letter opener to pry it open and add the keys.<br />Shows fingerprints and this immediately detracts from the appeal.<br />Other than that it is well made and should last a long time.
3.0,"Very long, see thru, could be worse"
3.0,"CHEAPLY MADE<br />SEAMS CAME OPEN AFTER 2 WASHES, DID NOT PUT IN DRYER."
3.0,"I gave 3-stars only because of the design, 5-stars for everything else.<br />The face shield looks better on the picture, but don't be surprised if your face shield does not look the same when you put it on."
3.0,Just like other thin wool gloves I've had. Work well as a liner.
3.0,This skirt would be great but the top of the waist has a small elastic band that is very tight.
3.0,"Not Very sturdy, kept coming undone."
3.0,Color was not white. Very small in side.<br />Not what I expected
3.0,It was too tight and Ill fitting
3.0,The dress has little shape to it and seems to run rather large. I  wear a size 4 and their small was easily what would be an 8.
3.0,Mens shirt is true to size. Womens runs small. Disappointed to say the least.
3.0,"Nice piece, however slightly flimsy."
3.0,I finally found a pair that fit but I wish it had a non-slip lip on the upper opening. Than I can give it 5 stars
3.0,"I love the ring it self. but it is cheap quality. it turned me green in a few days, it was to small but fit on a different finger.. I love the ring it self.. but not worth paying for it and the shipping.. the jewelry that I have gotten has been very bad quality. and I will never buy from this company again.."
3.0,"Cheesy fabric, should have just ordered direct from the site"
3.0,"Beautiful robes; I bought 6 violet & 1 white. I love them all & would have given a 5 star review, except 1 robe is a different color than the rest. 5 are dark purple, but 1 is fuchsia. Not sure what happened. It's too close to my wedding to return though."
3.0,My daughter loves the pattern
3.0,"Selected these to fit over my 6 year old son’s glasses.  The sunglasses did not fit over his 5” wide, 1  3/8” tall glasses (measured at the outside corner).<br /><br />Quality seems fine, they fit my 4 year old perfectly (a baby-faced kid with a big head, fatty cheeks, and no substantial nose bridge)"
3.0,The skirt fits nicely around my hips but is a little tight around my waist. It’s definitely more high waisted than I anticipated.
3.0,"I loved the look of this product, but the stones weren't adhered very sturdily. In addition, it came folded up in a small box, creating bends in the lanyard, which them shifted the stones out of place."
3.0,I love how soft it is but the ear holes dont really do too much.
3.0,It is big but the color is not quite as the picture shows
3.0,"This nightgown is made of a slinky, clingy, stretchy fabric that you might like in a top but not for sleep.  Not what I expected or wanted in a nightgown material so I returned it."
3.0,The bracelet is cute but it doesn't stay secure.  The first snap comes loose very easily.  There have been a few times that I nearly lost it if not for grace.  I bought it because someone stole my handcuff bracelet and I need another one for daily wear.  I do wear the hamsa bracelet daily but it is a constant worry over the snaps.
3.0,Black part was faded but the ring is chunky and solid
3.0,"I knew I had kind of a big head to begin with, but it fit on the smaller size. Will most likely return."
3.0,Ordered a larger size to fit better<br />Have not laundry yet
3.0,"Bought the XL, gave it to my daughter and it's right on her, she usually wears a medium."
3.0,Good suit for the price<br />A little on the small side in length
3.0,"According to the charts, I should order an XL.  I opted for a L, but the M would have been better.  I am 5'4 and it's about 2 or 3 inches too long.  The top feels like a bathing suit, while the navy is the perfect cotton material I had been looking for.  For me, this doesn't fit...."
3.0,Returning these shoes because they are too tight and the heel is too high for me. Don't get me wrong the shoe is BEAUTIFUL!!! I have reordered them from HuaMei. They give you the option of sending them your measurements and you can pick your heel height!! Littleboutique should do the same! At least the return won't cost much because you return them to a shipping company in the US. I will give another review when I receive them.
3.0,"The ears/headband is fine, the tail is very thin and short, not at all like a cat, unless maybe on a very small child.  I will use the ears and am making a tail."
3.0,"This is not a BAD dress. But the blue looks like be more flattering and better quality, based on the customer review pictures. The black is completely see through, I had to wear full body spanks as not to show everyone my entire body. Wish I wouldve bought the blue instead"
3.0,Love the material...so soft. But snug.
3.0,Chinese sizing it's still is slightly larger than expected.  It's really long tunic like length and see thru.  My plan is to wear a tank under with some skinny jeans and boots :) I like the colors.  Someone really tall would like this for sure.
3.0,They flap in the wind.
3.0,Straps not adjustable and was too small in bust I’m a 36DDD and it was loose in the straps which You cannot adjust
3.0,Is it really what it looks like in the picture??
3.0,"Material was great, sizing seemed over generous.<br />The skirt material is a lot stiffer than I'd like. Makes it a little less feminine not as flowy if you can get that."
3.0,okay but doesn't work for a men's chain
3.0,The charm was not as pictured. There was no black to enhance the scorpion. Was not pleased. Kept the charm as it was inexpensive. In the future will purchase Pandora directly from a store.
3.0,the color is not the same as shown
3.0,"I love this tank top, unfortunately, even going up a size it was way too small."
3.0,"These are nice and they do they job, but they are a bit flimsy. The first one broke after only about a month. Thankfully there were a couple of extras in the package and I swapped the broken one out."
3.0,"I won't expect I will like this tunic so much! And the color I have selected is great. I'm normally in L size and selected L, fit as expected. Wearing with tight jeans. Highly recommended. Planning to order one more of different color.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have ordered caramel color, and not happy with this one, the fabric is thinner and more blended/ mixed color, like heather color, will return. Also I'm changing the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars"
3.0,Didn't for right. Was a little oddly down.
3.0,"I think I only wore this jacket one time.  Unfortunately, I could barely move my arms.  Other than it being too small, it is still so cute and good quality."
3.0,"Cute color and decent quality, but you can see every crevice or roll. I am not a large girl, but I do have a butt and these made me feel a bit uncomfortable."
3.0,Runs small. Cute dress though
3.0,The top is red but the bottom fabric is not the same as the top or the colors are not accurate. Bottom of dress is not as pure as the top. Can see the thread in the Seams. Not made well
3.0,My daughter loves the pajamas. However I have had to make the button wholes smaller so the buttons would stay buttoned. I have also had fix seams that keep coming undone.
3.0,I've bought from this company for years.  They are the best quality for the cheapest price.  In my last batch i got one with this weird sticky rusty stuff on it that wouldn't come off. So i will still probably buy these... but they need to check on their quality control.
3.0,"I am 5'1 and 120 pounds; ordered a medium based on other reviews. I will be returning this for two reasons.<br />1) From trying on the small, it was already too big.<br />2) If fits as if you are wearing a blanket; not flattering."
3.0,"When I ordered this watch, it was shown with a green band. The watch that arrived had a red band? Also, there were no setting instructions included with the watch."
3.0,"I am 5'6 and weigh 145. I ordered a medium and it made me look like a potato. The shirt in the photo has a slim fit. That being said, the design/print was really high quality and the shirt was soft."
3.0,"Alright, didn’t cause any infection and looked like good nose piercings, I just didn’t expect it to be so hard to bend it took me forever"
3.0,The material is a little cheaper than I expected.  I was disappointed in it.
3.0,Didn't like the waistband print
3.0,"I really, really wanted to like these bras.  I ordered several.  And at first, I really loved them.  Then after moving around, bending, doing normal life things - the wires on the sides started curling in and digging in to my skin.  They would not stop curling in even after adjusting them and sitting still for a bit.  They are pretty and a reasonable price, but the wire stays on the side are painful and make these a no-go, unfortunately."
3.0,"I liked the costume but they sent me the wrong size. I asked for a xs, but I got a medium. I needed it for Halloween so, I didn't return it. I was nice though that they sent some white stockings with it. Also, undershirt must be worn under the dress because of there is little bit of an opening in between the corset part of the dress and you can see through it.. It's a hole."
3.0,a little tight for my husband's head but otherwise is working fine.
3.0,"I have pretty average sized hands/fingers and these only come to the first knuckle. Only will go all the way down if you have skiiiiiny fingers. Also if you have nickel allergy or sensitive skin, these will turn your fingers green/black in an instant.<br /><br />But, I only needed them for a Halloween costume and they worked well. Very cute, just small and cheap."
3.0,See the picture of the item(top). The underware I received. I expect the leg would be longer because my daughter wears other cut of underwear they running up. She has thick thighs. My order was miss lead by the pictures they posted.
3.0,Wayyy to big looks like it’s 2T on my 15 month old I’m extremely disappointed
3.0,The waist band on these shorts are extremely scratchy. Fit is smaller then expected
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, when hanging in a hanger. Once you put it on, it's still nice but the ""leotard"" part was quite a challenge. When you sit down, the chest area opens up. I ordered this twice, 2 different sizes and neither worked for me so I gave up and returned them."
3.0,I didn't like how edges weren't finished. To big
3.0,"nice looking, thank you"
3.0,Disrespect is cute but it isn’t a good look for my body type. I haven’t worn it yet.
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 200 lbs and usually wear XL. I ordered XXL so it would hang off me like the picture, but it doesn't. The material is very light weight, so it doesn't hang well. Looks nothing like the picture, the neck is not wide enough and the rest is too big."
3.0,"Ordered the blue in a size small. The color is beautiful and the quality is decent. However  the size small runs more like a medium.  I'm not a big girl 5'3"", 120lbs. This shirt was way too loose all er including the arms. I really wish, that clothing companies and vendors especially here on Amazon,  would provide and sell accurate sizes.  I understand this is a tunic top, and it is meant to fit loose, but this was beyond. That is my honest opinion. I really wanted it to work, but it didn't."
3.0,"I had to return this hat. IT was much heavier than I was expecting. Also, too big. And I ordered a Small. I did get the credit for the price of the hat, quite promptly after shipping it back. That was good. LRC"
3.0,The material was good quality and thick. The color was beautiful. The only thing I did not like is it did not flatter the body if you are curvy. Maybe it would work well with more narrow shapes. I bought the dress in size XL.
3.0,smaller than said.  but looks good.
3.0,I love these. My daughters use them all the time... but...buy directly from lands end website. They cost  $13. Who sets these prices?
3.0,Two pairs of the six were defective.  One had holes and the other had black dots that did not wash out.  Gold Toe used to be such good quality; what happened?
3.0,I really like the look but it's a bit heavy.  I did use an extender so it wasn't a choker.
3.0,"These pants are very cute if you have long legs. I’m 5ft 2 inches and 135lbs, curves hips and stocky legs. These made me look wider and shorter."
3.0,I sent a pair back because they didn't fit right. I reordered and still they don't fit good. Made cheap won't order anymore.
3.0,"I ordered my daughter a size up and it was still very snug. There is good stretch to it but she doesn't like anything that clingy. I bought women's medium, she usually wears a small. She's 5""3', 120, very athletic build, 34c"
3.0,These are really pretty and they go with any outfit the problem is they are even super loose or to tight. Have not found and in between and it hurts more than I like to admit lol but if you can get around that you’ll be okay
3.0,The material was was too thick for me! I love the print and style a lot however i couldn't imagine sleeping or wearing this without feeling overwhelmed with the thickness of the material.  I returned this item.
3.0,"This tank has thick ribbed material. It’s designed to be form fitting. I ordered a LARGE….I’m 5’3 and 135lbs. Form fitting would have been fine but I looked (and felt) more like a stuffed sausage. Just not my kind of comfort. Maybe this tank under a sweater or button down would work, but not by itself for me anyway."
3.0,The bag was pretty and functional. Not for heavy use. Only lasted a few months as my daughter does activities everyday.
3.0,Average quality. Good but not great.
3.0,These socks are very cute. They are soft and the toe seam sits above your toes so it's not uncomfortable.  My daughter is almost 14 and has a size 8 shoe.  These fit very comfortably on her without stretching much at all.  My only complaint is one pair already has a small hole in the toe.  So I'm guessing these aren't very durable. So I guess kind of pricey to only get 3 weeks wear before holes start showing.
3.0,They look very nice and the quality is fine too. The reason I only gave them 3 stars is because one fit me well. But the other is too tide. I wish both were of the same size...
3.0,"Eh.... it has the length and flowiness, but my lower half looks so grandma-ish. Very unflattering for my body shape (36, 26, 40 - 145lbs, 5’8). Nice material for the price, but I wish it didn’t have a think black elastic band at the top...."
3.0,"They're comfy, but I end up having to constantly tug them back up. Also had a strong chemical smell to them that took many washes to nix. The fleece inside us super soft- like the inside of a new sweatshirt. The material outside is prone to pulling."
3.0,"Good quality and features.  Wish they were a little more subtle, flashier than I expected."
3.0,Color is on the pink side
3.0,"I would have loved it if it was wine red as stated, but it is a very bright red."
3.0,"Absolutely loved the design, but the shaping and size of the cuff was a bit off.<br /><br />In regards to the shape, the edges are smooth but nearing the center of the cuff, or rather the area that gets bent when placing the cuff, it gets thinner so I'm afraid that it might break in half at any moment. It could have been a fluke with just my cuff, but it's a bit bothersome since I would love to wear it all the time.<br /><br />The size of the product is also a bit weird. It fits along my upper helix and I think it looks better worn there, but it is a bit loose and hurts to tighten it too much. The cuff also doesn't really fit lower around my ear closer to my lobe (but this could be because my ears are big..).<br /><br />Overall, I like the cuff enough, I would have bought another one for my sister if it didn't seem like it was going to snap in half."
3.0,My husband really likes the material but we had to return once because they were too small. And the new size (x-large) still fits a little small. My husband's waist is a 36.
3.0,They are way to big they look like a tennis shoe but not the comfort of a tennis shoe
3.0,Didn’t like colors
3.0,Unsure if I will keep or return.  Fabric is thin.  I haven’t worn it yet - still trying to decide.
3.0,Great value but clasp a pain to close
3.0,My racket did not fit in the racket holder.
3.0,Came with A LOT of the links stuck together I had to fuss with it for over a half a hour for it to lay or look right. Over all you get what you pay for anf its good for the price..
3.0,Nice for the low price.
3.0,I am usually a medium/large (leaning more toward a large) and the small in this dress was still too big for me. I have a large chest and the small still fit but the rest of the dress was so much material that I looked three times as wide as I usually do. The material was very comfortable and soft though.
3.0,Very pretty but order at least 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,Runs small. I'm 36 bust 26 waist 36 hips and I bought a small (I weigh 120 and am 5'5&#34; and always wear a small) and it is pretty tight! After the first wash it didn't shrink too much but the lettering all cracked. It's a great shirt and soft material. I wish I had ordered a medium... And I'm kinda bummed about the screen print all cracking (photo attached). So order a size up unless you like things really tight!
3.0,The band is gorgeous.  I thought I checked that it fit a galaxy 4 watch but o suppose I did not. However...the band did fit. The circular part did not. Also. It is very big. My husband had to take a lot off the band to fit wrist. Also in his words. The tool that is provided to take pieces off the band is cheaply made. It bended after one use.
3.0,Did not realize the type of closure. Was not the traditional.
3.0,It's too long.  Love everything else - so soft.  But I'll have to get it taken up which will add $10 to the total price - that's too much for me to pay for a nightgown.
3.0,Gorgeous skirt... great for twirling.  Removed 2 stars due to sizing.  I ordered an XL and it fit more like a small or medium.  Very disappointed that I'll have to return.
3.0,"Loved the color and the intricate pattern. Smelled plastick-y when it first came through, but then the odor went off.<br />Not a very flattering fit, if you are curvy/ top-heavy. But can be worked around with a tank top/ cami underneath it."
3.0,I'm 5 ft 3 in . Ankle measure 8 in. Calf measures 13 in. These socks are difficult to get on. They are too tight around the top of the calf and wrinkle at the ankles leaving indentations both places.  Too long for a woman my height/weight.
3.0,"It’s a beautiful swimsuit and wanted to like it, but couldn’t wear as it runs small. It’s going back."
3.0,"not the same size, other than that is very good"
3.0,"I ordered a large they’re very comfortable. I mainly use them in the gym, I don’t wear these for cardio because they tend to move around and ride up. I love them for the gym has pockets"
3.0,ok dont love it
3.0,Nice hat but it doesn't have much 'give'.  Needs to be stretched out a little for us big-head ladies.
3.0,"Much much smaller than it seems in the picture. It looks smaller, looking straight on, than a Tic Tac. The color is nice."
3.0,It’s a cute dress but the tutu part started to com apart. Cute for a one time use. My daughter only used it for her birthday party.
3.0,These worked perfectly and looked cute the first time my daughter wore them. After hand washing and hang drying they just don't stay up as well and slide into her boots.
3.0,It's made from a nice heavy material. Unfortunately  dispite the size chart it was too small. Would recomend to defiantly order a size up.
3.0,"Love this suit, the top fits great but the bottoms are a little too small. I wear a large in most swimming suits and ordered a large."
3.0,Product good quality but not good fit for me
3.0,Got for my granddaughter...very disappointed.  Looked much better in photo.
3.0,Beautiful watch a little to thick for me.
3.0,Returned due to being too small. Quality was nice!
3.0,Definitely make you sweet but it’s huge. Size down. I ordered a small and it’s baggy on me so I had to put a waist belt around it . It fit like a undershirt
3.0,"Shirt is ok, but it does not have any of the purple variations (like the picture), so the textures are not as clean."
3.0,Not sure how I like the quality for the price
3.0,Not as flattering on! I’m 5’2 so I recommend y’all people to this dress!
3.0,I was so excited when I saw my roommate with these & thought they were the cutest. They are cute but after wearing them three times (light use) the bottom of the shoe began to fray. I planned on wearing them all the time because the color goes with anything BUT now that I realize they are so 'fragile' I will wear them sparingly. I got the 'nude' shoe but it is closer to pink then anything. I wear a size 10 and the shoe is a bit big. It forms a sort of line where the big toe is from buckling. My roomie wears a 9 and my big toe protrudes out of the front. So I really needed a 9 1/2 but they don't have that size. Poor me. Maybe my roommate feels differently but I will not be ordering another pair of these.
3.0,"Color is a soft mint green, so that was good.  But, it is boxy and 'itchy'.  In the fall I threw it on to run errands, but would not wear it otherwise.  Sorry.  I bought a medium; I am 5'5"", 130 pounds; a small would probably have fit, but it is boxy."
3.0,Size up runs small. The dress quality is great tho.
3.0,Wore it one time and the bottom belly chain broke!  Very disappointed. I'll try to give it a fix :(
3.0,it was kind of large in places and fit in others. it worked for what i needed but disapointed in quality.
3.0,They do not look anything like the pictures.
3.0,"I had highly anticipated getting this dress because all the reviews were so great and it looked so beautiful online. Unfortunately it was entirely too big and looked like a sack on me. I am 5’5 112 pounds and always wear a small, but this just did not fit, sadly :(<br />But the dress itself was so beautiful and well-made!"
3.0,"they feel cheap but for the price they are a very good deal. I would recommend to someone else. The hinges aren't very good and often stick, the lenses are overall good."
3.0,i don’t like the itchy waistband Stichting. Otherwise this dress is perfect. There this thing that is super annoying: that use a fish line texture threading to sow in the tag. Super hard to get off and annoying.
3.0,The family tree was nice but the chain had no clasps.
3.0,Great quality but runs very small! Sad we won't get as much use out of it as I hoped but it's nice!
3.0,"I ordered and quickly received the Happy Sailed Women Little Mermaid Swimwear Plus Size Swimsuits, XXX-Large Black.  This Happy Sailed women Little Mermaid Swimwear was mail in plastic shipping bag and delivered to my front door.  The came in a clear plastic bag with nothing else in the bag.  I must say I was a little disappointed that it took almost four (4) weeks to get this swimsuit.  I got this for my wife.  She likes the swimsuit and it fits everywhere but the top of the suit.  She will probably need to wear a top on since it does not fit properly.  I have never bought a swimsuit on the internet before and probably won't again.  It is too difficult to know how this would fit my wife unless she tries it on. The swimsuit looks very nice, but since it is a large swimsuit I guess it is assumed all are large breasted as well.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

3.0,Very small for size large
3.0,"I ordered this watch band in Brown in January, worked great and super comfortable, so I ordered it in Black but the pin on the black one I just got is super weak and pops off of my watch constantly. I have a Garmin venue sport watch, they're not cheap, so I'm too afraid to use this watch band and take the chance of my watch face falling off and breaking."
3.0,"These pants are not very stretchy, they are more stiff. They are also not very breathable. I mostly wear them in the winter since they feel too heavy for summer."
3.0,I was looking for a pretty ring in gold tones and gemstones. Stumbled upon this gal.<br />For the price it’s pretty and comfortable.
3.0,"Color is not as deep of a burgundy as picture shows. Bottoms fit perfectly but the top does not offer any support, the fit could be better but I can make it work. I like the suit overall."
3.0,"It didn't have any credit / debit card slots.  currency and coin placement was kind of sloppy.  also it was a brighter color than expected (more fuchsia than rose).  the idea was great, but it wasn't for me."
3.0,"Hat is comfortable, fits fine, but the  signage on the hat itself is big enough that, ""I DON'T  KNOW""  at the top of it isn't  as visible tovread as it is partly on the upper part of the crown of the hat, if the signage was a tad smaller is would be much easier  to read the complete statement, same with the other hat , ""IT'S  FINE<br />  I'M FINE""<br />Looking at it on your head, it is harder to read, the top  lines on upper crown of both hats. A little smaller logo/ signage, the complete wording would be on the complete front of the crown, visible to all of it ! No regrets but it cold be better and 5 star !"
3.0,"This product felt of good quality, but I was unable to use it because it fit to small. I reviewed the size chart before ordering and it seemed like it should fit but it didn't."
3.0,Like the glasses but gave 3 stars because I had to buy new ones because the one I had broke in the middle !
3.0,Do not like having to tie it onto the hat Should’ve had a zipper or some kind away that she could put it around the head without having to tie it
3.0,Material very thin...not expensive looking.
3.0,"It's a nice pattern, the fabric is kind of cheap though."
3.0,the BF heart were really nice  but on one of them miss a diamond  and i was really upset..
3.0,"These are good quality and soft, but the sleeves are too short (on both sizes that we tried)."
3.0,"These tights fit me fine. I am 4'10&#34; and 92 pounds. They seem to be of fine quality however they are not fleece. They are nothing more than regular tights. They are solid and not see through. I do not see these as being warm. They are no different than any pair of regular tights you could purchase anywhere. These can not be worn with a long sweater or tunic or a short dress, they are much too thin."
3.0,Overall I liked the dress a lot but it just cost me $12 more to have it have a seamstress make it fit me in length.
3.0,"I was looking forward to using these as part of my Grandson's Easter Basket, the color on the actual face coverings is NOTHING close or as vibrant as shown.  Looks like I might have gotten the last set made with the color printer used to make them when it ran out of color. Disappointed, I've still not decided if I want to go through the trouble of returning them."
3.0,Coolest shades I've owned however it broke way too easily and I wasn't doing anything for it to break. Didn't even last me a month.
3.0,"Dress is very tight in the bust area.. I am not huge, I am big busted... can't even close the buttons.<br />Have to return it as I ordered XL, I am 5'9&#34; and size 12-14"
3.0,Don’t like the magnet
3.0,"Chain broke during regular wear, not at the clasp either - one of the boxes separated.  Disappointing as the pendant is very nice looking.<br /><br />Currently shopping around for a replacement chain, don't want to order another 18&#34; chain from same seller since it would probably suffer same fate."
3.0,Does what a hat should. Kids are disappointed the side snaps don't work on 4 of the 5 hats we got.
3.0,"Necklace very nice, but the clasp is so small it's hard to put on or take off. I can't put it on alone and my husband has trouble with it also."
3.0,"It works as a coverup, but I wanted it more as a dress but I don't dare ware it as an every day dress unless you are real skinny and very short"
3.0,The belts I ordered were way to big.
3.0,Toe box area was too large. Pretty design and lovely leather. She was tripping over the extra in the front. Not enough area in the back to strap the heel.
3.0,I think it is just me and the way I like thing to fit.
3.0,"Very large, falls off my wrist. Otherwise very cool."
3.0,"I had some &#34;GoHike&#34; gloves similar to these, that were lost... So I decided to replace them.  These were as close as I could come to the same thing, as the GoHike version is no longer on Amazon.  The fake windstopper fabric is much thinner on these... and while that makes the gloves stretchier, and more snug... It makes them much less protective as well.  These gloves are comfy and form-fitting, but not good for temps below 40 or so... and not for long-term exposure.  They're worth about what they cost."
3.0,Too short. I am 5’6” and it was by my ankles. Not cute. Love the material and I thought it will be the same length as the long sleeve I already own. But this was too short.
3.0,"The strings are tooo tight so if you are walking - easy to get blisters. However, if it fits (for those with narrow feet), I think it is a great product."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in these pajamas- I have other Carole Hochman pajamas that I like better- these seem to run a size smaller, and the fabric is thinner and not as buttery soft as my others.  I suppose you get what you pay for- this set costs about half what I payed for the other 3 piece sets.  I will keep these and wear them, but they just aren’t as luxe as my others"
3.0,Matches the picture very well. Great aesthetic but fail to block out the sun and fall apart very easily. These are very high mantience or “Good For One Use” type glasses.
3.0,"It is so very attractive on a sweater or cape; however, one of the ends slips off because the ""teeth"" do not hold."
3.0,"They are cute and fit well, but the inside is a slick material so they slide down constantly."
3.0,"The shirt was very pretty but I wish I had ordered a larger size, its worth to buy it but I would order two sizes up otherwise its a good buy!!!"
3.0,"5 stars for customer service. Great job on trying to may this work for my wife but it just didn't work out.<br />1 star for buoyancy.  Tested them at home and it barely floated in the pool but it did rise to the top slowly.  Went on vacation in Mexico and tested in the ocean and pool and they just sunk.  Would not even try to float.  With waves churning,  it would be hard or impossible to find my $260 Maui Jim sunglasses if they were to fall off.<br />4 stars for non- buoyancy functionally.  The strap  holds the glasses pretty securely on your head.  I went jet skiing and needed something I could trust to float if they fell off so could really use this for that."
3.0,I didn’t love the dress length and the color is way too pepto pink for me.
3.0,Love the feel of the material. I am a size 11 and it keeps coming off in the shoe :-(
3.0,No way to hold it. The neck feels really tight.
3.0,"We received these shoes as a gift off a wish list for baby's first birthday - I loved the design of being able to zip around the foot!  Very clever and effective.  The leather is very smooth and nice, and it seems comfortable and minimal under the sole, which is advised for babies learning to walk.  The fit was just fine- 12-18 mo size fit perfect at 12 mo.<br />After 1 month of wearing perhaps 2 times a week (so max, 8 wears), the zipper began to break and the leather was scuffed. The scuffing I expected.  If you think about how a baby crawls and walks, when crawling, their toes scrape the ground, and when walking, the toe is what runs into things or catches/trips.  So the zipper began to pull out of the fabric at the frets across the front of the shoe.  We were still able to use them with a small hole developing for another month, but the damage continued to grow, and they are not unusable, at 2 months of use.<br /><br />I would not buy these again, as much as I like their look and style and design for my child's foot (and ease of putting on!).  It is not worth the price for the amount of use they provided."
3.0,They look really good but they are very fragile especially at the stems.
3.0,I bought this from the same seller. I love the black and white one. However the material is different on this one. Not as thick and larger. It’s too loose for my face. Not sure why the size is different. I do love the design and color. It’s great for this holiday season.
3.0,"I liked them okay.  Each earring had one stone missing. They probably would have replaced them, but I didn't have time before the event to try to exchange them."
3.0,Was such a tight fit around the neck and bottom trim. And also the jacket it not meant to keep you warm if it's less than 65 degrees outside. It's very thin.
3.0,"I love this shirt, I wear it often. The only sad thing is that is came with a small hole ripped in the sleeve."
3.0,"This product is great but I prefer the &#34;Mousand&#34; brand. I think they are from the same people but the Mousand is a bit more updated... I got a size smaller and it reallly made a difference, the one in &#34;my size&#34; was as flattering, and didn't stick in all the right places!"
3.0,It was ok...
3.0,"Fine, but after a while it started almost falling apart... . Not durable enough. Buy just for a cheap price."
3.0,Great alternative to your favorite jeans!
3.0,The shirt smelled of being in storage for a long time.  It has a slim fit and is very long.  Unfortunately I'm average height and weight.
3.0,Cute keychain! Fast delivery!
3.0,"The quality of the watch band is sub par, but for the price it is understandable, the leather feels extremely plastic like. The tool it came with was bent when i received it but still did its purpose. The bar pins were thinner than expected but still seem strong. I can say honestly i am pleased with the purchase at the price, because of my need of a new watch band in short notice. But if you are in need of a quality geniune leather watch band i would not recommend this because of how buckle and all components are very quality. I will be replacing it at a later date with a nato band from Crownandbuckle.com."
3.0,The glue came off. But is still nice overall
3.0,"The zipper  comes off in just 2 days of use, my son is disappointed cuz he likes the hoody a lot but the zipper  comes off and now I have to return the item"
3.0,Works great for my job that doesnt allow my nose piercing. The little ball on the bottom is a bit rough at first needs to soak in some hit water before using to soften them up a little but other than that they are great and stay put
3.0,"Great looking glasses, frames scratch easily."
3.0,I love this top!!!  The bottoms are way to small and thin but I just found others that matched. The price is definitely worth it to get the top!
3.0,The zipper failed after a few months.
3.0,They do stop the glare but don't fit very well at all.
3.0,I bought these pants to go with my breast cancer awareness tie dyed t-shirt. The t-shirt is a soft natural cotton fabric. i was hoping the pants would come in the same material as the shirt. But it didn’t. The pants are a  shiny cheap polyester blend. They don’t match the t-shirt for this reason. I wear them around the house. But I probably would never wear them out of the house.
3.0,It is what it is for the price.
3.0,Fits snug and sexy. Wore it to my sisters wedding.  Would have wanted to wear it longer but the zipper broke the first time. The zipper is hard to pull up and down and in the effort to get our it broke.  Getting a tailor to fix it will cost more than the dress. But cheap enough that I did not mind too much.
3.0,"This wallet is a RFID blocking wallet which is supposed to block unwanted identity theft of credit card information, I haven't noticed any illegal activity on any of my accounts so I guess it's working. The wallet has a leather feel  with 17 inner pockets, 2 main, 2 side, 1 change holder, 12 credit card holders. The zipper is gold and the label outside of the wallet is gold, It's a very attractive looking wallet, the only issue I have with this wallet is that the zipper has started getting stuck and the zipper teeth are starting to move making it really hard to zip close and open."
3.0,Ordered paisley and received SOLID yellow and not what was pictured
3.0,"My Sister bought this for me and I absolutely Loved it!!!!! The size was Okay but the Glow at Night was Brilliant! On the Downside, I read some other reviews and some said theirs didn't even glow! Before you ship it please make sure that it glows, just a test, not resizing the chain or anything too complicated. The iPhone Flashlights made the glow last for a Max of 2.5 hours and a Minimum of 45 minuets at least! After about 12 or less times of wearing it its Tarnished easily, very pinkish color and didn't look good at all. I still have the Necklace of course since it was a gift but it doesn't look good at all when its not a silver color. I hope this helped anyone."
3.0,the collar is nothing like it is in the picture. it just a plain round collar. sad this is why I fell in love with this dress. also the zip goes right to the end there is no area with a small slit at the front. Material and colour satisfactory. But all the things that pulled me to this dress are missing.
3.0,it was cool but unfortunately somewhat small so I had 2 return it
3.0,its alright fit good and look good..
3.0,"The gauge is slimmer than standard, and the ball on the end is pretty much non-existant. I'm not sure how this post is supposed to stay in... But the product itself was as described so I'd say average."
3.0,Cant use them as they were too small...ordered the large instead
3.0,Love the logo but the hat looked goofy.
3.0,The fabric is bunchy on the sides and the sleeves are a bit tight on the shoulders. I am 5'6&#34; 160 and have a 36DD bust and I purchased a large.  The top looks great but my shoulders are a uncomfortable and I should have almost ordered a size up to count for my chest.
3.0,It is nice but lasts for one or two years max then the paint wear out. Lets say it is ok. Thank you.
3.0,"Does not look like the picture, it has 3colors and I thought it was black and green.  The jacket itself was nice just not what I thought it was going to be. I returned it because it wasn't the colors I was after."
3.0,"The sweater was shorter than expected - it’s advertised as being closer to mid-thigh but only came a couple inches below my hip. I’m on the taller side (5’11”), with broader shoulders and an XL was snug.<br /><br />Additionally, the coloring was way off! What I ordered was khaki (looks rather beige in the photos, just what I had in mind), but arrived in a kind of golden-mustard yellow. Very unappealing.<br /><br />Needless to say, I’ll be sending this back."
3.0,"Just got it, but there are obvious stains on some of charms and they can't be removed."
3.0,I didn’t  like how it looked on me. Wish I did b/c it looked amazing online and on other people. Super comfy and nice material though. TTS
3.0,"I was looking for a small bag that I can use on my day trips to Disneyland. I found this bag bulky, and hard to get into certain pockets.<br />I have another Berchirly bag that I absolutely love, but I wanted another bag just slightly bigger and unfortunately this new one wasn’t it. I should have done more research on the item before I purchased it."
3.0,The arms on the glasses barely touch your ears. It's like they are made for a small kid.
3.0,Product was to big. It felt comfy but was very loose. I exchanged it for a smaller size. I’m 145 lbs 5’2 got a large and was way to big.
3.0,Too large.  Wish there were sizes
3.0,I like the frames and lenses. They are good sunglasses. I was disappointed that the bifocal is on the outside of the lens so it is more noticeable and the bifocal is so low it makes it hard for me to use it.
3.0,Great to see through for a car bag but plastic is unwieldy
3.0,"It is too form fitting to wear in a professional environment. It doesn't appear that was in the photo. However, it is an adorable dress. I will keep it even though I will probably never wear it. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't hug under my butt. the fit is something you would wear to the club but the print looks like something you could wear out during the day or to the office."
3.0,"its wonderfully warm and snuggly.  but the pockets are of the same fluffy material, causing them to stick out about 3 inches on each side.  they look ridiculous. I will change them out."
3.0,I’m a medium but got a larger size. It was still too small. Shame because this dress is hot!  Love the color and texture
3.0,"Leggings are cute but they are definitely OSFA.  Purchased a large and was shocked to see how small they looked when I took them out of the package.  Really disappointing since they are a Christmas gift for someone- have no idea whether they will fit her or not.  There is NO size tag in the leggings themselves but invoice says ""large.""  I looked up the company name on the tag- Piggies Choice- and their website does indicate that the leggings are one size- why can't Amazon list them as such?!  The upside is that Piggies Choice seems to be a brand that helps support the Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue, so I am glad about that."
3.0,"Marketed as a plus size item that can fit larger legs, but seems petite. Quality is low. Sock isn’t tailored for feet sewn with a heel, they’re just frilly tubes. Lose shape during wear, fall down socks are the worst :("
3.0,"This shoe is really cute and the wedge is the perfect height, but they run small. I have a true wide foot and they do not run true to width. I had plans to wear them a lot with jeans and capris, but no can do. After an hour I'm ready to take them off. Would be great for med or narrow  feet."
3.0,"Beautiful color. Kind of thin, but still a good dress."
3.0,This was a give for my 5yr. old  great-granddaughter and I have had no feedback from her mother. I just got to give them to her on Easter
3.0,The box the box was broken.  The hinges was fell off when I opened it.  The watch it's self was ok thank god. The links are a little cheap but the face isn't bad.  I was surprised it was a heavy watch.  The face is nice and easy to read.  This is not a $60k Rolex Daytona but a much much cheaper replica. It's not worth more than $25 even though I paid $50. There isn't watches with the light blue and brown bezel so I thought that was unique. Invicta makes like the 9211 makes good quality replicas Daytona with various colors to choose from but not in light blue and brown dial.  I took a chance on this and somewhat satisfied.<br /> I will probably stay away from So Co watches moving forward.  I don't think this will be an everyday watch just from the build.  Overall it looks good on wrist from a distance. Should match with many outfits that I have.
3.0,Cute item and good quality but just too small for me. I cannot imagine how i could put a lot of stuff in it like most other reviewers did on their reviews.
3.0,My husbands head isn't fat enough. They fall off when he looks down. Also the sides are straight and don't bend around his ears. Ok for just reading the paper.
3.0,The liners keep fall out. One was lost at camp but luckily we found it the next day. I like the sock feel with good soles. My granddaughter can go from boats to beach to swimming and never need to take them off. They also protect her feet from burns.
3.0,"These glasses are much larger than expected. I wanted something for my Sophia Petrillo costume and although I needed big I didn't want this big. They took up I'd say at least half of my face and even stick out a bit on the sides. I wouldn't have purchased these had there been a picture to display the size of the glasses on someones face.<br />Also, being that I have no real knowledge of reading glasses and am just familiar with daily glasses.<br />These are indeed reading glasses and are either blurry or hard to focus depending on the person. Not an issue per say as they do note that they're reading glasses but for those of you in the same boat as I was keep that in mind when considering a purchase."
3.0,beautiful patch i put them on my ksubi jeans and received many compliments.
3.0,Love the color. Runs a little bigger than expected.
3.0,Super cute but very itchy.
3.0,this isn’t a flannel material at all but it’s still a decent shirt. the brown shirt was also a little different than in the photo.
3.0,It’s really short for my torso.
3.0,Color is maroon not red!
3.0,Sizes are much smaller
3.0,Was a little disappointed only I  the shape the frame isn't as high as they seem in the photo so if you were looking for the trendy look you are getting something totally diffenrent
3.0,Colors not as vivid as expected...
3.0,These are suuuuuuuuper cute!! The only issue is that it only comes in one size and in a VERY small size. To give you a perspective I am 5'7 and I weight 125 pounds so I am a pretty skinny gal. It gives you the worse wedgy every but it's still cute to look at.
3.0,The material used in making these glasses is not good. It seems to be of cheap quality. I would suggest they are more apt for reading rather than normal glasses as the lens size is also small.
3.0,"Bought these to keep my shirt tucked in while at work. Unfortunately they are too long even when shortened all the way.  Maybe I'm just short.  Anyways, if you are 5'8&#34; or under I would not recommend.  Otherwise they appear to be what is advertised."
3.0,Made widely
3.0,Ordered a 9 and it for like a 7<br />Photos on line  are much cuter than what I was sent :/
3.0,I think my expectations were pretty high but it is relatively heavy and bulky for travel. I'm using it at home for art supplies but have gone back to pencil bags for cords when I travel. Kinda disappointed.
3.0,I thought it was cute. Worth the buy.
3.0,Difficult to take on and off. Have medium wrist size. Like to switch arms at night. It's a pull and tug struggle to get on and off.
3.0,I'm OK with that
3.0,"Almost as if the Casio gods were watching over me, I started having issues with this watch after I submitted my initial review a couple weeks ago. The watch seems to ""die"" often, with the screen going blank and the watch resetting itself several minutes later (losing the time I had set on it). The bottom-right button almost never registers when I press it, making it borderline impossible to change the settings (time, alarm, stopwatch, 12/24h, etc.).<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for, and because of that, I'm not really upset by it -- the watch is really cheap after all. Just wish it would've lasted longer because I don't want to go through the effort of buying a new watch once a year."
3.0,Had expected to be able to wear a back back underneath but that is not possible....
3.0,Looses grip pretty easily
3.0,"Great, but very sintetic"
3.0,"Not a warm deal, but ok for summer.  thin and hope she does not rip them easy, time will tell"
3.0,Don't know yet as she hasn't grown into them yet. However they do look true to size.
3.0,"Overall these are alright leggings. I'm not upset that I bought them but have a few gripes.<br /><br />FIT: The legs are full-length, and on me (5'6"") the medium is a little bit long. Not terribly so, but if I wear tennis shoes instead of converse / vans the hem will bunch on the top of the shoes. The waist is high and not too tight, I can wear a crop top and still feel pretty covered. After a few washes the waist does stretch a little bit.<br /><br />MATERIAL AND COLOR: Very thick material, which hides lines pretty well. The heathery color and extra patterning in the material also help smooth out the look. Due to being a tad tall for me (see above) the little gray under-butt details sit lower than I'd like but are still cute. The ombre color is as pictured. My biggest gripe is that the seam on the inside of the legs is very pronounced and visible in dark thread.<br /><br />OVERALL - If you like longer leggings, a high waist, and thick material, this is for you. If you like seamless, cropped legs, or don't like butt-defining detail, this is not for you."
3.0,"My son really loves this set and for the price I'm pretty happy. As for the quality, there are some things to be desired. The terry cloth is thick but the stitching is poor so my sons came unraveled in the first few hours but I was able to salvage them with some hand stitching. I am not; however, able to get them embroidered as I was hoping."
3.0,"I got this apron while it was on sale a while ago. It's comfortable but if you're busty and tall, this might not fit right. I'm a women's size 20 and this wrapped around me well enough to protect me from splatters and stains on my clothes. The apron sits a bit too far up my chest than I like but what can you do since it's not adjustable? It wrinkles quite a lot after washing and oil stains do show up if you don't treat them before the wash. I ended up giving this to my mom who is a lot shorter and smaller than I am."
3.0,Based on the reviews I had to order a small and a medium both because I did not know which one would work. The small was way too tight around the hips in the medium fits around the hips but it seems much shorter in length than the small. I had ordered the coffee colored one in large before ordering knees and that one fit like a XXL. So I feel like the variance and sizes is way off from each other and the sizes they are supposed to be. I returned the coffee colored one and the small one of these but I am still considering whether or not to return the medium. I’m very self-conscious about my bottom area and my hopes were to cover it up completely which the medium does not do.
3.0,"I really like this dress. However, it isn’t silk like the photo kind of shows. It’s a cotton material. Still nice though. It’s also orange rather than coral, but still nice. Warning: it is extremely short and will be blown up easily. I wore this to an outside wedding and was miserable holding it down the entire time."
3.0,Really cute but one side is very loose and I fear they won't last long.
3.0,"Was way too small and wasn't as authentic looking as the League of their own uniforms, so I returned it."
3.0,"I wear a large or XL and ordered a XXL so I could wear heavier shirts underneath it. It runs so small that I am about 4 or 5 inches away from being able to zip it. Unfortunately, it will have to be returned. I would say that you need to go up 3 sizes if you have any curves at all."
3.0,My son absolutely loves these shoes. I wish the lighting was more reliable. So far so good right now though. His shoes were a hit at school.....
3.0,"I love the feel, size, and pattern of this case.  However, I can see where it won't last very long.  When it shuts, there's a bit of a ""wiggle"" , it doesn't snap closed real tight.  Hopefully that explains it well."
3.0,Lasted maybe 2 months before holes in the back pocket areas appeared and rendered then unwearable washed 4 times in that 4 month period. If your working in a warehouse environment and looking for something to last bit this may not be right or maybe I had some bad stitching...
3.0,gave it three stars because the chains turned brown with minimal wear.  but there was quite a variety of necklaces
3.0,Not jersey material more like polyester
3.0,My daughter is a 4t. I ordered a 5t so she could wear it all summer. It was way too small. I returned and got a 6th ( a little snug to put on the shoulders but otherwise fit perfect. I recommend ordering 1 -2 sizes big.
3.0,"Bought size 11 for may son. He is wearing 9.5W or 10M with some brands. The model appeared in my search as I searched for ""wide"" badminton shoes. The reviews for the previous model advised to buy larger so I decided to give it a try. The shoes appeared to be very narrow, so my son was not even able to squeeze his feet in. I'm wearing 11M myself.<br />I tried them. And they are both too narrow and too short.<br />My son is very disappointed because he likes the look of the shoes very much.<br />Returning."
3.0,My friend lovrs it!
3.0,"While I appreciate the waterproof nature of this bag, anger perfect size, there are two flaws. One, the zipper is completely redundant. It leaves a 3 inch Gap in either side. Two, the print, and especially the words on it, is just weird. It may only make sense to you if you're a Taiwanese learning English."
3.0,Like the colors. However I ordered the long sleeve of same print. I received the capped/short sleeve version. I don’t even know of this choice when I ordered the long sleeve.
3.0,"Very nice just is not small enough for a person with small wrist. I still kept it, because it is sharp looking."
3.0,"We thought this would be a great suitcase for our kids clothes and for when they get tired when walking long distances in airports, but we're disappointed with the quality.<br /><br />The clips on the strap are a weak plastic that deformed the first time we tried to pull our 30 pound daughter.<br /><br />Also the two latches on the ends don't secure the case very well at the top, it was slightly open with very little clothing inside."
3.0,To sturdiness
3.0,"These are very soft and comfortable, however, I will not be wearing them in public. I'm chunky and these cling to every lump and bump on the legs. They are wonderful for eating Cheez-its and watching Law and Order reruns on a Saturday."
3.0,They were smaller on<br />my face than I had pictured.
3.0,"Seems to be good Workmanship. Material about as thick as a cheap pair of jeans but nice for cap. I like the “washed” look.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the emblem. It has good color now but is a thin iron-on or something. You can see (in the photo) the fabric weave through it. I am sure this will peel off in no time.<br /><br />I purchased for my Census Team as a token of appreciation for crushing UL Operation in record time. If it last through the end of the operation, I’ll be fine with it. Not worth the price though"
3.0,Very very small if you are gifted with large breasts. Unfortunately I have a small waist but big boobs and i couldn’t tie this top over them and it didn’t look good wearing a tank under.
3.0,"Felt really light and fragile more then I thought it would, gonna put a charm on it and hope it don’t break it, but we will see how it holds up. Looks good though"
3.0,"It's a beautiful print.. Very stretchy. I was looking forward to this item being delivered so that I can wear it! How disappointed I was at the color! My beautiful print is only on one side of this fabric! The other side is white! When you use this as a headwrap, both sides need to be the same color otherwise it's going to look ridiculous! Very disappointed. I will have to order something else now."
3.0,Fits good and the wife loves them
3.0,The dress is better quality than I expected it to be at this price. Though it's oddly large in the shoulders and sleeves... Unfortunately did not work for me...
3.0,Fit perfect absolutely love but the second time I wore them now I have a hole in them
3.0,A little thin material.
3.0,comfortable sock. however elastic around ankle stretches and sock slips down.
3.0,Overall very pretty pieces. Great variety. Cheap quality but price point very good.
3.0,The product is beautiful but the hook of the chain is bad.
3.0,I love these and have had several pairs but one screw on the left side had fallen out of every pair I bought so make sure you tighten them and maybe put a drop of super glue on the screws before you wear them
3.0,It is see through so make sure to wear a slip underneath. if you have any lumps and bumps this fabric accentuates it. I ordered an XL and the sleeves and hips are snug.
3.0,It’s a neat dress but would look better on if the mid section seam was more sturdy and prominent to accentuate the beginning of the bottom half because when worn the dress just hangs off the shoulders
3.0,"Instantly knew I was returning this. Definitely a cheap, not conforming type of material at all. Would have maybe kept if it was more jersey-knit. It kind of reminds me of a Gildan tee with a zipper on the back.<br /><br />3 stars for no defects/good packaging and quick shipping, though."
3.0,Super cute top but I would recommend ordering a size down.
3.0,"I was super excited about this dress until I took it out of the package. It looks like they used a pink lining but then using a tan brown lace instead of a pink lace. The photos are not accurate at all. To give you an idea of how much more brown the colors is, I'm a natural medium/tan skin tone Asian girl and the dress was the same skin tone as me. They really need to change the photos as somehow the dress is much lighter than the Caucasian girl in their photos. I will upload photos later."
3.0,Light very barley helpful
3.0,"Super cute, but they were extremely too small"
3.0,"It’s ok, I ordered the 2xx, the fit was ok but the length was short. Not the show in the pic!!!!"
3.0,Bought this skirt for my mom as she was in search of a plain black skirt. She is about 5'2&#34; and this skirt was right a her knees which shorter than expected. She did say it was soft and light weight which would have really worked if this would have been a little longer. I also want to add that I thought that it was somewhat transparent for my liking but mom was more concerned about the length. Will be sending back.
3.0,"Didn't fit over glasses very well, but will work in a pinch."
3.0,Not a big fan of the two dotted pairs but I like the other designs. Beware: they put “Fun Toes” right on the top of the foot :/
3.0,Had to glue one of them. It came apart.
3.0,To small for ankle. Use as a bracelet
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ec4b2837959928bbe18255921603ceec]] It's very nice when it works. Often when trying to upload to the hat, it turns off instead of update. The battery is only about 1 hour, running designs, from the app itself, often colors are not translated well, and lastly, it often turns off from movement, like tipping my hat as I walk by people."
3.0,"Good value for the money,only issue was the earing back for one of them kept slipping out and the tassels were not as vibrant as the photo."
3.0,They were very cute. They were just a little big for my small face even after tightening the ear bands. They fogged my glasses up a lot no matter the position. I could feel the air hit my eyes when I breathed. I really wanted them to work out.
3.0,I don't know why but all the bracelets I have bought breaks by a link or so forth ... :(
3.0,"I liked this shirt but you could fit 2 of me in it.  I am returning it.  I always order an XL which is what I usually wear.  With this company, some fit, some are too tight in the bust and this one was way too big."
3.0,"I love the design and colors, but it is super thin and slinky.  Ok for around the house but would need an under tank to wear in public"
3.0,"Love the style and fit, but the right lens pops out very easily."
3.0,Socks smaller than expected.
3.0,This sweatshirt is cute but it's not true to size. It has no stretch or give to it at all. 100% polyester.  It's especially tight in the shoulders.<br /><br />I ordered a MEDIUM which is what I always wear but I won't even reorder another a size bigger. It was so uncomfortable. I'm dissapointed.
3.0,"Can’t text or do anything intricate with these gloves unless you have unusually long fingers or nail tips.  Just forget texting; otherwise, beautiful and soft gloves-"
3.0,These really are great during rainy season or if you work outside
3.0,"I bought these for the gym. They are ok. I don’t like the waist, it’s not a consistently smoothing high rise.  The very top is tighter than the rest and makes my belly bulge more than other high rise leggings."
3.0,The cover that it comes with is impossible to get back on.
3.0,"Cute, colorful, very large."
3.0,The polka dots on this dress are the perfect size to give you a headache! I kept the dress and made it work by breaking up the pattern and color with a scarf and matching belt. My husband says it still makes him dizzy though...
3.0,It's heavy but I knew that it's made of stainless steel. The movement ends before 24hs without use. I expected more.
3.0,"the fabric is soft but even a size smaller than i usually wear is too loose. the waistband doesn't stay up, and it sags really badly in the crotch area. it feels like you're not even wearing pants, which could be good or bad. they're decent for two for $11, but i won't be buying again"
3.0,"The shirt rides up, neck is a little tight. The material is so soft and lovely to wear. Great designs."
3.0,If you have metal allergies this will cause a reaction.  It fits great and looks just like the photos.
3.0,"I got the black one and the material seems to be very good quality and the pattern is beautiful.<br />The reason why i'm giving this dress only three stars is because, as beautiful as the dress is, this will only look good on you if, like the model, you're very very thin.  Otherwise, this type of dress will only make you look frumpy. I will be keeping this dress instead of returning it, though i'm not sure i'll ever be wearing it.  For reference, I'm generally a size 4 or 6, I'm 5'7&#34; and weight around 135, i'm a 34b.  I have a few spots with extra fluff, though i generally don't feel overweight.  This dress made me look fat, frumpy and unattractive."
3.0,I love these leggings. The only problem  I had was I ordered the &#34;rose impression&#34; style and got  a different pattern. The sticker on the package said rose impression but it did not match the online picture. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
3.0,"My daughter is an average size 12yo. 4'8"", 80ish pounds, athletic build. The 12-14 is too small. Its VERY tight on her. Too bad because otherwise the quality seems really good. Sadly returning."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful and fit as expected.  The only problem with it is that it is completely see through.  I ordered 3 dresses to see which one I liked best.  Had it not been for being see through, I would be getting married in this dress.  I imagine a color other than white might be ok.  The fit is perfect and very flattering."
3.0,"For this mask to be effective , you must wear another mask under it.  The mask is very cute and stylish but not at all effective.  The material is very thin and if you hold the mask up to the light you can see the light through the extremely thin  fabric"
3.0,A big too tight. I got the appropriate waist measurement. Maybe get a size up and have better luck. Back to my old style I suppose.
3.0,"3 stars only because it took a long time to deliver, nice product!"
3.0,Was half the size of another small PattyBoutik sweater I own. Also fabric was very thin compared to the other sweater.
3.0,"This is pretty, and cute !"
3.0,The bathing suit was beyond flattering but when I received it the silver clasp on the back was broken.
3.0,Doesn’t really look like a authentic Moldavite but I still like it as a necklace because it’s green but I’m not really sure if this is real or not so if you’re looking to buy real Moldavite maybe not this one but a good necklace this one
3.0,Somehow feeling tight up
3.0,"Material is thin but appropriately so for summer wear, it was mite tight however wife (size 14) has claimed it and is quite happy."
3.0,"...it is stitched with white thread and you can see it along the seam...it makes it look cheap against this dark fabric. It would be better if sewn with dark thread...that's all. The material feels a tad thin, but not see through. I guess it is what I expected for the price. Hand wash inside out and hang dry so that it doesn't fade and shrink."
3.0,"Even though I selected +2 size, the coat is somewhat small. The design is beautiful but I will not use because it is small."
3.0,Fits just right but no stretch . Had to return
3.0,"I can't really read the text, it was not stamped completely on either side.  I'm not exchanging it, as I doubt any other would be more legible"
3.0,Super short. like ended at my belly button.
3.0,"Good, cute fits well, but the seam is right down the nipple line, so looks weird with some shirts."
3.0,"I ordered this band in the 38/40 For my 5 series watch but they either sent me the bigger band or their sizing is off. The band is too big. I also thought it was red, white and blue but the “white” is actually  a cream color.  While the product itself is fine it’s just not what I expected."
3.0,Cute bows but some were off and uneven. One came apart before it was worn.
3.0,"Got this for my husband for Christmas. I would have given more stars but it fits a little small on his head, but hoping it stretches ot a bit with wear.  He's satisfied with the material - says it keeps his head warm and has great sound."
3.0,Elastic band ripped from stitching after 3 days of regular use.  Disappointed in the quality in regard to the price.
3.0,Nice but cheaply made. Thin material...see through and mine had a small tear.
3.0,The dress was very cute but I ended up reselling it.  It was just too small through the bust and shoulders.
3.0,"Good looking bracelet, would of given 5 stars but cable came apart from the clasp after 3 days."
3.0,It’s good quality but it’s very boxy. Just not made for me.
3.0,"Nice but, a bit big for me"
3.0,"I like it...but it doesn't look like the picture, more like a pink color! But overall nice!"
3.0,Narrow at the ankles for a baby and difficult to put on though so cute!
3.0,"Very tiny, infant or doll size. Did not fit my 2 year old."
3.0,This is too large for me
3.0,I was hoping for a loose fitting comfortable shirt; instead it is tight form fitting.
3.0,too small for a large or one size fits all not true.
3.0,"Confusing to tie at first, but then comfortable shrinks in the wash...pretty cool for what they are. Again tying them is confusing."
3.0,This is a woman shirt no man shirt just for that
3.0,These are thin as I wanted but the top is tighter than comfortable<br />I will probably cut the tops and wear them folded down
3.0,It’s 2 or 3 time smaller than shown size in pictures.
3.0,"After 3 used the stitches are coming loose. Quality is ok at best, I doubt this is product was approved to have the right to use Seadoos logo"
3.0,"Love the shaper, but hate the stays.  They are uncomfortable and unnecessary and I will be removing them.  They poke you under the bust and stick out on the bottom.  Also, not enough support on the lower tummy, just stretchy fabric.  Need to be firming all the way down the front."
3.0,The clover is cute but the chain broke right away.
3.0,The shoe strap didnt stay on i have to close almost every step
3.0,"I like the bracelet but the color of the beads is nothing like the photo. There is no pink or lavender, etc., but instead the bracelet is all earth colors like brown, rust, green. It's a lovely piece, just not what I expected. Unfortunately, I ordered two, one to give as a gift, because my friend loved the colors in the photo. It's disappointing to give her the bracelet when it's not what she was looking forward to getting."
3.0,Soft and a good price but the fit was too small. I'm somewhere between a small and a medium and a large in the item fit snugly. It was weird.
3.0,Super cute and exactly how it looked in the picture! I would definitely recommend getting a size up from what you normally purchase.
3.0,Cute but small!! Size up. I usually where a large but it was tight.
3.0,Cheap and will wear it just disappointed don’t look like picture shown here
3.0,Got it for my girlfriend for our Aruba trip coming up. And fit great got an extra small and the top was to large to keep everything covered
3.0,"Stiff, definitely will need some breaking in."
3.0,I love it but the bacelet to small
3.0,They just feel cheap next to Troy Lee shorts
3.0,Bought this lock and set the combination. Went to use it and it will not open or even allow me to reset it. I have tried to open it with my combination as well as numbers close to it reasoning I might have miss set it. Does not open or reset. I have tried the factory numbers.. Still will not open. I am pretty sure the lock is not working and this is not from a mistake I made.<br />Revised: got hold of company. Replacement lock being sent. I have to give their customer service and respons great Reviews. I will increase my rating based on that
3.0,Decent slipper for the money.
3.0,Good light weight material however the sizes run small. If you have muscular hiking quads you may want to go up two sizes!
3.0,It feels light and airy. It's a true wrap dress..it will need ironing!
3.0,"I bought these in a smaller size for ice skating practice. had to size up and ordered a “small” for my 5/6 S son, which was a gamble in the first place. they sent a medium and they’re a little loose but lucky for me they sent a belt with it and he’ll grow into them. they are warm and pretty water resistant for the ice rink."
3.0,"Es muy bonito, lo único es que es muy ancho de abajo"
3.0,"I would have worn the necklace but the clasp broke as soon as I tried it on for the first time.  The earrings were poorly made with the gems looking like they were were glued on sideways.  Aside from all that, the blue is really pretty but darn, not meant for me!"
3.0,"The shirt fits good, but the sleeves are too short."
3.0,"the length is great (I am 5'11&#34; and probably 190, so a bit chunky.  I ordered the pants in XL tall, which turned out to be a bit loose.  Maybe the fabric needs to be a bit higher in lytcra content.  Anyway, I'm keeping them as they are comfy and the rise is high enough (usually a problem), but I'll have to keep looking for the stretch slacks I was hunting for travel.  These stretch out a bit too much for long plane rides."
3.0,I expected the quality to be better. The pents are thinner than I expected.
3.0,I love the color and style I believe a few stripes were not like the rest and the pockets fit off with my curvy hips . Otherwise I liked this ! I am size 6 woman's and large fit small /perfect fit.
3.0,Very cute and very stretchy. Bought for my niece who loved it. Bought a Large for a size 12/14
3.0,"Westies are white dogs, the Westie Pn this charm is quite yellowish. Other than that It's a nice charm."
3.0,Fit is much smaller than the size.
3.0,Nice but not good for 30s weather. My fingers were like ice in these gloves.
3.0,Cute but the gold fades easy
3.0,"Ordered the 9-24 mo size, but it’s large enough for my head! My daughter’s head is in the 80th %ile and she’s 14 mo old- for reference. Looks cozy and warm! But the ear flaps don’t rest on her ears. Will be returning."
3.0,Nothing  like the picture.  Too short and not flattering on me.. just no. 5’6” and 150
3.0,"this fabric is soft but very thin. I consider myself in reasonable shape, but this will still require full shapewear underneath, and likely will be able to see the seams of it. Also the sleeves are too wide at the bottom, at least for the small. This cut and style would look much better with fitted sleeves, so I'd have to get it tailored if I keep it. Still on the fence."
3.0,"Love the color and fabric,but it was way too boxy.  There was just too much fabric for my frame."
3.0,"Reasonably well constructed non-corrective glasses. Comes with a little blue light flashlight to confirm that shorter wavelength light is blocked by the glasses, which it does. Looks cute in a librarian way on my wife."
3.0,Cute but the letters are starting to come off.
3.0,"Just received this as a gift and it's adorable. The liner is a suuuper cheap material, but hey - you get what you pay for. For fifteen bucks it's a great tote and it holds all of mine and my toddler's stuff. What more could I really ask for?"
3.0,"I was so excited for this top as I have a couple others of similar style. It seems as if the neckline is high but that’s not the case at all. Once you put the shirt on, the weight of it pulls it down and you have a nice scoop neck shirt.<br />Here’s where I give great caution. I snagged it 3 times in the first 10 mins of wearing it. The knit is so loose that everything snagged it. My watch band snagged it and my purse snagged it. I wasn’t even wearing my wedding ring otherwise that would’ve snagged it as well. So, for me, that makes a really impractical top. So many of us wear jewelry of some kind. And I didn’t even think that my watch was “pokey” but apparently it is.<br />I wore this shirt for 1.5 hours and I had 9 snags I had to fix. I immediately changed it. Some I was able to just thread back to the other side and some had bigger holes. I was very disappointed.<br />I do love the shirt, it’s a nicer top. But I will plan accordingly.<br />It has excellent length and may even bit a bit bulky, but regardless I still love it. I’m tall and I so rarely have shirts that are long enough for me. But being worried about how I’m destroying it by moving? It really takes away from it."
3.0,The dress is beautiful but small but will give to a relative so it's all good thank you
3.0,I ordered an xxl it still ran small. I gave it away to my mom. And it got those fuzzy lint balls quickly. My mom keeps removing them with a lint roller or shaves them off.
3.0,"i adore this necklace, its super cute, but the pendant it made from plastic so you have to be careful with it."
3.0,Ok...very thin and a bit long.
3.0,Love the look but runs way small
3.0,Very pretty but hard to put them on so I don't wake at often. If not for that I'd give 5 stars.
3.0,Not a true seven! I were seven on my middle finger and missed it not fit. Was too small!
3.0,"The skirt is nice, but the top is a little big, the arms are loose and it doesn't hug like it shows on the picture. Also the back with the zipper falls a little weirdly on my shoulders. I'm 5'0 and 96 pds so maybe I'm just too small to fit correctly, but I gave to my sister and it fit her better than it did on me - she likes it."
3.0,Cute but ran small. Order about two sizes up.
3.0,Not quite what I was expecting from the photo but hard to argue given the price.
3.0,Bought these for a bachelorette party (cat themed) It didn't take long for them to rip in the crouch. But I do admit that they were comfortable for the night.
3.0,"The winder mechanism sticks, but works great if you manually wind it. Get compliments from people all the time."
3.0,Nice selection of different styles but they shift around a lot and I found myself having to check constantly to make sure they weren't crooked.<br /><br />I've used other tie clips that disperse the pressure from the clip more evenly thus requiring less checking.
3.0,"Girls sweatshirt, runs small order up a size or 2."
3.0,My dress arrived today but I am going to return it because it looks cheap.
3.0,"The idea of this dress is great but the design is printed on the fabric and looks cheap. Also, waistband hits higher than shown in photo."
3.0,"Although I like the look of the watch, I gave 3 stars because the buttons for the week & hour arrived D.O.A. Only the main crown functioned properly. Also, date window is too small. Did not return it because I have no use for the other 2 buttons."
3.0,Used as dress pursr
3.0,"I didn't order this the first time due to the reviews, and ordered another black top. But it is sweater material, so I came back and ordered this top. What do I like? The look, the feel of the fabric, the sleek look on my body that needs to lose 15- 20 lbs. What don't I like, the sleeves are almost too tight. I may need to lose weight, but that is in my hips, not my upper arms. But I'm still keeping it. Also I have a small bust, and this fits fine. Not sure how someone with a larger bust line would do with this top. Maybe mine was a second? I ordered an XL, and no larger sizes were available."
3.0,"This two piece lounge set is cute and comfy, but the fit is a little weird. The top is very boxy and unflattering, but VERY soft. The pants are stretchy but thin. The logo on the pants is grey, not the same light green as the logo on the top so it doesn't match which isn't a big deal, but it bugs me. Also, the color is less avocado as described, and more of a mossy/olive green. It isn't terrible but it isn't awesome either. Just kinda meh."
3.0,I order most clothing a size up as I prefer things on the loose side so I ordered a size L.  This dress has a charming pattern and the fabric is ok but it is cut for someone who is quite slender.  Even the sleeves were snug.  too bad!
3.0,I don’t see how any adult could wear this comfortably. If I wore it for more than 5 mins it’d give me a headache. Makes a cool decoration though.
3.0,"Nice looking bracelet but nearly impossible to open to retrieve the Fitbit!  First clue was the triangular pick that came with it.  After wearing it for the day, I finally had to get a small knife to open it.  The plastic pick just couldn’t get into the narrow slot to open it."
3.0,I love this dress but I do have issues with it. The biggest problem is that the belt that comes with the dress is a completely different color from the straps. I'm going to see if I can get ribbon to match the straps.
3.0,Loved it but it came with a hole.
3.0,Liked how the gold accents gave these a shimmery stylish look. Material isn’t overlay  stretchy or hot. Didn’t find leggings to be very form fitting. They were very high waisted but the tummy control was lacking. Would have been cool if these had pockets. Not flattering for my body type. Recommend still.
3.0,Looked exactly like I expected when worn. Only issue I had was the pocket started to pull away after a couple washes and stringers began to stretch.
3.0,It works but for wide noses it’s a bit of a stretch.
3.0,"Although I returned this it was a beautiful dress for the price. I am 5'1 , 120 pounds and 7 months pregnant. I purchased this because I wanted to wear it to my baby shower but it was just a size too big and I ordered a small so I would say this runs big. The arms were loose and the bra area was a little loose. I am an 34A so that could be a problem. The length was great if I wanted to wear heels or sandals it would've looked beautiful."
3.0,"I did not like the fact that the colors of the earrings are slightly different than the photos.  I guess with buying online, you cannot try the items on.  One earring fell out while I was driving, I had to dig under the seats to find it.  I guess it looks nice in the photos but don't look good on me in person.<br />Very long and dangly.  Secure them on your ear with a plastic earring backing or something."
3.0,"For the price, i was expecting better."
3.0,"this is very cute but would fit a little girl of about 100 Lbs. nicely, i did not return it but gave it away to somebody in need."
3.0,Cute but.. top ran big and bottoms ran small.
3.0,"Two pairs fit perfectly and were very comfortable, the black pair must be a size small and have no stretch to them at all.<br />Won't be purchasing them again."
3.0,Boyfriend liked it. I thought it was a little cheap looking for the price.
3.0,I used these ears for myself and they're way too small for an adult. The length of the band is obviously fitted for a kid. Very disappointed.
3.0,Typical print tee quality
3.0,I liked the light weight t shirt material and it fit as expected.  I have a long torso so it wasn't as long as the picture but still was long enough to be comfortable and not have my stomach show when i lifted my arms.
3.0,"The material is not what I expected, but it has lot of pockets which is a plus"
3.0,Returned want my method of payment thank you
3.0,"These KKP aviator sunglasses are probably the most comfortable pair of sunglasses I have at the moment. At least for the moment, they are exactly tight enough to stay in place without causing me any discomfort around the ear or nose pieces. That's a huge plus, and I attribute that to the glasses being both very well-constructed and very lightweight, a nice combination.<br /><br />My only problem with these - and it's a big problem for me - is that the lenses allow considerably more light to reach my eyes than I expect a pair of sunglasses to let in. These are one of the very few sunglasses that I actually find myself still squinting a bit while wearing them during the middle of the day. I actually reached up at one point to make sure that I was wearing them (that's how comfortable they can be) after realizing that I was having to squint while walking toward the sun. I suppose the good news is that they can be worn safely later in the day while driving - I like to use polarized lenses like these to help me pick up more detail while driving. So there is a bit of a trade-off there.<br /><br />The sunglasses do seem to be a little expensive, all things considered, but if they eventually prove to be more durable than average (something only time will tell) that would make them worth the higher cost.<br /><br />Bottom Line: These are for those who prefer a little more light reaching their eyes while still getting the other benefits of wearing sunglasses."
3.0,"Not the best quality. For the price, I guess it's okay."
3.0,"It os a good color, but i don't like the way it fit me."
3.0,It like he look of it and how you can put your cards and id on the part that you can take out cos it makes it easy when you go out.The downside  for me was that was that the clips are positioned where it makes things annoying. Every time i want to get something from the zipper
3.0,"The glasses were great quality but they were too small for my face. I looked like Jon Lennon but instead of circular glasses, they're heart shaped."
3.0,Shoe is very durable but runs a little large in the length and the backstrap does not adjust.
3.0,Very small. Not for adults. I bought 2 and one broke the first time wearing it but the other one was still pretty.
3.0,"Very cute, light weight, just a bit bigger than I expected, so they don’t fit my toddler yet."
3.0,I like the material it was made of
3.0,They are cute earrings the only thing I don’t like is u can tell how fake they are because of the openings on all of them . It has the lil holes that show where the plates are attached
3.0,"I thought a simple hope would be very versatile, however these earrings are so heavy I don’t wear them as often as I had planned."
3.0,Didn't realize there would be feathers on it.
3.0,"These gloves are so warm & comfortable! I love them. They’d get a 5 star rating if the touch screen fingers worked. They don’t at all. But for $13, I don’t realky care."
3.0,"Its cool besides,  you can see where the press laid the design not super noticable but makes it look cheap"
3.0,"Sized up based on reviews. When i got it, it looked like a blanket. Was way too big. I should have bought my size or sized down.."
3.0,These are medium but too big for me.
3.0,"I found the sizing to be fairly accurate if a little on the baggy side. My problem dealt with the padding which felt to me to be stiff (as opposed to what you might expect with a gel-type padding). Over the course of a 25 minute street ride (a bit bumpy but not out of the ordinary) I found the shorts to be as painful or more painful than my rides without the shorts -- more of a constant pressure kind of pain as opposed to a sharp pain caused by a sudden hit. I did find the first 5 minutes to be pretty enjoyable and remember thinking, &#34;the padding works great!&#34; but the constant pressure eventually made me feel really sore as the ride wore on. I have sent these shorts back for a return -- it may be the case that this kind of padding just doesn't suit everyone. On the other hand, I found the shorts themselves to be of generally good quality with apparently solid stitching and what seemed to be sturdy (fabric. As another reviewer mentioned I think I would have liked more (and perhaps deeper) pockets."
3.0,"The pilling is incredible, I've got bits of pilled sock all over the back of my shoes after wearing them. The toe area and the back of the sock itself is covered in lumps of worn off fiber after one wear and it only gets worse as they're washed and reworn. I seriously doubt they'll last long.<br />However, they're comfy and warm. I'll replace them with something better quality later, but these will do for now."
3.0,The shirt fit well initially but shrunk over time  I got a medium originally.
3.0,A shade on the snug side. I should have read and scrutinized the description of this product more thoroughly; shame on me.
3.0,This is a heavier material than I thought when I ordered it without any give. Very cute but runs 2-3 sizes small.
3.0,It was too small. Had to return it.
3.0,"This sweater is not as vibrant as the picture! The blue is almost navy, definitely not a royal blue."
3.0,The knots tend to slip so after an hour you end up with it sliding down your shirt rather then stay firm on your neck
3.0,"Loved the bright colors, but I have muscular/ larger calf’s and 3 of 5 pair kept inching down my leg, very annoyingly slow. I do not put in dryer. When I take them out of the washer, I try to shape and gently stretch them, followed by hang dry. No luck-I’m stuck."
3.0,"I recieved the pants, took awhile before they arrived.  Liked the Jean's, they fit except the back dips down really far like short waisted pants. The front is fine but the back is a different story.  It felt like they were going to fall down.  Forget about sitting down, half of you butt would show.  They approved a return, with you paying the return shipping.  Well guess what!  They go to China!  The lowest cost was $27.00 & that was without NO tracking or guarantee or proof they recieved it!  Well you might as well keep the pants!  The cost on the pants was $32.88!  Amazon should stand behind there sellers that they let on there site!  They should not let China sell on Amazon.  No way can you return them.  You might as well keep it.  They don't even bother to tell you they are from China!  Not a happy Customer!!! 😡"
3.0,I was looking for a beach bag and saw someone at the pool had one of these. Got it yesterday and it's no were near as big as they advertised. So if you are looking for the big one  this is not it.
3.0,Size small was loose on me.
3.0,I do like this it is hard for me to put on since it buttons up in the back.  But still a good sports bra. breathable fabric and it holds you in pretty good.  Good for me since I am top heavy
3.0,Not all that great.
3.0,Not quite what I expected.  The beads look nice and arrived quickly. I am disappointed they do not have the traditional knotting between each bead but for the price they are well made and have a pleasant scent.
3.0,Loved the way the purse looked. It was perfect size.<br />It was very heavy with nothing in it.<br />The lining of the pockets ripped within the first month.<br />The silver along the top started wearing off in 2 weeks of use.
3.0,I must have longer legs... I have trouble finding yoga pants that are long enough and that don't shrink too much in the wash (cold water).  These are a tad short.  I usually go for 33&#34; inseam.  I tried the large size.  Otherwise they are what you pay for - on the cheaper side for materials.
3.0,"These are cute (white with stars,) and seem well made, but not what I expected! They have pockets and lining, which makes them a little stiff as opposed to that true boxer/PJ bottoms fit. I thought maybe I had accidentally bought regular shorts. They may be better suitrd for lounge wear, but i don’t expect they would be as comfortable for sleeping."
3.0,"This is a lovely cardigan, but the sleeves were too tight. I had to return it."
3.0,"I bought the leg warmers strictly for warmth. I wanted something comfortable, soft, and warm for my legs that didn't feel like cheap acrylic yarn. Unfortunately these all-cotton leg warmers aren't soft enough for someone with neuropathy. They also got baggy pretty fast. It would have been nice to be able to shrink them in the dryer, but that didn't happen. Certainly that would be a plus for most people though."
3.0,"This came with a very musty smell, like it had been stored in a damp basement.  I had to wash it twice before I could wear it."
3.0,"As they say, you get what you pay for.  Since they are so cheap they appear to have the color change on them pretty fast"
3.0,Boots were of good construction just very narrow.
3.0,I like the bands appearance but it doesn’t stay hooked to my Blaze Fitbit.
3.0,"It is not a statement piece. I was expecting something more sturdy, but for the price I have no regrets"
3.0,"Fast delivery, cute but cheap. Got what I paid for."
3.0,"The neck piece is fixed, you can  not adjust it. That makes the whole dress hang very low in the boob area. I ordered a small it was too big."
3.0,It’s pretty but runs to smalI bought to wear at my wedding and I don’t have time to reorder it’s a waste I bought an XL still fits like a medium
3.0,They don't really fit well but I can make it work. they're still very cute and I can't wait to wear them.
3.0,"When this arrived in the mail, the packaging was completely fine but the cross had multiple cracks in it. It was still a nice piece for the car but the front of the cross had cracks. The words were still visible & easy to read but I am disappointed that it came in the mail already damaged. The chain is also very little & can barely fit around the car's mirror."
3.0,Like them but hurt after awhile due to weight
3.0,"I liked that it was fitted, the material wasn’t super soft but it was fine. What ruined it for me was the horrible, barely functioning zipper. If it wasn’t for the zipper I’d give it four stars."
3.0,"I actually really like this product, but I'm giving it a 3 because the first zipper broke after just a couple of months.  I purchased a new one, but there's already something weird going on with this zipper.  There are other choices, I tried one of them - one that had an ID holder on the outside - and didn't care for it, so I went with this one again.  Although the zipper doesn't quite close all the way without a struggle on my current wallet, I'll stick with it.  I am hope that the zipper holds on for a good long while."
3.0,Nice looking watch but not keeping time very well.
3.0,"My main complaint is the very rough and scratchy fabric and the poor construction. The ruffles are finished with a visible stitch on the raw edge. The thread belt loops look cheap.<br /><br />Perfect maxi length on me (5’6”). I love the design, it’s fitted with some ease. The belt allows you to define your waist more if desired."
3.0,Great product for the price but runs small.
3.0,Good quality but has to be pulled over your head and that is not comfortable and it also messes up your hair.
3.0,Be warned it will last for about 6 months and then zipper will break. If you are into buying a new one every six months this is for you. Otherwise look for better quality product. I will say the product served its purpose while it worked.
3.0,Really pretty. Having a little trouble getting the screw back in correctly.
3.0,"It’s ok.  Only problem is it does not perfectly fit - handle holes are not aligned to my luggage.  But, really not that big of a deal."
3.0,"It was too loose too short on me, but I'm 5'5"" and 108 pounds.  The dress was a beautiful mustard yellow, but I was a bit weirded out by the cut in real life."
3.0,My daughter hoped it would fit like in the picture. But it was more loose and no pockets
3.0,It's pretty but it's hard to put on
3.0,"I'm not sure the pearls are real, but I didn't pay a lot and it looks great on."
3.0,The skirt is nothing like the picture- it’s silk material and it’s woven together instead of a two layer skirt like it seems. The top part is pretty see-through as well but it’s nice enough for ren faire and it fits like expected!
3.0,Color in picture doesnt show exactly what the color is and I like the bigger fit so wish I would have gotten a larger size even tho I'm a 30 waist otherwise a good quality product and the company is fast and friendly will buy again just a larger size like I got the first time those are my favorite chill pants hands down
3.0,"This fascinator is very pretty, but it is poorly made. The stone was loose in the bag when it was delivered, so I had to glue it back in place.  By the end of the event which I purchased it for, the actual body of it had become unstuck from the pin attachment.  VERY VERY poorly made.  It was however very effective with the outfit I purchased it for."
3.0,Cute shirt but would fit a child better.
3.0,Heavier than the plain foam visor I usually get.
3.0,"These ran a little big, should have gotten a size smaller!"
3.0,"Looks like pic, nice, but run too small"
3.0,"This broke almost immediately, but I enjoyed it while it lasted"
3.0,"These socks are okay, but not my favorite. They are a little on the thin side, but they thickened up and softened up a bit when they were washed. I wear a size 7 shoe, and these fit me just fine. I guess my biggest complaint was the thickness of the band at the top of the sock. They were a little tight on me and were bulky underneath the slim legs of my jeans."
3.0,I don't have overly large wrists but these bracelets are too small on me.
3.0,"Very thin, which I excpected for the price. However, will still make nice gifts for my bridesmaids. The white is too shear to wear because it is see through, but the navy will work just fine."
3.0,"These are super cute, but I'm really bummed because the blue one split down the side after being in my purse for one day. It was only holding a pressed powder compact, a retractable make up brush, mascara, hand lotion and some tissues. The bag splitting caused everythjng to spill out into my purse and the top to my kabuki brush broke because of it. Guess the blue one just missed the quality control check. The other two bags have been great, though!"
3.0,"I would have to say that the price is hard to beat but the darn face of the watch will not light up enough to see when it's dark! What is the purpose of this light? I replaced it once, thinking the battery was low but now I think it's just poor design."
3.0,When washed they seem to become smaller. Most likely would not buy this brand again. Paid about $20 for 12 pairs I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,These are for children.  Did not even fit over an adultS head.
3.0,"The fit and cut of this top is true to size.A bit tight in the sleeve.The sleeves are not long,but 3/4.This was disappointing.Material is a bit thin and can be clingy."
3.0,"These were very thin, I expected these to be a thicker cotton material"
3.0,"My daughter has this duffel, she purchased it from a VERA BRADLEY STORE.  It has a shoulder strap that hooks on to each end of the bag in addition to the 2 straps shown.  The duffel I ordered from this retailer did NOT have the 3rd strap.  I would not have ordered if I had noticed that earlier, appears to have tabs for the strap, but my mistake in not looking more closely."
3.0,Comfortable but pulled after first wash.
3.0,"The print quality was not that good, and there is strange chemical smell on it."
3.0,On
3.0,It is nice but too small it will fit to a small girl even if I bought xl. I thought i would order again in different color but no way for me to wear. I just gave it to a 12 yr old skinny girl. But the seller Is nice and responsive easily answer questions!
3.0,Love the glasses but they are HUGE!!!! I’m bummed because I love the glasses but I can’t wear them like that.
3.0,"I liked the bag but I thought it was bigger. It looks bigger in the pictures where a women carry it. And one more thing I did not like, there was a hard bottom. It was not confortable. So I returned it."
3.0,Shoe was cute but definitely not made for people with skinny feet. The straps were to big and I had to return
3.0,"so i love these type of bracelets, but...it broke first time I wore it.  One of the strings popped out.  The second time I wore it, another string popped out.  The materies are quality, real leather and hemp strings, but also a bit scratchy.  I'm sure the scratchiness would soften over time.  The beads and charm are also good quality.  I love the adjustability of the bracelet, unfortunately it just didn't stay together."
3.0,Needed more support from the top.  Loved the bottoms.
3.0,it was just ok
3.0,"Size too small, too tight"
3.0,Smelled
3.0,Nice blouse but it is to tight.
3.0,Bulky. Always getting caught on something. Do yourself a favor and get one that just hold you I.D. trust me.
3.0,The outfit looks and fits great. The problem is that the buttons on the outfit kept falling off.
3.0,not an exact match to lv pouchette but good quality
3.0,Blocks the sounds okay but seems cheaply made.
3.0,"The product is a good one - does it's job and is easy to install in the hatband.  That got it 3 stars.  It would have been good enough for 5 stars if it weren't for the incredible frustration [like most everyone else had] of separating the backing from the foam.  ARGH!  Yes, ultimately the right knife worked.  The knife I used was a Swiss army knife with a very sharp, very clean, very thin 2&#34; blade.  It was still no cakewalk.  I wasted the better part of a foot of the tape with false starts.  Most times when I gently, carefully, steadily attempted to insert the blade between the foam and white backing a fine layer of foam remained on the tape. That fine layer made it impossible to pull the two layers apart.<br />I have a suggestion if you decide to buy this product: Don't cut all the sections of the foam and tape that you'll need at the start.  Every piece will require another session with the knife.  Start with the beginning of the whole roll.  Try to get the corners or edge of the beginning separated with your knife.  If you end up trashing the the end without separating the layers, cut the end off so you have a new edge to work with.  Eventually if the hat gods are kind you'll free a tiny bit of the backing from the foam.  Now using your fingernail increase the separation until you can grasp the foam in one hand and the backing in the other.  Peel the layers apart til you have the right length.  Cut ONLY the foam piece off leaving the tape still attached to the roll.  Once you've placed that first piece in your hat it should be pretty easy to start peeling apart the next section you need.  When your hat is the right size leave a tape tail on the end of the roll so you have something to grab the next time."
3.0,"plastic, plastic everywhere"
3.0,"I ordered these to wear to reformer pilates.  These socks fit as expected; I wear an 8.5 shoe. The grips on the bottom do add great friction to keep you from slipping.  If you prefer thicker socks (like I do) you should pass on these.  However, if you prefer this socks - order these!"
3.0,I thoutght it would be bigeer :) buts okay its smaal but not so good I expected ))))
3.0,"I have another pair of these exact same pants just with a straight leg, and they fit great.  These ones, however... I could barely get them up over my hips without ripping the seams.  Once I got them up they were fine--not really that tight; but I wouldn't want to go through that ordeal every morning so I returned them.  Not sure if I got a defective pair or what--it's not like I have some major hourglass figure, just a normal middle-aged hip to waist ratio!  They just don't seem to be built for someone with any kind of hips/booty."
3.0,I love this tank but it’s definitely not for running or any intense exercise
3.0,"Overall it's OK, just a couple of things: 1) the color is not exactly as on picture, it's not that golden (even into mustardy), it's obviously of lemony color, and I looked forward to the color exactly as on picture; 2) the smaller items (card and key holders) are cheaply made, and the pouch is unevenly sewn."
3.0,Can't get the creases out.
3.0,Shoes run way too small both in length and width! I would return but would have to pay for shipping!
3.0,This was broken when I received it.
3.0,A little small but I still wear them
3.0,Pants fit great the shirt is extremely small and can't move in it cause I might pop a button and the wig I very cheaply made an definitely not like the picture. I would suggest if your getting it get the next size up
3.0,"The value of these sleep bonnets were good.  I got 3. They are adjustable, but they don't fit certain hairstyles.  Mine still kept sliding off."
3.0,Its a very thin material. I thought i was going to be thicker. It is still cute but its not what I was expecting.
3.0,The cut is very strange. It does not sit right when worn. And does not fold well either. Husband loved it despite this minor issues.
3.0,Letters on front were white rather than gold and needed to be a size larger.
3.0,"Fit well for the hip and legs, too loose for the waistband. Zero compress for the tummy or waist area.<br />Btw, I’m a small/medium for legging, I got this in small."
3.0,Image smaller than appears and bad quality screening
3.0,"More than 3-stars; not quite 4. I'm curvy and this fits more like a tunic. The stitching is a little uneven, but for the price, easy to overlook."
3.0,"Very cute boot, super uncomfortable after wearing for a few hours"
3.0,Fit is so awkward and the belt is cheap. Into the donation box it goes.
3.0,I like my wife sent back for larger size. So can’t review just yet thanks
3.0,"Not really ""stud"" size appropriate"
3.0,"I really wanted these to work. The fabric seemed really nice and the colors are GORGEOUS. However, I'm 5'7&#34; and these fit like belly shirts. They are so short! Maybe if they were 2-3 inches longer it may work but there's no way. Sadly I have to return them."
3.0,"My daughter loves it, she rides it all over the house. Have to have wood flooring. Doesn’t roll well on carpet or rugs"
3.0,Beautiful but had a 6 month delivery time.
3.0,The pendent is smaller than i thought it was. The picture is bigger than it really is. The &#34;letter&#34; on it is kind of faint. Definitely not as the picture shows. I do like it but wish was a bit bigger. Also hate how it closes at the back. You have to use the extender that comes with it. Otherwise it wont even close. Overall fairly good product. The product arrived on time with no issue.
3.0,"This dress was different and elegant.  But it was also too heavy.  Well made, but very heavy.  We live in a pretty moderate climate, and I could not imagine a time when I would be comfortable, temperature wise, wearing it.  I would roast!"
3.0,"I really like these. My eyes instantly noticed a difference and felt better looking at my computer screen. I would give it 4-5 stars except the hinges already feel a bit loose and the glasses are tight. I would really like to wear these for my whole computer session, but it ends up hurting too much to keep on."
3.0,After I wore the pants they became loose and sloppy looking.
3.0,The arms on the largest size(xxl) were that of a small. They left marks on my arms from trying to wear it. I thought maybe it was just the liner was too small. So I took out the liner from the arms and still too small. It is a beautiful coat. But it's arms are constructed for a much smaller size.
3.0,They are pretty cute and look just like the pic. Sadly the back is loose fitting and I'm always afraid that it'll slip off. It's nice to wear them at a desk job but not for going out.
3.0,To small but i have plenty people n my family i can give it to so no worries especially with the price
3.0,Super cool but to small. I returned it
3.0,pockets are not deep enough like most men's shorts. Price is excellent.
3.0,Runs big and it's a knit slinky shirt not a cotton tshirt. It's a cream colour not white. The pineapple is not screened on it's a rubber heat apply image.
3.0,This product is nice enough looking but it is on the short side and does not fit many of my collars even though they are not spread collars. The gap between each side of the collar after your tie is tied must be very narrow indeed for this collar bar to work.
3.0,Comfy but why is it so hard to make an elastic waistband that doesn’t roll. So annoying. They are cute but not as cute as pictures and not for the price. Would not buy again or recommend
3.0,"The watch is nice. I removed a couple links in order for it to fit me, as i anticipated. The shade of gold is a little too golden for my liking but it could work i guess. i thought it would have been a lighter shade of gold. Also, the minute hand makes subtle movements when the second hand ticks. But despite it all, its a pretty neat watch."
3.0,"This skirt is made of bathing suit material,you may wonder what does that mean, well ,the material is slinky,  , it's on the small side, so If you're usually Medium I suggest going to large it will not be too big.Because of the material, I don't think it's suitable for a professional environment Ido love the length."
3.0,"The size runs one or two sizes too small so I ended up giving them away. I even adjusted the sizing like other comments stated. All that said, they look like a nice pair of light-weight pants."
3.0,Im a size 5 and this metal belt had no way to close  or fit.
3.0,Dress fits as described. Material is kind of thin.
3.0,"This pantsuit is nice. It has the sheer part that adds an appeal to the suit for parties or event. The material wrinkles very easily it seems, since I received it very wrinkle. I didn't like it when i got it and almost returned it. But, when I put it on, it fit my body nicely, so I kept it. I got the large and it needed no modification. Length of crotch; sleeves and legs were ok for my size and build. I'm 4'11; 150lbs; 36DD; curvy but not overly with a slight stomach. I wore it with a belt purchased on amazon to give it a flare. I like the pantsuit but wish it had pockets and the material was better quality."
3.0,This wallet is smaller than I thought but it's very good quality. There's tons of card slots which is always nice. Plenty of space for cash and coins. The gold writing on the front is not what shows in the photo on mine. Mine says Your Choice which looks a little weird.
3.0,"The fit was pretty much how I had expected, however I wish they were a little longer.  They don't have the compression I was looking for.  All in all you cant beat the price for three tank tops."
3.0,Had an allergic reaction but that could be my fault not reading the description. Some of the balls broke off immediately when putting them in but it's a good value for your money if your not allergic to the metal and don't mind a few balls breaking off
3.0,"Meh.  These are okay. They are very cute, but they don't stay on, which sort of defeats the purpose."
3.0,"I loved this sweater however it is to small, size up!"
3.0,They are cute but had to return them.
3.0,"The quality of this strap seems just fine, but I was disappointed to find this is a Nato strap, not a Zulu strap as described. A NATO strap has two pieces of strap under the watch and a Zulu is supposed to have just one. I should have looked at the customer photos. As others have noted, the strap is very short. I have skinny 7 1/8&#34; wrists and there is BARELY enough strap to fold into the the upper buckle."
3.0,"I find that there is so much padding at the &#34;sit&#34; bones, that I get irritated in that area. It's also a nuisance to wash and dry it every single day. I've reverted to wearing soft cotton shorts for my rides."
3.0,"Pants seem to run a bit big over all and they were to short for me, fabric nice and soft but weave a bit loose"
3.0,The writing needed to be updated
3.0,"It's very lightweight, not as solid as I'd hoped and I ended up just about unwinding it entirely trying to get it off the first time. But because it's so light, I was able to rebend it to fit me a little better so now it comes off with less effort. That said, it's not a bracelet that I will wear a lot. It's too annoying with all the space it takes up on my arm. Disappointing because I had hoped to wear it a lot. Maybe I can get used to it. If not, it will be a great costume element."
3.0,"I don't know how I ordered size SMALL when I was searching for XL.  I would not have done that intentionally.  They arrived in good condition and they were very small, so I have to return them.  They don't seem to have XL at this time."
3.0,"These are so cute and there are a lot of options but the gauge size is all over the place so if you don't have a lot of piercings of different gauge size, you really won't be able to use some of these. I have a small nose piercing and could use the hoops and one other piercing but all the others are the wrong gauge size and I have no interest in enlarging my piercing. So overall these are very nice but it makes more sense, if you have only a few piercings or use all the same gauge, to buy sets that are one size."
3.0,Material is smooth and is not very stretchy
3.0,Nice design. But so little.
3.0,They were good. Didn’t last long if you dance a lot.
3.0,You get what you pay for. Some parts are glass beads others are plastic.
3.0,"Love the sweater, but although it was marked XL it was more like Large. I love the feel of the material and the design."
3.0,"Wish I got a different color. I realized the red with whit polka dots looks like Minnie mouse. Oh well, I guess I know what I'll be for Halloween"
3.0,"it's soft but worth noting they run smaller than expected, snug"
3.0,"Super cute! I bought this for an event to go with my ensemble. I gave it 3 stars because the little trinkets hanging were following off, you get what you pay for.<br />I received many complaints."
3.0,What not color pictured...green instead desired flesh color.
3.0,"I expected more from Nike. I feel no compression. I am not sure what the stripes are for besides decoration. For the price, I thought I would fly during my workouts. Sadly, I was mistaken.  I wish I had spent the money on my favorite under armor for 1/3 the price."
3.0,"These pants are sooo beautiful but ridiculously small!! The color is spot on to the picture but the size. Oh, the size. Lol Let's just say to be safe I ordered an XXL. I'm normally a 10/12 USA size. They were SO small they are now my 90lb 13 year olds. She's pretty happy with them. Lol Just know if you buy them they run reeeeeeally small."
3.0,"This isn't a bad shirt. It fits well and fabric is soft and breathable. I really like it, save for the fact I now look like a brand new traffic cone. This is a VERY bright orange. I'm a walking highlighter. I don't need a reflective belt for running on base. Other than that. Not bad at all."
3.0,Nice fancy dickey
3.0,"This is a 10 year old girl she wears a girls 10slim. this skirt fit her but was very short and a bit tight.  No way it would fit a bigger size.  We also used it on a girl 8 and she is more petite and it was okay.  It worked for what we needed it for, but I would definitely measure the length before purchasing.  After reading the reviews I was under the impression it would fit multiple sizes, but its better for a girls size 8 and smaller."
3.0,After reading other reviews I ordered 2 sizes up and it fit well. I didn't keep it because another shirt fit better and had better quality materials.
3.0,the  hat  is  cute  i  have  a  small  head  if  you  are  bigger  it  will  not  fit  going to  the  beach  mexico
3.0,I really love the quality of these earrings but they are SO HEAVY. I wish I could wear them.
3.0,It’s ok.  Not great.
3.0,"I wear a size 7-7.5, I'm 5', 130lbs. Socks are big in the feet area, but they are cute and stay put pretty well. I'd buy them again."
3.0,I am sad because this dress would be super cute but I ordered it bigger due to reviews. I would say it runs more as expected than small.
3.0,This is a $10 scarf at best.
3.0,Fits as expected but not long as i had hoped
3.0,Cute shirt but runs small may want to size up!
3.0,For the price you get what you get. My cameo was off center so I popped it out with my fingernail and glued it back in centered. Pretty otherwise. Hope the glue holds.
3.0,This style wasn’t for me. The clip on the outside made getting it out of my pocket hard and there wasn’t as much room in the front pockets as I had hoped.<br /><br />It looks good seemed of good quality. Just not for me.
3.0,"If you want a little humor, this mask will provide that. He has a beard in the same color scheme so thought it would blend in a little but it definitely doesn't.  Wasn't expecting the nose to be so wide so have a good chuckle when he puts it on.  During a pandemic, a good laugh is needed.  He said it was comfortable to wear since it is a bit on the larger side and may actually be one of his favorites though."
3.0,I like the hat. It the graphic just looks like I ironed it on myself.
3.0,"too big for my petite 4yo, a bit small for my average 8yo. Really stylish though."
3.0,"Nice design & fabric, but it's at least a size small."
3.0,Not as pictured. I like the mask but in the picture it appears to flare at the neck. It doesn’t but it is easily worn around the neck so you always have it.
3.0,"I'm 5'7, 186pounds, I wear a large in shirts. I ordered a xl but they sent a 2x ( it fits) but the color is WAY off. I ordered a forest green and got a mix between lime green and regular green."
3.0,"The color is more of a neon than a pastel shown online. I’m still going to wear it, but I’d like it so much more if it was closer to the color shown."
3.0,"This is the cheapest type of jewelry which is usually what the term fashion jewelry means. You are sacrificing quality over quantity but it can be fun to have many different pieces to choose from. You get a little of everything - earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings. Both silver- and goldtone pieces. People with sensitive skin will not be able to wear the earrings. Jewelry like this does not hold up well over time as the metal bends easily and the pieces tend to come unglued. I definitely wouldn't gift these pieces to anyone but only keep for personal use. These pieces are pretty enough for what they are. It all depends on what you are wanting in the way of jewelry."
3.0,I had the necklace on for 2 days .. my friend noticed I had some red bumps on my chest nothing crazy but by the end of the night it got worse .. took the necklace off and I was fine in a few hrs
3.0,Comfy. Nice. Leaked first time I wore.
3.0,Beautiful strap. I did cut off the extra part to make it fit closer to the wrist. The bad it does not seem durable. the leather is forming and starting to stretch after a week. I do not think this will last more than a year.
3.0,The coat looks great and like the picture but it does run a little small. After only a couple days for wearing the coat it has started ripping.
3.0,These &#34;small&#34; glasses are the same size as all the others.  They are not as dark as I would have hoped.
3.0,My husband liked it  but I found the writing to be to small for him and myself we are older people.
3.0,These pendants were a lot bigger than they appeared in the picture. This may not be a problem for someone who like big jewelry but they were way too big.
3.0,"I just received this bracelet and I was thrilled and majorly disappointed within seconds of opening the package. I have a hard time paying more for shipping than the cost of the product (especially with Prime), but the product did arrive within a week. When it arrived I would have to say the quality of the beads is incredible and they are a good weight and the product does not feel cheap.  The problem I have with this product is that the only person this bracelet fits in my house is my 4 year old daughter and it barely fits her.  It only expands a little, and my wife couldn't get it over her hand.  We are pretty normal sized people these bracelets are SMALL.  I keep wishing they added two more beads, they might fit normal human adult hands.  But my daughter now has a skull bracelet added to her dress up collection.  I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review, but after checking back the discount isn't much less than what the bracelets are selling for.  If they made this bigger it would be a 5 star review."
3.0,"These seem to have some very heavy smoke flavoring that will permeate everything, great for chili but kinda weird in ramen or spaghetti sauce. They’re not like the TVP I’m used to, they’re much more like a bac-oh type texture, I’m not sure what kind of fractionated oil products are in here but the flavor kinda eclipses anything they go into. Interesting product but probly would not buy again."
3.0,These are cute. They are padded well on top and have a thick sole. They run small so my daughter's heel stuck out a bit so we were disappointed about that. Definitely consider ordering a size up.
3.0,"Eh. Cute but nothing special. BUT for the price, it's great! Bottom hem is a little odd because it is noticeably longer in the front and back than sides. Could be very flattering for some though! For reference, I'm 5'1&#34;, 115lbs, 32D, and measurements are 33-25-36."
3.0,Tight around the arms.Not a very flattering color scheme; not as subtle as seen.
3.0,Looks great but it is way too small for the average wrist.
3.0,"This dress as a disappointment. The skirt and waist fit nicely but the top was tight around the arms - I am average, not something I typically have an issue with. I decided not order up since the overall look was pretty matronly for a sexy dress - more mother of the groom than guest of wedding in your 30s. The slit is very high but I wasn't concerned about that unless you were planning on dancing aggressively."
3.0,"The dress came just as pictured, accurate color, although somewhat wrinkled but nothing a small steamer couldn’t handle. The dress itself is very well made, has a faux corset built into the bodice and a slip for the bottom. The issue that I have with the dress is that I have small boobs (A cup) and my waist measures 28.5” so that when I try this dress on I can barely get the zipper all the way up, and there is a good amount of space between my boobs and the actual corset part of the dress where my boobs should be. If I were to have chosen a size larger than 8, I would be worried that there would be an even greater space between my chest and the actual corset part of the dress."
3.0,"These leggings we on my Amazon wish list and given to me as a Christmas present (purchased from Amazon by someone else, that's why the sale is not marked as &#34;verified&#34;) ANYWAY, I really love them but I have a problem with one of the leggings. So far I've worn the gray, brown and red leggings and they all fit about the same. I am 5ft 6 and wear a size 6 - 8 in women's pants and the leggings fit comfortably, they might not be completely ankle length for my height/weight. The problem is that I went to put on the black leggings and they are definitely not the same size as the others even though it says &#34;one size fits all&#34;. The black leggings were much shorter and tighter. Also, even though I washed all leggings before wearing them, in my effort to try and pull the black leggings into place while trying to squeeze into them, the dye transferred all over my hands. Once I noticed this I immediately took them off and thankfully my legs and shirt were not affected but I rubbed my hands over the waistband of the leggings again and more dye came off. I am disappointed that I cannot use these black leggings, especially since black is so versatile, but I love the fit and warmth of them so it's a good purchase but just be aware there could be a discrepancy. I hope the blue ones fit."
3.0,The long heart one is backwards on bottom and can’t be fixed
3.0,Didn't fit right. The sleeves were made weird and it didn't fit right in the front.
3.0,"I’m 4’11” and a 28F. This was much too loose around the rib cage band and was returned.<br /><br />The material was okay & the removable cups were also okay.<br /><br />If the top had fit, I would have kept it and it would have become a wardrobe staple."
3.0,This was a cute outfit.  It states size 90 on the tag for 2T.  Not American made. Strings were hanging from shirt when it arrived.  I cut them off and it works
3.0,Love the color and length but the bust area is tight and the buttons are fake.
3.0,Was disappointed to see that the seam was loose. Reordered another. ..same thing. Sent both back. Otherwise  it looked like it would have been  nice.
3.0,black on the buckle started to wear after one use
3.0,Nice bit sure flimsy chain
3.0,fairly well made but had to add inserts to make them comfortable
3.0,It fits nicely. It makes me look slim around the mid section.
3.0,Nice hoodie but runs somewhat small
3.0,These earrings look rather fake.<br />Maybe in dim lighting you can get away  with wearing these.
3.0,My son loves this necklace but the charm keeps coming off.
3.0,"got a hole in them during first wearing, but not defective material"
3.0,I thought this item was OK but nothing to really make me over the moon . It was smaller than I thought but well made just average as purchases go .
3.0,I wish that they were made of thicker material.  They would be more comfortable.  They feel tight around my toes.
3.0,the fitting is excellent.<br /><br />The only problem is the dress fades...loses colour as soon as it's washed. Ends up looking like a very very old dress.
3.0,"I ordered a 2X...but the top was lose/very low cut, while the waist down was to tight. I wear a 16 in jeans, and I have a 38DDD butt. The material is somewhat thick...but the stitching around the neck looks kinda cheap."
3.0,"I love the print, but was disappointed that it didn't continue all around the shirt to the back. Especially since it's a more sheer, silky fabric which shows my usual black bra underneath. A little more loose/wide fitting than expected also, but I am a very slender person. Overall a good purchase for the money."
3.0,They don’t clasp well.  The clasp will bend and not go into the hole as it should.
3.0,Zipper is very tough to use
3.0,"I ordered wide fit for this shoe.  I have the bryars in a wide and they fit comfortably.  However, with this shoe i can not wear heavier socks / dress socks ok but heavier socks make them too tight.  Maybe once they stretch out, they will be more comfortable. but overall ok shoes."
3.0,"Pretty good quality, doesn't bend at all."
3.0,"I wear a size 18 and ordered a 2x, which fit perfectly. I like the fit and think it's flattering for my body type. I cut the sleeves off of mine and wore it with a shrug, this one in particular (which is awesome).... https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ASDR52. I had two issues with this dress. There was a part where the top and bottom are sewn together, but the thread didn't catch in a spot about two inches wide and the fabric was loose. I had to use fabric glue to fix it temporarily until I can sew it. The second issue is that there are two pleats in the front and one of the pleats is way off to one side. It is noticeable. Luckily, I wore this in a dark nightclub. Had I realized these issues before I cut the sleeves off, I would've returned it. I do like the dress however, and may order it in other colors in hopes that there aren't any major issues and I will be sure to check this time before I cut the sleeves off. This is my second purchase from this brand. The first dress I bought from them was wonderful and had no issues."
3.0,"Felt a little tight on my head, but I tend to run a bit large anyways, so I usually bend metal wire glasses to make them more comfortable. What disappointed me is the white trim around the lenses (on the green lens pair). It's near impossible to see in the product photos in the white background. I ended up giving them to my wife because the white trim isn't really my style"
3.0,Way small. Pity because the dress is well made and I really like it. Dress shoes flower but it was so small it was like a bodycon.
3.0,"These socks are not exactly as advertised on the website.  These are funny meme crazy socks but I thought it was because of the colors.<br /><br />There are several differences in the socks I received and what they look like on amazon.<br />1.  The pink color is a very bold pink.  The picture looks like a dull pink.<br />2.  The picture shows a blue area below the top of the sock.  There is a blank blue area on one side of each sock.  BUT  on the other side of the sock, there is a saying and a car in my blue area.  The saying...""I just wanna hany with DOG"" .  A person and a dog are hanging out of the car windows.  And no, I did not misspell the word hang....HANY is spelled out in black on my socks.  Is this correct???<br /><br />These socks are imported from China.  This may be the reason for the misspelling or maybe I am missing some point here.<br />The socks are  80% Cotton, 17% Polyester, 3% Spandex.<br />Apparently these are one size fits most.  These will fit fine on my wife but I could wear these as they are to small.<br />The socks are soft and I think they would be comfortable.<br />There is no current price so I do not know if these are a good buy or not.  I would like to know it they intended the sock to say "" HANY"" or if it was a misspelling."
3.0,Great material but it was too small. I am 5'4 160 lbs. and medium are a'ways perfect or slightly loose but this was too small it fit but you could tell it was tight
3.0,gave these to my daughter - TEEN sizing - not womens
3.0,"These are nice, but as soon as they are washed they look worn out."
3.0,"The leather  of this boot is very soft and made of good quality; however, the design of the boot is too short for US size standards.  I bought three pairs and had to return all of them."
3.0,Ordered a large because I’m curvy and it still seems a little smaller than I want. Material isn’t the best but you get what you pay for. Nice summer dress to have on hand though.
3.0,"I was worried about the quality of these because of the price but, as soon as I received them, that worry went away. they are extremely durable and look exactly like they did in the picture. I have received tons of compliments on them. If you have a thicker neck, as I do, you might want to think about purchasing a necklace extender. These do run a bit tight."
3.0,"Super cute and retro fit great I am 5'7, 210 lbs apple shaped DDD42, after about 5 washed it loses its appeal and little balls form. But feels amazing before that."
3.0,Broke from clasp first day repaired twice now is good
3.0,"In reference to other pictures and comments, I also received the ugly psychotic cat ring. For the price, they aren't too cheaply made and the Psycho looking cat actually represents my niece's crazy cat. The other thing to mention is sizing, the description says for girls and woman, unless your girl is adult size, the cat ears ring is the only one that will close enough to fit properly on an eleven year old."
3.0,Cute dress but had to return.  It wasn't as flowy as the pic and the pockets stuck out right in the hip area which is not flattering.
3.0,"These products are fun and comfortable but the fabric pulled after the first wear and wash, particularly on the heel."
3.0,"it does not look like the picture. the colors are washed out, you almost can't see the yellow stripe."
3.0,Bought this as an accessory to a comic com outfit. Loved the purse itself and the design. Unfortunately the clips on the strap kept coming undone.
3.0,Cute outfit but top runs small
3.0,"I like how the material feels, but I do sweat a lot with this jacket, it feels lightweight but doesn't keep you cool. I love that it offers protection. I only wear it if I know I will be out a long time, and the price is good for what you get. But if the weather is hot you will be too in this jacket."
3.0,"Rcvd the outfit today. My daughter is 27lbs/20 months, little tall for her age. Shirt is too wide for her shoulders & bloomers are huge. Hopefully when I was them they will shrink. But definatly worth it."
3.0,"This dress was well sewn and fit well in all the right places...the shoulders, bust, waist, and the length was perfect. What I tousled with was the underlying lighter colored fabric, which showed through the top open pattern of the dress. The contrast made the dress look cheap. Had it been the same color, it would have been a keeper. Sadly, I returned the dress."
3.0,"I was expecting the umbrella to be light weight, but it feels heavy when I am holding it.  I'm looking for an automatically open and close umbrella however it doesn't retract.  The handle was greasy with some mechanical oil and smells bad.  Not sure if I will keep it..."
3.0,"They were alright.  1 of the gloves thumb hole is basically non usable, can't seem to get the thumb in there.  Looked at the glove, couldn't figure if it's the angle of the gloves thumb or what.  But not the best gloves I've purchased"
3.0,The sweater fits nicely but the color seems to be off--more of a rust color.  Thought it was more of a pink.
3.0,It's really nice but my I have a large waist and bust so was a bit tight around there. Do not buy if you have big hips.
3.0,Too big. How do I return it?
3.0,"One of the main selling points of this watch was that there is supposed to be minimal stainless steel contact with your wrist, but the metal latch inside the wristband is 1 1/2 inches long when closed and on the wrist.  This watchband is also only somewhat adjustable and will be loose on smaller wrists.  I would t recommend for anyone with a thin frame."
3.0,"Super cute in the picture! But when I got it it wasn’t all that great, the lace was itchy, very itchy but I love shoe it looked on my skin so I thought I could look past it. the rest of the shirt is made it of a thicker material for a shirt, which was soft but it was weird looking. going to have to return, so sad because I love the idea of this top!"
3.0,The product is too small in the front to really cover you. You wouldn’t want to do anything athletic for fear of this top lifting up!
3.0,HUGE is an understatement. Cute though
3.0,The L.O.L style and pedometer were the main reasons for getting this one. She wanted to measure her steps. The style was cute. The pedometer did not work.
3.0,"This is a great cap if it fits your head.  Unfortunately, it didn't fit my x-small head."
3.0,Cute! But a little big
3.0,"The material is heavy, almost &#34;scratchy&#34;, I did not like that the bottom of the blouse did not stretch and was form fitting (not a good cut if you are a pear shape)."
3.0,"I was buying this to go with a wonder woman shirt.  It was too tight for my medium adult head.  I don't like things tight.  So it may be great for kids, but my 8 year old said it was tight after a while.  I read other reviews and before using I sewed the glued elastic to reinforce it.  My kids haven't played with it since (but they will when they need accessories for superheros), so I'm not sure if it made a difference."
3.0,"I am 5’8” and 200 lbs and got the XXL and it fits pretty snug around my hips. I’m curvy and it fit snug in all areas. Has pockets though! :) It fits height wise pretty good. Ankle cuffs hit right at the ankle so if I was any shorter it would be long on me. Haven’t tested any glow capabilities yet. Zipper zips all the way up to cover your face with eye holes if you want a skeleton face mask also. Fabric is pretty rough, not soft at all like pj’s but more an actual costume that is made from all very synthetic materials and would be hot on a warm day."
3.0,"I’m going to keep these but only because I’m sick of returning pants that don’t live up to what I wanted.  I kept increasing the price I was willing to pay for what ostensibly looked like the same exact pants, and I wasn’t wrong. They are the same pants just more expensive.  I’m 120 pounds 5‘3“ and the small fits perfect.  Not too loose not too tight.  It feels like I’m wearing crêpe paper.  I can only hope that a wash will help with that but of course once I wash them that’s it and they are really mine.  Lol.  They are lightweight and they do fit well, and the light beige color I wanted is a tiny bit see-through, but not so much nude underwear won’t solve the problem."
3.0,They were a gift and she said they were gorgeous and she loves them.My only problem is they took 2 months to get here.
3.0,Great concept but I can't get the hair tie to stay on the bracelet.
3.0,the shoes are very narrow so if you have a wide foot like my son they won't fit. Other than that they seem to a good value for the money
3.0,Cool bracelet but the charms always faced the wrong way and it was really long
3.0,"I loved the pictures of this coat, that being said the xxl was more like a medium, also it came vacuum packed which means that you can't really wear it till you steam out the wrinkles.<br />The price was good but it barely matters if it doesn't fit."
3.0,ripped pretty quickly but it was ok<br />easy to install and effective before it broke
3.0,"The blue mask is awesome! Unfortunately, the red mask is kinda dim; unless you're in nearly total darkness, it's hard to see the lights on it.<br />I'm not sure if the mask is designed that way, or if I just got a defective/damaged one, but I'm disappointed in the red mask nonetheless."
3.0,"While this is cute and fits well it is not at all a sweater, not even a light weight sweatshirt material. I would describe it as more of a heavy tee-shirt material. I think it would be great for spring or summer, but definitely not for fall or winter. It is a good length, mid thing and covers your bottom well, it has cuffs on the sleeves that I think add to it's over all style too. The other problem I had with this is it came vacuum packed and even after washing and drying it was still a bit wrinkled so you would have to iron it. There is no lining, like I said just a heavy tee-shirt material. The picture looked more like a light sweat shirt. I will save it for spring time."
3.0,"Forgot to remove my ring when I applied  hand sanitizer  to my hands,<br />So disappointed, some of the decals on my peace ring ,<br />Came off... I was so bummed out,  Cause it is a Very Cool ring."
3.0,It says M but it came as L. I really wanted to keep this dress. Good quality and stylish!
3.0,"Good quality, but too heavy in my already over-filled purse. Also, the small button release is hard on weak hands."
3.0,"As I informed the seller, the goggles needed a soft rubber or material at the bridge of the nose. The hard plastic at that point--the bridge--is sharp and very uncomfortable to wear. I gave it a three because the nose clip and the eye pieces are good, but personally I wouldn't purchase another pair until they find a way to correct the one flaw."
3.0,"The hip is wider than I expected.. The material is not what is shown on the website . I was going to return it because it is not suitable for the purpose i bought it for, but I am keeping it because I can wear it to church."
3.0,I thought it would be a cotton material. its more polyester/nylon.. pretty color though
3.0,"Belt is ok for a cheap leather belt. The size is not accurate at all. I have size 44 leather belts and this size 48 belt is only one inch longer. From the buckle to the left negative hole. So, better order about three sizes more than what you want."
3.0,They run way too big
3.0,"I am 5 ft and 130 lbs. this top is a beautiful but very sheer top. I bought the yellow. The material is flowy and seems durable.  The shirt goes just to the bottom of my hip bones. The sleeves are very long but, I am a small woman and this is a common problem for me. The design is lovely however, the front lays very strange on me. It is tight around the bust and since there is no stretch it wrinkles up funny. I am not sure if it is the design or my body shape. Perhaps when I get fit this will lay differently. The material does wrinkle easily."
3.0,I couldn’t squeeze it enough to fit my daughters wrist. I thought I’d be able to adjust it at least a bit.
3.0,It was a very bad storm in San Francisco Ca I used for few minutes and broke. I’m so sad because I can’t afford to get a new one.
3.0,Very cheap.  Not really worth what little money I spent on it.  It did OK in a pinch.
3.0,Definitely recommend buying a size up. Sleeves are short.
3.0,"The shirts quality was what you would expect for the price; however it was the sizing was WAY off. My XXL fit more like a large. My other XXL Slim fit shirts are loose on me, I couldn't even button this one."
3.0,There is a white lining in this outfit that does not match the length of the shorts. The outside fabric is so see thru that it looks stupid and cheap.
3.0,I didn’t appreciate that the images/pictures on the lanyard appliqué-like plastic. They will likely flake off over time and it just looks cheap. I’m glad I also purchased another brand on here that was a similar price because it’s way better.
3.0,Cute dress but runs super small. I usually wear a small and ordered a medium. The medium was so tight I had to struggle to get on. Once on it was just too tight to be comfortable. I had to return. Very nice looking dress though. I would have really liked if it had fit.
3.0,cocentration
3.0,I wish this were longer through the torso but it’s wearable.
3.0,The light is useless.<br />I'm a big guy and the band would only fit my wrist on the last hole.<br />Way to tight for me.<br />Small...looks like a women's watch.<br />Great if you're 12 years old and want a first watch.
3.0,"The 3rd time I wore my golf shoes, few cleats fell off. Not to happy"
3.0,First let me say its a pretty necklace but it didn't glow like the picture.
3.0,These earrings are cute but one of the earrings were deformed and discolored and they placed the hook in a way where the discoloration and deformity would be displayed when i wore the earrings.  Maybe they sent it on accident but i couldn't wear it.  It was sent back and a refund was issued  I have purchased other nice products from this seller so I'm not sure what happened.  However i did not like this product enough to order it again.
3.0,Hard to push onto the glasses which is good and bad.  Hopefully it means they will not fall off.  Pain to set up though.
3.0,"I have a feeling these are knock offs as the soles have two different shades of white on them and (as an artists myself that hand paints old sneakers... it's weird I know), there looks to be a paint over job on the one sole with a brighter white then the other.  I hate dealing with Amazon sellers sometimes because you never know what your're going to get."
3.0,I returned the dress because it was not really flattering.
3.0,"It's not quite as chunky and big as pictured but, it's still really cute."
3.0,"Really cute, BUT ITS LITERALLY $5 AT PARTY CITY!!! Don't buy it for more! Antlers not as tall or wide set as they appear in pictures."
3.0,La tela no es de la mejor calidad.<br />Viene muy largo.
3.0,The colour didn't match it is more turquise rather green. The dress arrived with defect torn under the sholder. Not please with the purchase.
3.0,"The watermelon color is spot on! Its really beautiful. However, it reeks like the worst BO ever! I am confident that airing it out wont be enough. Hopefully it will come out upon washing. I understand that sometimes things have a chemical smell until washed, but I cannot understand why this scarf smells absolutely disgusting! It is very delicate, also, so I’m not so sure how well it will hold up to washes. Not sure if its a keeper."
3.0,"For 10 dollars, I can tell time without looking at my cell phone :-)  Casio watch is functional.  So far, so good.  Wrist band should be a little longer, though (people with thick wrists may have a problem with this model)."
3.0,The yoga capri leggings are more like tights however served its purpose under a shirt dress.  Good color. Next size would have been better.
3.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this hat! I’ve seen them look so cute on people on social media, and I thought it would be perfect for me because I live in Hawaii. Sadly, NO. Just no. Wayyyyy too tight. >.&lt; It did not work at all. So bummed! Sent it back. :/"
3.0,Some was to thin and broke trying to adjust.
3.0,Shrink after one wash. Very comfortable
3.0,It's a pretty dress but little too small for me so I gave it to my sister.
3.0,Smaller than expected! The pattern is more distinct than pictured.
3.0,I ordered these for my preschool-aged daughter to wear under dresses at school. They are super thin and see through but they worked for wearing under a dress. I wouldn't let her wear them as shorts alone to gymnastics or anything bc you can see her undies underneath.
3.0,"fits well, but you can see the outline of underwear through it, so i need to wear black bike shorts over it if i want to wear it out."
3.0,"I was so so excited to get these leggings, it seemed like everyone was raving about them. When I received my pair today I immediately tried them on and they were too big! This wouldn’t sound frustrating but after reading through so many reviews and following the sizing chart I was debating between S and M. I’m 5’3” 130 lbs and ultimately went with small despite the size chart telling me to go with medium. I know these have potential to be 5 star leggings but the fit is just way too off for me. Maybe I’ll try an x-small"
3.0,Model makes it look better than it does.
3.0,"The backs were too small for the posts,I broke two earnings  trying to force it to fit"
3.0,Use for urine leaks. Don’t like high cut in front. A little pricey.
3.0,"pretty dress, the cut is weird"
3.0,I bought this skirt and returned it due to it being too large. It is cute but the hearts are just screen printed on. The pleats are crisp and the fabric seemed fine.
3.0,"Not shawls, these are chiffon (thin) scarves.  Nice size on the leopard scarf but the zebra scarf was shorter. still good deal for the price"
3.0,This item runs a little too large for the size
3.0,"These run small! I by no means have a large head, but they are tight! and they don't feel good."
3.0,It is really cute but there is a lot of extra material and its really short
3.0,"The shoe looks good and I ordered it because it said it had a wide toe box.  I wear a wide width shoe and it is nearly impossible to find a wide width court shoe for squash or racquetball.  The shoe was not advertised as wide width so I ordered a larger size than I usually wear hoping the wide toe box would work for me.  The shoe was too long and still was snug in the width.  If you have a narrow or average foot this shoe could be a good value for you, but if you wear a wide width don't count on the wide toe box being wide enough.  I had to return it."
3.0,I usually wear a medium/large. I like my robes to benkne size larger. However the XL was actually was too big. Very soft and loved how it looked. Just know it is going to be bigger than the normal size you order.
3.0,"These are fine as far as no show and no slip, but the material is so synthetic feeling, I can barely stand to wear them."
3.0,"I thought it would be a dark blue, but it was black."
3.0,Good larger size for a 3yr old... sleeves a little tight. Poor quality (material and how it's sewed together)... don't plan to wear more than once or twice.
3.0,The earrings are cute and sturdy but they cannot be use for cartilage piercing because the stud is to wide for the piercing.
3.0,It shows a little the bottom whenever it been down but thank you though I had to cover it up put some tight spandex on it
3.0,Not nearly as comfy as I had hoped.
3.0,Returned -didn’t fit but nice
3.0,Adorable not too durable though last about 4months then the leather cracks and fades if it's in and out of pockets.
3.0,This ring looks cheap.
3.0,"When I received the watch, it was amazing to look at. When I tried to take the links out, there was no tool to adjust them but luckily i had one from the band that i had purchased for myself. Once i was able to open the small clips that hold each link on, i had my fiancee try it on. Unfortunately 1 link too many was way to big, 1 link less was way too small where she can not get it onto her wrist due to not having a clasp full size clasp.  There needs to be an micro adjuster and normal opening/closing clasp like they have on normal bands. I'm now needing to take it to a jewelry store to see if they can do anything to help."
3.0,"Really thin, wouldn't order again."
3.0,Too big. Fits a mans face well but does not work on a petite face
3.0,"These were super cute when I first opened them, I noticed a button at the bottom was missing but I still wore them, when wearing them the seam down the middle poped I think my thighs were too big (I’m curvy) but I still rocked them"
3.0,I like the jersey but it's way too big.
3.0,"Well it's been a month and its withstand every bump,drop, and hit. It's withstood every impact. Only thing I don't like about it is that the color is starting to fade into a silver. Aside from that its my daily watch band."
3.0,these are still fairly small and hard to get on
3.0,"Shirt was extremely too big to wear. Is definitely a nice shirt but runs pretty big. Since its too big to wear, its just going to be a wall shirt for my Steelers room."
3.0,"Very cute ,like picture shows sizing is off - too big. Tag says dry cleaning recommended, who dry cleans toddlers clothing?- may have to return it."
3.0,I have ordered these shoes several times now and I never get the right size. I'm really disappointed about that. I love that they are narrow but never the right size in the length.
3.0,"I ordered these for my 8y/o that is allergic to all the others and I need to keep an eye on her piercings.  These are baby-sized, way too small for even an 8 y/o"
3.0,Very very long. Description stated midi length but this hits the floor and then some. Going to hem it but not as described.
3.0,very cute it could have been perfect for my white party but had to go back very see through<br />i got a large size so it will fit loose but that didn't help fabric is not best quality in the dark color i think it would be better.
3.0,"Quality is great, but It will fit you only if your head size is like watermelon."
3.0,I really love the bracelet. Its beautiful. I picked it because it reminds me of my recently deceased husband.<br />But I wore it for 3 days when the strings broke. Now I have no way to keep it on.
3.0,Great for visiblity/seeing and pretty comfortable.  Only draw back is it drains a lot of water down side of face when swimming freestyle
3.0,Love the style of the shirt but I ordered a wine color and got a super bright red color.  I thought it was a mistake and they had sent me the wrong color but there is no red.  Confusing but I kept it anyway!  Product could be a 5 star (yet to be determined after washing and wearing) but I was hoping for the color as shown.  I also ordered the water blue one and the color was exactly as shown
3.0,"I received a smaller size then what I initially ordered but they fit, just not much room to grow with. Soft and keep my sons feet warm."
3.0,"These are a nice pair of gloves with a cute faux leather detailing at the wrists, but the touch screen aspect did not work for me.  Instead of banging away on my phone screen and not going anywhere, it was simpler to just take them off.  I decided to keep them anyway because they fit my hand perfectly, just not the touch part."
3.0,Just applied it hoping it does the job been walking around with them for a full day pretty sure its helping break them in
3.0,"I really love the look of these bracelets, however, if you are looking for stackable bracelets, they can look messy when you wear several at once. My wrists are small so the two ends stick out really far (the end pieces you pull to make it tighter). They tend to turn around on your wrist and the ends start sticking up every which way and then it just looks super messy. They would surly be 5 stars if they used the kind of knots a lot of other bracelets use that don't have ends sticking out. For that reason I generally only wear one or two, which defeats the entire purpose of why I bought them (to stack)."
3.0,I thought these would have been better especially for the price.
3.0,"Love this purse, however it is already starting to come apart. So w of the stitching is coming loose and the zippers are cheap."
3.0,"Interesting look, but quality is not great.."
3.0,fold marks wont come out
3.0,"Seemed to be good quality, but the eyeholes are small so it’s hard to see in the dark and there aren’t enough air holes so you can’t wear it for too long."
3.0,Didn’t like the fabric type.
3.0,"While these are pretty, they are not as big as they appear to be and are frail. I would not have ordered these if I'd seen them as they are!"
3.0,Quality is okay. I ordered a size up because I expected it to be small. Still too small. Maybe should have ordered 2sizes up. Not happy with this product.
3.0,Beautiful hat but way too small for a 10 year old.
3.0,"It seems like this company is known for making custom fit goggles.  Which is great, but expensive.  So this version is designed to be a generic fit unit that offers some of the other benefits.  The information included said that this particular design should fit well for 30% of users, and I am definitely in the 70% category.  There is too much pressure on my eye socket and it simply isn't comfortable.  Its unfortunately because the goggles themselves are very nice.  You have much better vision than speedos and it doesn't fog up nearly as much as my old goggles.  But since the goggles are not comfortable for me, I won't be using them.  I would say that they would be a killer buy for anyone in the 30% category for fit."
3.0,Not what I expected.  Would purchase again
3.0,I got a few Barbels in with missing jewels. That’s not what I paid for. But I guess 2 out of 6 ain’t bad. Even though the ones with missing jewels were the main reason I chose to buy😑
3.0,"looks good but a heavy heavy hat. made of heavy vinyl, not cotton. would not suggest wearing in hot temperatures. back is a hook and loop adjustment easy to adjust to proper size."
3.0,"The sizing chart is not accurate.  I ordered my regular size, but these were too small.  They have a comfortable, cushioned sole, so I would order one size up."
3.0,"Updated 9/24/ 2017- after giving my original 2 star review I received a surprise package in the mail. A new pair of the exact shoes I had ordered and reviewed. I hadn't asked for nor did I expect to get a replacement pair. Good customer service deserves an extra star. Thanks for the replacement.<br />Super cute, the child I bought them for just loved them, however after wearing them 2 times the metal ring for the strap came off. Very disappointing."
3.0,"Waist size and the length was good... But the overall fit was much to roomy. My husband is not slim in any area, but there was just too much slack in the groin, butt area and legs."
3.0,"The reason I thought this top is due to my skin condition where an elastic band of a bra causes heat blisters.  Although a flattering top and made of a nice material, the built in bra strap is not encased in the fabric but rather bare to touch the skin inside. I had to return."
3.0,"I ordered a M/red blouse and received and M/red dress.  I hate being bothered with returns so I'm keeping it. It's well made, and I will get some use out of it."
3.0,Comfortable and cute. But got pilly after the 2nd use. Not sure how else to have prevented that.
3.0,"I had high hopes for this top, but it just ended up being ok.  I love the color!  The material is really silky and felt nice and the v neck wasn't as deep as it looks in the picture so, even though I have a large chest (32I), it isn't too sexy for work.  It's a bit too small for me in the chest (like, a good portion of my bra is exposed by the armholes), but is very large and boxy around my waist.  It's also pretty long (I'm 5'5"" and it's long enough that I could wear it with leggings).  Wearing a jacket or a cami underneath can fix the issue with my bra at the armholes, but I have to have it altered to fix the length and suspect I'll have to live with the boxiness."
3.0,The material is hard to describe. I'm use to shift dresses being super light weight..the color is also off. It's not terrible..but just not what I expected
3.0,When. You. Put them in dryer. They burn on. Bottom
3.0,"Things I like, length, color, style<br /><br />Things I don't like sizing it is way off no give in the waist.<br /><br />Things I can live with material there was no smell from mine<br /><br />I recommend ordering up at least two sizes"
3.0,"Very pretty, though the center Jewel was askew. The chain was also much shorter than it should have been. I wear it occasionally and it seems to hold up."
3.0,"These run so small I ordered the biggest size and they say they are supposed to fit waist size: 31.10"" - 41.34"". OK fine they fit my waist but they hug my thighs and my crotch so bad that you get a camel toe the size of the gran canyon.<br /><br />If you are a Rey looking for pants these will do you well once dyed the right color, they are soft and flowly but if you where a 14/16 in pants. Forget it."
3.0,Far too small/tiny. Most disappointing!!
3.0,"These are cute, but not &#34;skinny jeans&#34; as the description claims. They fit in the waist, but the legs definitely fit more like a boyfriend jean. I was disappointed in this fit since it wasn't the look I was going for when I ordered, and I would not have ordered them if I had known how large the legs would be. On the plus side, they are super comfy (lots of stretch)."
3.0,"I am a new purchaser to this brand. In the picture the model is petite. ( Asian) . , the item fits her as a dress. I am an true size ( American). , item fits me as a top.<br /><br />I believe this item is from China. I say all that to say . I actually like the item. I ordered larger but could have ordered a size down.<br /><br />It will look great with leggings and ankle boots. The material is great and the 3-D flowers are beautiful. I will order from them again now that I have figured out the size scale.<br /><br />The sizes run plus so if you wear a 3x you can probably get away with a 2x so forth and so on👍🏽"
3.0,"Don't expect these to last long, even a whole summer, but they are inexpensive and fine for swim lessons or beach. My kids really liked the choices in colors and patterns, so they enjoyed wearing them.  As other reviewers have said, the sizing is wonky!"
3.0,"Very cute, was a pleasant surprise even though it said two pieces I didn't realize it ment two full bracelets! The one I have worn for a week has faded a little not so pink anymore but it's still pretty!"
3.0,"These are cute like the picture, but when you first get them, the TARDIS images are all stuck together. Takes quite a bit of work to separate them. After washing, that problem seems to be mostly solved."
3.0,I was decolorized very fast
3.0,"I love the cut, design and color, but quality is poor; waist is too tight for one size fit."
3.0,2 small around the neckline and chest area
3.0,"I ordered a size large due to the size chart and I can’t get this buttoned. I am a size 36 DD, and this is a no go. Kind of upsetting since I was excited for this. The material is super soft and I plan on gifting this so it’s not a total loss. It’s very pretty!"
3.0,"Maybe we're just not the sort of people that can pull off this style, but my wife has worn sun hats before that looked nice. This one just looks goofy when she tried it on. We also tried it on my teenaged daughter as well as some of my younger daughters and it honestly just doesn't look good on anyone in my household!<br />Is it functional? It sure is! It fits well, folds well, and is comfortable to wear and will block the sun and protect your skin. But it won't look stylish when you do it... or at least it didn't for us. I could imagine others liking it, but honestly no one in my house wants to go outside wearing it."
3.0,"The glasses came in and looked fine. They serve their purpose as far as look and use, but the quality could be better and just the overall feel to them isn't as comfortable or durable for the type of glasses they are."
3.0,I like the style and how cute it looks but one of the screws came undone and popped off in the first week and it will not stay on :(
3.0,the chain easily broke after little use
3.0,"I bought 5 different kinds of compression socks on Amazon. Compression wise, this is not as good as Physix Gear Sport socks, where you really feel the tightness massaging your calf. The compression of Nurse Mates is closer to tight knee socks than actual compression socks. It looks nice though. Physix has the best compression among the five although it's a bit pricey."
3.0,"They look great, but I had to re-sow them three times. They ripped at different times on each panel on the backside.  I would squat and they would rip horribly. And I’m a real skinny guy."
3.0,"If you have boobs don't buy this dress.  I ordered a xxl, I am between an xl and XXL so went larger just in case but the sizes run about 2 sizes too small as well. I ordered 4 different dresses all in XXL and this is the only one that was too small.  Other than that the dress is cute."
3.0,The dress is fine but the fabric underneath is a bit golden and I didn’t like that. Also if you wash it it probably will look pretty bad...<br /><br />I would say its not worth it.
3.0,The shorts don’t fit well for me between my legs. After one wear in class and I was totally uncomfortable in them I had to immediately remove them. Not sure how it would fit on others but mine didn’t fit well. The padding did help in cycling class but once I got off the bike I wa very uncomfortable.
3.0,Mine broke too soon.
3.0,The quality of the product was good. The sticker where St Christopher is placed was off a bit on one I bought. The second one I bought was off too and I&#34;m going to have to use an exact-o knife to cut there it doesn't fit in the frame. It might be my boyfriend's car but I wish it was a bit longer too.
3.0,Be aware that the red color is more maroon than red. Stitching is poorly done. Fabric is cotton so expect it to wrinkle easily. I can make my own clothes so i know when the item is badly made or not. If you can live with this then u can dress it up and down as u wish. Good for one time events but dont expect to hold up after being laundered
3.0,Están muy bonitos pero un poco grandes
3.0,Color is pretty and material is decent for the price but definitely not a workout legging. Not squat proof at all. Will be for wearing around the house only.
3.0,Super sexy and fit well except for the hanging strings.  I'm planning on trying it real tight when I wear it next week and then cutting them off.  Too distracting and silly looking!<br /><br />Otherwise the dress is great.  Material is a bit thicker than I expected but very flattering if you aren't petite like me with the ruching all over.
3.0,"Loved it! Until the chain broke out of nowhere like, 2 months after I received it."
3.0,"I have another pair of these earrings in a different size.  I like them so I thought I'd order another pair in a larger size.  My mistake.  This pair that I received is not as well-made.  The post is not in the center of one of the earrings and so it hangs in a different place on my earlobe than the other one.  Also, my ear is irritated by the metal and I'm having to turn the earring with an application of alcohol in order to keep the ear from getting infected.  I'm very disappointed.  Have not returned them because I wore them before seeing the flaws in the earring."
3.0,These earrings are HUGE!  They also look cheap.
3.0,They look super cute but I just wore it once and it broken down so if you want it for a day or two it's ok.
3.0,Not real happy with saddles I had to by another type
3.0,"Good for the money. Slightly disappointed when I went to put one on and realized the clasps were completely missing from one side. 🤔 Luckily, it was a 6 pack."
3.0,"I really liked the glasses, but one of the arms broke after a few months of use. I taped it and am still using them, but expected them to last longer."
3.0,"So, the bands themselves are okay. The buckle is cheaper plastic & a few of the bands are harder to buckle than the others. The holes on the off brand bands are a tiny bit smaller but would be great if point half of them weren't harder to buckle.<br /><br />The colors are varied enough for my needs, but certainly not appropriate for a more formal affair.<br /><br />The ""free screen protectors"" aren't for me. The directions are hard to understand and I've applied plenty of off-brand screen protectors before. I dont like the yellow tinge. Perhaps ill update the review of the bands after a few months of usage."
3.0,The bike tarnished after just a few wears.
3.0,"The band is exactly what you would expect for $15.00, but taking a link out for sizing is challenging.  It took many tries and lots of strength to move the pins."
3.0,Cute suit The boy shorts are a little short from waste to inseam
3.0,"It just looks like it had already been washed several times and the paint beginning to fade. I will likely not purchase clothing online any more, it always is less than expected"
3.0,Wish the ball was smaller
3.0,I have a hard time finding swimming suits since I have rather large boobs and a small waist. I thought this would be a good option to get support and coverage without looking like I'm wearing a tent. But even at an XL I have major side boob unless I tuck the girls in to get underboob instead. I just wish the bra was wide enough to actually fix XL boobs. It does have padding in it though that a lot of the cheaper options don't give you.<br /> I get a lot of compliments on it and don't need to wear a cover up when out in public since it is fashionable. So that's a perk.
3.0,"I'm a size 8, usually a Reg, but I ordered a LG. The waist is at least 4&#34; above the natural waistline, the bustling goes right under my armpits, and the armholes are uncomfortable."
3.0,"I really thought I'd like a rolling computer bag but I'm finding it's not what I expected. The straps are too short to really carry the bag on my shoulder when I don't want to roll it. I also have to watch where I'm rolling it because I generally put my bag on my front seat. If I don't want icky stuff all over my seat, I have to pick up the bag which defeats the purpose of having wheels. The bag will stay wide open if you don't zip it, which I don't like.<br /><br />It fits under the airline seats but the straps don't necessarily fit so they stick out under my feet. It's a hard leather so it does not bend. I'm still using it...6 months in because I spent good money on it but if I had it to do over I would have gone with a softer material with larger shoulder straps."
3.0,It's ok but took forever to get to me
3.0,"A little too bright, but my son likes them."
3.0,Wore once and got many compliments - sadly a seam tore in the shoulder and the fabric is not easily reparable.  Disappointed!
3.0,"Cute and soft, but only okay quality. Not too terribly impressed, but also no major faults or flaws."
3.0,"At first I really loved this wallet, it fit all of my necessities and my iPhone 8 with an otter box case.  BUT only a few weeks in to using it and the zipper started to go bad.  Now it’s a struggle to close it and sometimes the zipper busts open after closing.  The teeth in the zipper seem flimsy and bend too easily - making the connection fail.  And that’s without my phone inside - so it’s not an overfilling issue.  The pattern is cute but I wouldn’t purchase again and would have returned it if the zipper issue had happened in the time frame to return."
3.0,Sizes are not true to fit!
3.0,"I have a hard time with these &#34;new materials&#34; I love pure cotton which is getting harder to find. This is well made, but so thin, it's pretty much totally form clinging. It'll be great for summer and hot flash season, I ordered it a little too late in the season. But it is well made. I'd like a little more thickness to the material."
3.0,"This blouse was okay,  the sleeves wasn't as sheer as they look in the picture and there was a lot of material in the front, it hung down a little to low but it's a nice blouse to wear to work."
3.0,"Not the best material, but pretty"
3.0,Cute but kinda big. I’m 5’ 4” and 135 lbs.
3.0,Very lightweight. Almost plasticy. Not a bad purchase though for the price. I tried it on with my watch but have not given it a test spin by wearing it out yet.
3.0,The material used in this jacket is easy to scratch and very sensitive. I only used it once and washed.
3.0,Only wore it twice. Wasn’t comfortable
3.0,"It would have been much better if the zipper zipped 2-way, especially for a ""Convertable"". Strange material, does not seem like a windbreaker, nor does it have much water resistance. Good color. Like all the pockets. Adjustable hood is nice."
3.0,Bought xxl. Fits like large. Gave away
3.0,The band fell apart upon opening! Watch is adorable but I had to buy a new band for the gift recipient!
3.0,The color is great but I don't like the knit fabric the dress is made of.  Flimsy.
3.0,"Measurements aren't accurate, as the case is said to be 1.77 inches and it's way wider than that, closer to 2.5in. The color is more copper than shown as well. It also comes without instructions on how to adjust the time, so I'm lost there.<br />That's the cons, but the pros are that it is still nicely made and (as big as it is) feels very durable. Not sure if I'll keep it as I want it for daily use and it just might be too clunky. They just need more accurate stats for this, as it's overall a good product."
3.0,Product does not work for me personally.
3.0,"It looks cute, but feels bit larger."
3.0,Had it on just 1 week and it turned.
3.0,"Made this purchase as a gift.  The wallet is a great design with the metal mandalorian symbol.  It has a covered see through spot for an ID or drivers license. It can hold several other credit cards.  The material is a medium grade.  The person whom  I gave the wallet, had a wallet with the same design and it lasted 1 1/2 yrs with everyday use."
3.0,"Flimsy material, one side ripped while trying to slide it onto the glasses. Still used for a while until it ripped the rest of the way. Cost was cheap though so....... you get what you pay for. I'd go Oakley brand next time! which is actually what I'm getting ready to do. ;)"
3.0,"It’s really cute and seems well made , I’m keeping it so my daughter can grow into hopefully next summer but I would not describe this as a 4t/5t, my daughter is tall and lean so I know clothing will be loose on her but it was way too long"
3.0,"I usually wear XL and XL would've been fine and roomy but I ordered XXL while it was on sale and well, it is boxier fit than I'd like but it's very comfortable to wear around the house or to run a quick errands. A bit stiff feeling on the outside which I don't mind at all and really soft inside. I do love it's style and it didn't shrink but the reasons why I gave 3 stars because the color bleeds so you should only wash this sweatshirt with other black clothes and I wanted to replace it's drawstring to a black one but it was sewn together with part of the hoodie itself so you'd have to tear it apart to be able to replace it. I didn't have any issues with the sleeves length but if you're a tall person and have a long arms then it might be a bit short so keep that in mind."
3.0,I was mislead by the size chart so the fit is not correct. Disappointed.
3.0,Shorter than it looks.
3.0,My son is 13 and it barely stayed on his head it runs small
3.0,"My head circumference is just shy of 22.8&#34; and supposed fit in this hat but I couldn't get it down past my hairline; It is at least an inch smaller than the size range stated. I gave it to my nephew and he loves it, though"
3.0,I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a 2XL. Still a little tight but it’s do-able
3.0,"This extender is made well and the loops were spaced perfectly for my bra, but the elastic part is too loose and makes the extender too large even when on the tightest loop. So, it does extend out as designed, but the extra 3 inches that the elastic stretches out to makes it too loose for me and doesn't provide the support I need now with my bra."
3.0,"Decent ring but wasn't the color I expected.  It was black with a pattern, not as pictured with blues.  It felt and I like it overall."
3.0,kind of see thru
3.0,loose charms but I fixed it
3.0,"Just barely knotted strings is what these are. Granted, they are bolo knotted whick makes them adjustable, but it is silly to buy friendship bracelets. You are supposed to braid or weave the strings, and make them for a friend. These are not woven, and look cheap."
3.0,"Is very long (can be a dress), fabric is soft and comfortable. My measurements are 4'10&#34;, 34B, 28&#34; waist, 100lbs. It looks fine, but is slightly bigger than I'd expect."
3.0,"Very pretty, but one came broken."
3.0,"It’s really soft, stretchy, super comfy, but isn’t a v-neck. Just got mine today. Going to use it around the house bc I feel like it looks more like a jamjam than a piece to go out in. I gave it 3 stars bc it says v-neck and obv by the photo you can see it’s not. Not a total loss, but not what I expected either."
3.0,"It looks great and appears to operate correctly; however, my automatic lost time after being on it for several days."
3.0,"Nice shirts, plastic packaging was not sealed, shirts running very small. My two year old may get only 3 months out of a size 5"
3.0,Is Anklet Jingles/Chalangai included in this set? Pictures show jingles but I did not receive them.
3.0,"If you top heavy and don't care this is perfect, however for me I needed a safety pin and still was uncomfortable. Love the fabric it was nice and soft. The snaps were not bothersome either."
3.0,"The seafoam color is NOT as pictured. It is a dark teal color. Great ties overall, but if you need them for a wedding, make sure you can order with enough time to return and reorder different colors. I purchased the mint color after my return, mint is closer to the seafoam ties pictured, just a shade of two darker."
3.0,No  elastic to hold them up can use a cami over the top holds them pretty well though
3.0,I didnt expect how small it is after i received the product.. but i love the color and the its design
3.0,"Having the need of reading glasses this design works when safety lenses are required, however the glasses do not have ANSI Z87 rated classifications, so they do not meet commercial approval."
3.0,Nice dress but super thin.
3.0,"Comfortable. Stylish enough for me. Seems well made. The only problem is that these shoes are pretty warm. My feet always get sweaty and ultimately smelly. Shoes of this style all seem to have this problem, though, not just this specific brand or model."
3.0,Loved the leather quality and dragon etching. Snap strap and chain didn’t last long. I still like it though I can’t snap closed.
3.0,this is a pretty top - but it was just too big for me. I ordered a medium and gave it to my sister who normally wears a large
3.0,"I have large breasts so I ordered the medium. The breast part is fine, fits perfect, but the rest of the top is baggy and unflattering since my waist is small. I would say it fits as expected if you normally wear M/L swimsuit tops due to stomach area, but if you wear M/L due to breast size alone, skip this. The color is so nice, too bad."
3.0,"A bit thinner that I expected. I wanted something a tad bit heavier. Be sure and wash them before use, they are rough and scratchy. They didn't shrink after washing and drying, so that is a good thing. Probably wouldn't by this brand again."
3.0,I had to return these shoes.  I bought them for my 17 month child and I based the sizing on his stride right shoes.  theses seemed to be the right length but the toe bed was cramped and he wouldn't even let me velcro them on him.  I also think they were tight across the top of his foot.  a lot of babies have &#34;puffy&#34; feet and these were not workable on that front.
3.0,The materials used to make the shoe felt cheap. The Gateway Swift line is much better quality
3.0,The elastic waist band is thin and too tight. It makes wearing very uncomfortable.
3.0,I ordered a small and it is huge. Not flattering at all!
3.0,Larger than size selected. I recommend getting size smaller.<br />If wasn't fir size would be 5 stars ! So freaking cute
3.0,I like the quality but not true to size.
3.0,Light weivhy and warm
3.0,Not as much stretch for listed size n not as shiny as in pic
3.0,Slides side to side too easy
3.0,"3 stars because the front is unlined, like a single layer of white cotton, so you can fully see your nipples and areolas unless you wear a bra. the fit is comfy and cute though."
3.0,Beautiful nice material but way too small like wouldn’t go past thigh range. If you have thick hips like me this is not for you.
3.0,"Keeps shoulders and back protected while be cool snd comfy on hot, sunny days!"
3.0,"I returned this dress. The size small fit fine but it didn't make me feel sexy when I tried it on. I'm 5'3 and currently 135 pounds and usually wear a size small. I'm 18 weeks pregnant and the dress nicely camouflaged my little baby bump. The sleeves were a short but I made them 3/4 length and that looked fine. Additionally, the color of the dress is not a true royal blue, it's a lighter shade. The lighter color blue just didn't pop the way I wanted. For comparison, I put the dress next to a royal blue dress I already had in my closet (see picture). The dress also had a small snag in the front. It wasn't horrible and if I'd liked the dress I would have tied it off and kept it. A lot of reviewers said the chest area was too open but for me it didn't reveal excessive cleavage. I could have worn it to church with just adding a safety pin to ensure it didn't accidentally expose too much."
3.0,I think it was worth it
3.0,"The hoodie is ok I guess. Not happy with how things it is.  If you want a warm hoodie, look somewhere else."
3.0,I ordered this shirt because I had been looking for one in this style and I liked the colors. When I received it the colors were a little brighter than I had expected. I might have kept it anyways except the arms fit very tight and the body was not flattering on me either.
3.0,Belt OK but buckle is a cheap knock off.
3.0,It wasn’t uncomfortable but didn’t fit for bigger bust
3.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they do not stay up. The design is cute, but I’m constantly needing to pull them up they do not stay out."
3.0,very cute but the moment I moved it came off the shoulders so its not very practical
3.0,"There really pretty, just HUGE! I love wearing big earring but these are really big."
3.0,Great size back pack for my 4 year old. Fits well seems to be holding up. My only complaint would that the zipper pull broke within a few weeks.
3.0,They broke fast. They are okay for an event but nothing more.
3.0,Very pretty. They do not fit as well as on the model. Had to bend to put on and then pinch to secure. Am afraid doing this a few times will break them.
3.0,It looked just the the picture. It was a gift for my mom and it was big for her but she still liked it.
3.0,"I have a wrist which is almost 5 inches in circumference, the bracelet was still too big. If you have pliers, then an alteration can be done, no biggy."
3.0,We just received 2 sets of these and right away I could see that they were too small for my husbands shoes. He wears a size 11 and it doesn't come close to fitting it the bag. I guess I will use them for my shoes. I wear a 6.5. I think it said they hold up to size 13. No way.
3.0,It had 2 holes in the seam. I didn't notice until I bought 2 more
3.0,They run small to me I return them.
3.0,Pros:  Perfect Length & isn't overly baggy in places it shouldn't be.  I got a M/L and it fits as expected.<br />Cons: Disappointed that the craftsmanship of this dress isn't better.  (See pics showing the bottom of dress/the hem where it's all uneven.)  Also be aware that the straps are very thin in terms of the fabric that is used to make them.  The pics I posted to show the mesh type material of the dress & this is also what the straps are made of.<br />**Will contact Amazon to see about an exchange.  Until then I can't provide any feedback on the seller's customer service.**
3.0,-fabric was different than I expected. Shiney an stretchy. My daughter currently where’s a 2T and I ordered 3T-4T and it fit perfect. Still very cute but a little darker than expected.
3.0,"These are what they say they are, which is nose pad covers. My glasses were digging into the side of my nose and leaving red marks. So being soft, they relieved the irritation. But man, they are very large and obvious! I didn't like how they looked, so I found other soft silicone pads that REPLACED my existing nose pads (remove the old pads and slip in the new pads) that were much smaller and I prefer them."
3.0,"If you want white, not so great. I’ve purchased dresses from Amazon before, but this one was very um... not flattering. I was hoping it would be a good blank canvas for me to use for an extra wedding dress. Oh well.  Kinda looks frumpy and like it came from a linen closet. Choose ANY color or pattern but not white 😂"
3.0,These are not the most comfortable. I wear Vionic almost exclusively and they are normally pretty comfortable. These hurt my feet a little bit.
3.0,Pretty but does rust on the back of moon after a while .
3.0,The sizing is pretty close to their description. I ordered a (9-12) and it does fit a 9 year old slim child. If your child is above average height or weight I would size up. The sleeves are really short as well. From a distance the print looks good however the closer you get the more washed out all of the detail is. If you hold it up in front of you the print has very little detail as I tried to show in the photos. For the cost of t-shirts today there should be better detailed print front and back.
3.0,WIFE LIKES IT SO THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS
3.0,I like the design and print I was just disappointed that it is tight on the shoulders. I would suggest buying at least one size bigger than usual.
3.0,This bracelet is ok for the cost.  It just doesn't look like the picture. Very dull in color
3.0,I used this once and it worked pretty well. It’s very sticky and stays in place. However after I was done using I had no way to store it. The film that covered the sticky part broke apart as I peeled it off so I couldn’t reuse it. I put it back inside the plastic bag it came in but it got stuck and I wasn’t able to remove all the pieces of plastic in the bra. So I basically only was able to use it once then had to get rid of it. I’ve purchased bras like this before and they’ve come with a plastic container of sorts to store it in. I was on vacation so I didn’t have access to any containers but I assumed I’d be able to remove the film and place it back on when I was ready to pack it. Just beware you have to think about how you’re gonna store the bra after using it if you want to reuse it multiple times.
3.0,"Arrived broken. The ring was separated from the hand piece. I glued it back together. If ordering pls know there's a 95% chance it will arrive broken. Krzy glue fixed the issue for me. Have it 3 stars for this reason, otherwise looks as pictured."
3.0,not as sparkly as I thought.
3.0,"As stated by other reviewers, this bracelet does NOT hold hair ties. The groove is not deep enough to keep hair ties in place. The bracelet is pretty though, and can be worn as a simple bangle."
3.0,"Although the photo looks like the black and white pattern really &#34;pops,&#34; this is actually a dull gray top. I was disappointed."
3.0,These are very comfortable but during my long runs they don’t stay in place very well because of excessive sweat. Would recommend for light to moderate workouts less than 30 minutes.
3.0,"I purchased these so I could have some new PJs in my rotation. The main reason I ordered was for the cotton fabric. They fit fine, although I didn't care for the shorts. I ended up returning because I didn't love them enough to keep."
3.0,"Cute but size up! I’m a true small , 5’6 125 lbs, and the small was very snug around the busy and waist."
3.0,Shirt was too small.  Did not care for the material but I did like the colors.
3.0,I give this product 3 stars only because it is too short :( I am 5'6 and I bought t to wear to a wedding and there is no way it is appropriate to wear to a wedding. Other than that I love this dress! Will probably wear for another occasion or with leggings!
3.0,"Very thin, little tough material. My husband used few times and already ripped it!"
3.0,It took my son 2 weeks before he broke it.Even though it was a very good looking watch and it did not seem like it would break but it did now he has to repair it.The good thing is that it is repairable.
3.0,"Workmanship, fabric, design all deserve 4 stars.  However, sizing is off.  Every body is different however I would recommend you order one size larger if you don’t want a body hugging dress and two sizes larger for a looser fit that more closely resembles the photo. If you are a Plus Size, this beach dress sizing in 1XL, 2XL or 3XL is at least one full size smaller than a true Plus Size in 1X, 2X or 3X.<br /><br />Overall, I rate this midi beach dress 3 out of 5 stars."
3.0,Had to sew it was not sew well and a little cheap.
3.0,"I wore one of them once and the chain just broke the first time. and the other one broke after a couple of times, while I was putting it on."
3.0,"These are UGG brand, if you don't wear socks, there has been a change over the last few years:  When pulling your foot out of the boot, the insole sticks to your toes/balls of your feet, and because the sole of the insert has changed and is not as stiff as before, the insole sticks to my feet and partially comes out every time I take me feet out. The UGG brand used to be stiffer, and I didn't experience this with off brands.<br /><br />This is one of the few times I'll go back to the off-brand."
3.0,Ordered size 8. Could have gone a size smaller. They look cheap but I guess for the price that’s what I got.
3.0,It was a really good material but unfortunately it ran small and the price doubled when I wanted to rebuy it
3.0,"This is the prettiest bathing suit ever.  The shirring in the front is very attractive and comfortable.  In fact, the bathing suit is extremely comfortable and looks so pretty.  However, there is absolutely no bra support.  I am a size 12 with a 38 inch bust.  There are soft removable cups but no band to keep the girls in place.  Sadly, I returned it."
3.0,Two buttons fell off the first time I tried it on and there was black mark on one button. I bought to big of size and it was still way short. It is a cute shirt wish it was better made. Contacted seller and they gave me a partial refund.
3.0,The dress shown is very beautiful. I received mine today and there was weird lace that looked like it didn't belong. I'm only keeping it because of the fit not so much the details of the dress.
3.0,"Love the front, but didn’t realize it would look like shorts in the back. Makes my butt look huge. I wish they were just shorts under and the wrap skirt part was all the way around."
3.0,"When I got this I was disappointed.  It isn't worth what I paid for.  The middle chain was attached in a way that it wrapped around the outer chain.  I eventually just removed the inner chain because it kept bunching up.  The picture isn't very clear but the necklace has red maroon bedas, black and white striped beads and wooden beads.  The length is nice though..."
3.0,These for a five year old well. They are not to heavy or thick. I did not get the link dino one but got two of the Orange dino ones. That is ok. They do not have a nose clip. We will use these for a school and they should work.
3.0,"I liked the dress however, I felt like it was a little tight in the bust.  I ordered the XL, based on the stated bra size, but, I probably should have went a size up.  My bra size is a 40D.  Someone noted that they'd gotten the size up and it felt too big.  That's why I went with the XL.  The waist was fine and the skirt was fine.  In my opinion, my boobs looked smooshed."
3.0,This runs at least 2 sizes small. It’s short too. Considering returning.
3.0,"Nice shoes but, ran smaller than most Sketchers do.  I have never had a problem buying shoes ever before, sketchers or otherwise."
3.0,I did not like the style of this dress on me. I have small boobs and I have a postpartum belly so I looked like a balloon
3.0,decent quality for the cheap price
3.0,"The quality of the bag is very nice, stitching is good and the material is very heavy. However,,, mine was almost a lime green on arrival. I took a chance and bleached it in the wash and the color changed to a light khaki, which is what it should have been in the first place."
3.0,The watch is a LOT thicker than expected. It's not remarkable.
3.0,There was a light stain on the swim suit when I got it ....
3.0,The suit fit easily 1-2 sizes smaller than other brands I ordered. I’m 5’5” 275lbs 22/24 in stores like Lane Bryant and Torrid. I ordered a 26 in this tk err on the side of caution. If fit like an 18/20. I could fit in it but it was not comfortable. Returned.
3.0,One of the charms fell off soon after I received it.
3.0,To Big.
3.0,It fit ok but it rolled down. Runs small
3.0,"I don't know whether to give this 1 star or 5.  It is a GREAT belt even without a buckle.  The problem is, it shipped without a buckle and is too short without the buckle shown in the photos and video.  It is only available at this price in this color and this size.  As others have said, it is not gray.  It is a greenish khaki. The belt is VERY well made; however there is almost no adjustment.  There needs to be at least one additional magnet sewn in."
3.0,"Nice dress, size runs small, material cheaper than expected."
3.0,small size
3.0,For the price they are great. unfortunately only one of the Bras fit my voluptuous beauties so I had to return them all. :-( I am usually a D but these would never have fit me so I guess order a cup size up? they feel cheap but for the price better than I would have expected.
3.0,The color is great and the sizing accurately fit the discription. I am 5'6&#34;  and 145 pounds have a larger chest and this shirt hangs off my frame awkwardly and looks strange.  The neckline is also a little higher than I expected which is probably why it looks strange.
3.0,"rigid, clunky.. maybe better with 2 pairs of thick socks."
3.0,"I purchased these insoles for the arch support.  I was extremely excited for these because I wear uggs and flats all the time and they're both infamous for not providing any support for your feet.  When I put them in my boots, I felt extremely tall and I'm already a tall person.  I found that the arch support felt so hard on my feet that it was actually pretty painful to wear for more than a 1/2 an hour.  I wish that I could say that I could give this product 5 stars, but I just can't.  Maybe it's my feet, who knows.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, share the love : )"
3.0,Had it for just over a year and a  month before it gave out.  The material is very hard and finally gave out where I attach it to other side of the band currently waiting for new watch pins to put on an OEM band I spent the money on. I'm hard on watches and went with the less expensive replacement band and it was good for a bit but should have just paid for real thing.
3.0,"Fabric was cheap and polyester-y. I like the pattern and the color was true to the picture. Fit was large, especially around the top and arms. I should have ordered a size or two down."
3.0,The glasses themselves are well made.  I gave these glasses a moderate rating because the bifocal is what I dislike.  Instead of a progressive lens there is a straight cut off between the strength in the lens.<br />I tried reading and driving with these glasses and it just doesn't work for me.  Driving doesn't feel safe at all because the line is disconcerting.<br />I cannot give these my recommendation.
3.0,"I loved the jacket just too very small, looked like it was for a child and I ordered a 3X.  I hated it...."
3.0,It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  I looked for the size but I never did see it.
3.0,"These block sunlight pretty well but, appearance-wise, they looked better in the picture. They're little too bulky / plasticky feeling for my liking."
3.0,"Good fit, material is nice, but will be returning it because you are able to see the padding shape through it which is not flattering"
3.0,The zipper fell off after wearing it a few times.  Which is sad because it is such a great rain jacket!  It kept me warm and kept my clothes dry.
3.0,Color was bright blue not blue grey..
3.0,Should have requested on size larger and it would have been perfect fit.
3.0,"Cute pajamas, but I’d recommend sizing up. My son usually wears 9 months but I got 12 months because I knew they’d shrink in the wash, but they shrank ALOT. They’re now almost too small to wear. The 12 months fit like a 6-9 month. Size up!!!"
3.0,"The arm bands are weird and keep you from moving your arms right. Rip them off and it's like a tube top muumuu.<br />Way too much fabric for a 5'4"" person. If you were 6 feet tall and skinny it might look better.  On me, I'm wearing Mother's Curtains."
3.0,creo que no puede seleccionar bien la talla y termine regalandola.
3.0,Pink is much brighter than anticipated and the fit is smaller than other shorts by this same brand.
3.0,"Nice, but wears down very quickly"
3.0,"I gave these shirts a 3 star rating because I typically wear a medium and had to order an xl. To top it off, they came in in an xxl. They fit perfectly. The red and black do bleed, so don't wear your favorite light Cami underneath them. The white is completely see through, so you'll need to wear a Cami underneath definitely. They're very thin, but it works well for the gym."
3.0,I wish the hoops for a bigger… these are small
3.0,Beautiful color and material but too small and not high rise enough.
3.0,Good quality but too big.
3.0,The material was ok but not what I was expecting
3.0,Honestly not proportional.  Have to take it in to a seamstress.  My cup size is 38D and my waist is small.shirt fit tight at my waist and very loose at the chest. Terrible sizing issue.
3.0,They are pretty but too small for me
3.0,It sheds so bad it looks like you have dog hair all over you
3.0,I like them. However the bands were a bit stiff and the fasteners were not easy to fit in. But that change after several wears.
3.0,This purse is not big if you are looking for that. It does hold a few items. The color is exact as picture. I like the lining inside. The one thing I do not like is the fake front pocket. Looks like a pocket but it is not :-(<br /> I would have loved that to open up but it still looks nice in front. Strap is good length too.
3.0,Did want was a heavy knit. Wanted a light and airy scarf.
3.0,"I liked but the XXL was too big.  I am a large size, but going off the reviews I orderd a size larger.  Review should be more true to size."
3.0,The product is poor quality and the edges are not finished like other reviewers have pointed out. Been using 2 weeks. Let’s see how long it last
3.0,The claps was broken and we needed it for a show so we had to fix it ourselves.  Otherwise nice looking stone and &#34;chain&#34;
3.0,Very flimsy and the posts came bent. Cute though.
3.0,The quality is not the best. Looks nice.
3.0,"Soft material but there's no sole support. I don't recommend for walking shoes. It's good for baby that is not walking yet. Unfortunately, I need to return it."
3.0,Very cute hoodie but size is not as expected.
3.0,I seized up and I'm glad I did.  The main problem I have I this shirt is that the zipper gets stuck or won't zip properly. It takes me 3 or 4 times of trying to zip it to get the zipper to work and go all the way up.
3.0,It's okay lot shorter then the picture.i order a medium and I'm 5feet tall  the blouse goes down to my wrist line.
3.0,"Beautiful pendant. Tiny necklace, will be replacing before wearing"
3.0,Material is thick and warm but color fades
3.0,"I purchased this for my niece, they are really nice and she loves them, the only negative, only one of the shoes lights up."
3.0,So you get an assortment obviously which is great. I’d find them “ok”. I’d like them to be a smaller width.
3.0,"This bracelet is cute and comes in a little gift box. I think it's probably better suited to a young girl than a woman. I do like the handmade look. The materials are inexpensive, which is why I say it's a good gift for a young girl."
3.0,"Sleeves appear to be in good shape and made well enough, but the size is too large for my mother. She has small arms and this might be helpful information to someone purchasing for an older person who is thinner. Thanks."
3.0,"Pretty color, but wanted it to be thicker."
3.0,Very thin fabric! Will hopefully last awhile but I am worried about washing it too much.
3.0,"I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it fit fine. The color is pretty, it's not sewn too well together. If you pull on it, you feel the seams give."
3.0,"Nice, vibrant color. The material is not too thin, however, the edges are not stitched so it does not look as clean and neat when layered. Overall its not bad, but I would not buy again."
3.0,The shape was not right for my face - they were too flat. Not happy and returned them.
3.0,"I bought one of these and liked it so much, I ordered a second one. I teach elementary music and am in a choir and it worked well.<br />However, the second one was made from a completely different material that is not breathable at all. I started getting out of breath just sitting in one place not even singing or doing anything. I had to keep putting my fingers in the bottom and opening air flow to catch my breath.<br />I would love more of the first one I bought, but I don’t dare order again if I just end up with the second kind.<br />(I did double checked my orders, they are from the same advertisement but we’re definitely different masks)"
3.0,Not a real 2x
3.0,The Key Chain was a good Graduation give for my Nephew. He liked it. It work well. A good buy
3.0,Unfortunately this is a tight fitting garment. I'm a 2x and their 2x was super snug...great quality just to tight :(.
3.0,"they are not worth buying, I had to return them"
3.0,I wear a small and this way to long for me. I have to fold the sleeves for it to fit.
3.0,"Good fit , comfortable"
3.0,I only received 144 instead of 288.  Kinda disappointed about it.
3.0,"It’s ok, the frabic look cheap"
3.0,I could see how cheap it was made but I really liked it for a couple bucks. Fit comfortably. Soft.
3.0,Great quality but sizing is off.
3.0,My daughter gave one  to her friend & one was broken  the clasp would stay close..
3.0,Product was too short for my wife
3.0,These leggings were comfortable. They did nothing to help this old butt though. Lol! I guess I need more help than a pair of leggings can give! I didn’t think they were worth the money.<br />*I felt it best I did not post a picture. You’re welcome. ;)
3.0,"The hat doesn’t open/pop up easily. No matter what we try, only side goes up at a time. Maybe it will loosen up and work better? At least we hope so."
3.0,"After reading the reviews I ordered an XL expecting a fit like the model in the picture. I generally wear a L or XL depending on the cut/fabric of a top. I am 5’8 and a 38DD. This top came to just about my natural waist, above my belly button. It definitely did not go to my hips like the model in the pic. Also the faux knot in the shirt makes a very awkward fit. If you are a shorter person or looking for something between a crop top length shirt and a regular length shirt then this is a great choice. The color is cute and the material is soft, however the fit of the shirt is horrible."
3.0,"These horse charms are ok.  I did recieve 50 charms; 5 designs, 10 of each.  However the listing appeared to be for those specific designs; not random ones.  I received only 1 design that was listed.  Others are so so.  One Pegasus has lost two legs.  Some are double sided and others single sided.  My favorite design from the listing was NOT included in the set I recieved.<br /><br />This isn't the group of charms I was needing for my jewelry design.  I will probably keep them and have to source more.  It would be appreciated if the listing said a similar assortment to the photo is what will actually be sent."
3.0,"It was cute, but the sleeves were to tight..."
3.0,"SO I'm 5'1 198bls 38C I got a XL, it's like tight loose if that makes sense. the Length is great for me. the only issue is that this dress came with a strong smell and I washed it in cold water and it bled like crazy. the lace no longer matches the dress. It went from a deep red to a maroon. otherwise I love the dress"
3.0,"Smaller than I expected,but I guess it's worth the money."
3.0,"My stepson loves it, but after only 2 weeks the screw fell out and he was left with an empty ring.  After figuring it lost, he found the keychain part a week later, so I glued the screw in place and we hope that it holds now."
3.0,"A couple of the socks had bad stitching and started to fall apart after the first few wears. Material is very thin and breathable, but I don't see these socks holding up to heavy exercise / cycling use."
3.0,"I bought these for my trip I had in Feb for Disney world. It looked beautiful when I brought it out the case, however within a day, the ears started to come off of the headband part. Overall, they held up at Disney, and I honestly would next time just spend the money on the more durable ones at Disney."
3.0,Cute but you you have to air the purse out for I Iike a week so the glue smell could go away. Slide runs small so I have to get a 10. I probably needed a 10 1/2. My heel is right there at the sandal.
3.0,"** Take extra care when removing! The tape took some off my skin off during this process / it was painful when it happened till about 5 days**<br />I'm a 36 D so I couldn't figure out how to apply the tape for the perfect lift! I bought this on a whim bc the dress I was wearing to my cousins wedding had a deep V cut.<br />If it's your 1st time using make sure you have enough time to adjust the tape, it took me about 40 minutes: Some parts of the tape wasn't sticking to my chest.<br />Good amount of tape for the price so I have plenty of tape left to get the a better lift next time! (hopefully)"
3.0,"Big and alil too stretchy, they don't keep there form very well. But warm."
3.0,This is made out of the cheapy clothes you buy from the ads on Facebook kind of material. My son can’t stand it
3.0,"Not great quality, but as described"
3.0,not really good as i expected.
3.0,I receive many compliments on the colors but the stitching is not the quality of other leggings I have purchased and the pants are not that full in the rear so feel that it is slipping down.<br />The top does not have a built in bra so I need to wear a sports bra with it. If I was the engineered I would add a built in bra shelf and put a triangle piece of material in the crotch and the stitching should be stronger.
3.0,Not what I expected - it didn’t look right with outfit
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:31be5707008f53438651eca656121e2]] These socks are weird. I wouldn’t say they’re bad… just a really strange material. Imagine like yoga pants material but on your feet. I feel like my feet are being suffocated.<br /><br />The heel has a weird shape / design also. I can see how it would be a positive though because it protects better against blisters!<br /><br />These socks are also very small considering it says they go up to size 12 feet. I am a size 9 and I had to force my feet into these.<br /><br />I don’t know if I just didn’t understand the product before ordering or what, but I don’t like them."
3.0,Not for large heads
3.0,"I paid $65.24 for this vest via Amazon and was initially delighted with it.  Lots of handy pockets, in all the right places, and it was comfortable to wear.  The materials are strong and well reinforced.  I liked it a lot and looked forward to using it for years.  However, by the time I had worn it for about 40 one-hour bike rides, three zippers had broken.  I liked the vest so much that I tried to sew on some velcro to the now useless pockets but it didn't work out.  For 64 bucks it definitely disappointed.  However, I see it, or something very like it from the same brand, available now on Amazon for $29.99.  That may be worth it.  However, for want of quality fasteners the product is useless."
3.0,It wasn't the color it looked like.  Good enough for a child's costume.
3.0,The top is tight and the bottom really lose. Not good for chubby babies
3.0,The only thing NOT LIKED about it is that the one side does not have a place for the checkbook register- I would not have purchased if I knew that
3.0,Too small for my pixel 2 but otherwise very cute
3.0,Not real happy with the zipper. It gets misaligned easily and requires some hard pulling and tugging to get zippered correctly.
3.0,"I wasn’t sure what to expect when I ordered this shirt, but I ended up liking the material (it’s thick, but breathes, and doesn’t seem to attract too much lint) and I didn’t mind the snap closures.  The sleeves look great when they’re rolled up and it’s cut very well through the waist.<br /><br />It IS cut small.  I expected mine to be a big, based on size I normally wear, but it was actually a little tight.  My guess is it’s a full size off, so a Large is actually a Medium.<br /><br />My problem is that it washed up well but was a complete disaster in the dryer.  After only a few minutes on the Damp Dry setting, it completely squished into a wrinkled ball that had to be shaken a number of times just to get it flat enough for the ironing board.  The collar, which was in perfect shape when the shirt arrived, still isn’t quite right.<br /><br />I honestly felt like this shirt required a lot of work for not a lot of return, since it’s nice but really not that special.  If you’re looking for a low-maintenance, reasonably-priced button down I’d recommend continuing your search,"
3.0,The mask was too large. And did not look exactly as pictured.
3.0,"If I had boobs like the photo it would be a crop top!! I put this on and was disappointed. It was short, poor fit and I usually wear a small. It did not look sexy like the photo. Looks like ready to roll out of bed and not in a good way, like hot mess had too much wine."
3.0,Too cheap qualities<br />Glasses coming out
3.0,The shirt good quality and washes great! Three stars because the  saying is off center which drives me nuts.
3.0,"I like the product except it runs way too small, I went on line on April 24th to see that I missed my opportunity to return/exchange this product and the the item was way too small. My daughter normally uses a Large, but this did not even get close to fitting her.  My mom passed away on March 29th and it totally slipped my mind on returning it. I'm not sure if they can exchange it for another item or a bigger size, I have no use for it. I thought I'd try to send this message here and hopefully they can grant a return. thank you."
3.0,Looks good but very thin. Needs the filter to be sufficient. Not very durable but will do for holidays.
3.0,"Seams are bulky, not shown in photo & pants a lighter than expected. But the material is good quality."
3.0,The shipping was fast but didnt like the packing the shoe is too small im a 8 but the shoe feels like a 7 if you order go a size up.
3.0,I bought two pair. So far mine is ok but my husband's broke the second time he wore them.
3.0,Very cute!  But it is somewhat small.  Ordered one size big.
3.0,My 5 year old says he has a hard time breathing with them on. They are nicely made but I have to agree with him.
3.0,"material is tio thin, not good gor cold weather, it'a good just for looks"
3.0,"Although the product works, they don't match the bottom 2 are the originals aren't. One is matte finish while the other is mirror finish. I like the mirror.<br />I called Amazon and was sent another pair the top is the replacement. It's gray, not black. I would like black mirror. Will call Amazon and see what can be done."
3.0,Not thrilled with design.
3.0,Looks okay but quality isn’t great
3.0,"it's okay, but I gave it away after a trip.  The hook is too small and I couldn't find another small hook to hang it on.  The hook wasn't big enough for towel bars so I ended up using it on counters which defeated the purpose of buying a hanging bag.  Also, after it was packed with personal items, I found it to be too bulky to pack and just returned back to separate bags that made packing easier."
3.0,My son liked it just need bigger
3.0,"I bought this in 2 different colors for work. They're soft and really cute, but they definitely run on the small side. I ordered what I normally wear and struggled to get it on"
3.0,Material is weird.
3.0,Not wide and uncomfortable with high instep.
3.0,"I am ok with the gloves, purchased to help with pain in hands and fingers that worsens in the cold. They do help.  I had expected slightly thicker material. The only other downside is that the band at the hand end is a bit tight and moves my fingers far together in an unnatural position. If I put it further down my fingers, the thumb hole is out of place!  Minimal stretch,  comfortable. Basically ok gloves as long as the littke things don’t bother you!"
3.0,"These glasses have good clarity, but the clip mechanism is heavy. Heavy enough that my glasses tend to slide when this is attached."
3.0,"I was expecting something different..... the material is cotton, but not soft or comfortable cotton. The fit is SMALL.  Order a size or two larger than what you normally wear.  After washing it shrinks another size."
3.0,Returned as the bezel was not “slim” enough to button shirt sleeve.
3.0,These are made for a child's wrist. I can still wear them but the elastic strands stretch too far and are gradually breaking.
3.0,The fit and feel is great but the black leggings are very see through. I bought these because of a recommendation from a friend. I am disappointed that they are not thicker.
3.0,ITS a very pretty top but zipper broke first time zipped it up. You get what you pay for but I still was ok. Just can’t wear it til I get the zipper fixed or a new shirt
3.0,I ordered a size 9.5 because I read previous reviews that they ran big.  My 9.5s are still way too big for me (for reference I usually wear a size 11) and match up with a size 12 of another brand I compared them to.  I really wanted to love these because the quality is great and they are comfortable.  I gave them to my friend who wears a size 12 and he says they are really nice.  I wish I had a pair that would fit me!
3.0,It was very thin. So thin I could justify the price and decided to return it. Plus- runs a size small - at least.
3.0,I liked how this fit. It hugged me. I’m 5”8 and 130lbs and I got a small. But I wished I would of got the black color. The pink showed to much. It outlined my curves and belly button. It wasn’t actually see through but looked interesting cause it was so form hugging. And I looked washed out with my medium skin tone. I ended up sending it back. I would recommend this dress in a darker color.
3.0,Incorrect size. I ordered large based off my shoe size and felt like a medium and were way too short.
3.0,Runs SMALL. Like super small. But it’s good quality and held up well in the washer.
3.0,"Comfy, but the straps stretched out some, so harder to keep on my feet :("
3.0,"Very pretty, but broke very easily. Broke first time wearing it. Didn't mind too much since it was near the end of the night, and I thought it was cheap and pretty enough to buy again, but the style is out."
3.0,These are ok.. run a tad bit. I feel like I'd be in between a small and xs but they dont offer xs anyway. The last two photos shown are from another brand's website which is very misleading. The original brand is Curves and combat boots. So this item isnt exactly the same as what those pics show. They're cute but not $26 cute.
3.0,"I love this wallet, I went from a small purse to big one and bought the Stronghold wallet and it helps me be so organized and I feel at peace that my cards are protected!  I agree though that the clear slot where I usually put my driver's license, is stiff and once my license is in it, it's almost impossible to get out.  It catches on the leather lip that is sewn to secure the clear material in place.  Is frustrating and just may cause me to return the wallet. I also agree, a simple round cut out where a finger our thumb could help guide the license out would make a world of difference out.  Other than that (which is a biggie), this wallet is awesome!!"
3.0,Took awhile to get here but is a nice watch.
3.0,The quality of this product is very bad. Everything on the apron is very pixelated so it’s not the most appealing apron. I’m a huge F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV show fan so I’m using it anyway. But overall very poor quality.
3.0,A bit big but has a sense of cool style. I have to wait a bit for my daughter to wear it.
3.0,Tiny too small.
3.0,Fits really well and the “swishy” skirt is the best!
3.0,"very long, i have a 33&#34; waist and the extra will wrap back around to my back pocket area. Once i cut them down and resew on the velcro they will do the job.Not the most durable of nylon, but I think its good enough for the price."
3.0,The watch is nice and works nicely<br />However the band is to short to work with my wrist. I do have larger than average wrist<br />And didn’t mention it when I ordered it
3.0,"Did not like the fabric,  felt and looked cheap."
3.0,"Not a compression shirg not compression at all, but good fabric, and great to wear at the gym"
3.0,Was slightly disappointed...very thin material ...very long.  Probably should have bought in store instead of online.  Doubt I will wear it much.
3.0,Poorly Stitched.
3.0,"It's not clear in the pictures, but this is not just one that wraps around your ear (with shape or a cuff holding it on).<br />There is a stud, so ears must be pierced (all the others we looked at stayed on without a piercing, so I didn't look at the 2nd photo close enough--not that you ever see the stud in any photo)."
3.0,Just not as thick and nice soft cotton like they used to make
3.0,"This dress was very pretty and a nice length on me (I am 5 3) but there was too much fabric and it was bunchy around the waist, even with the belt. I would consider reordering in a smaller size, though."
3.0,No es facil de poner en los zapatos
3.0,"it was cute, but very cheaply made. Be careful when you wear it because it feels like it'll break very easily."
3.0,You need boobs for this swim suit! Anything less than a C cup just doesn't work. I am also 5'11&#34; with a long torso and this suit is not made for my body type. I wanted to love it but it's a fail.
3.0,Disappointed!  Material rather thin. Bought for my husband 6'2&#34; (200 lbs) XL too snug!
3.0,"Product arrived within given time frame. Product color and design was spot on with pictures shown. My main complaint is the sizing and quality for the price. I bought a size up as recommended by others reviewers. My son is 5 and normally wears a 5-6, I bought a size 6-7. It still fit pretty snug, almost giving him a wedgie. I gave 3 stars because he can still wear it, but not for long. It just feels cheap and all of the sizing and everything is in a foriegn language, so it's hard to tell if they even sent the correct size. I would not order from this company again, not worth it for the price. If it was $9.99 maybe."
3.0,WHen it arrived the end piece of the band was not attached. I had to fit the piece back into the place it was meant to be and adjust it to stay. It worked out fine but was not happy to see the small part rolling in the box.
3.0,"Love the shirt,but small in the upper arms and shoulders.did order a medium,after hearing the other reviews,but still tight when lifting my arms.going to return and order a large.thats 2 sizes bigger than usual.hope it will work.hope it won't cost alot to send it bk."
3.0,I would have preferred a shorter version for us petite woman.
3.0,"I loved the look of this hat in the photos and was specifically looking for the more rigid brim like it showed.  Unfortunately though, the brim does not stay put like in the photos.  It is too soft and just flops enough to be disappointing."
3.0,"This bag lasted 2 years.  And most of that time was during the pandemic shutdown, so it wasn't even being used during all that.  First the plastic started coming off around the edges, then finally the plastic started to tear from where it was attached to the strap.<br /><br />Flimsy, but I guess that's what you get for ten bucks.<br /><br />Too bad.  I liked it otherwise.  Although it's a little greenhouse, so don't leave it in the direct sunlight."
3.0,"Very thin and small , broke the second time I wore it."
3.0,Belt works but the black paint scuffs easily.
3.0,"This dress is ok, but nothing spectacular. It’s very loose and makes me look bigger than I am. That being said I will wear it with a scarf around my waste. The material is soft and the quality of the material is alright."
3.0,"This dress is incredibly beautiful.  The fabric is thick and the dress is well made.  While the dress fit at the chest and waist, it is definitely made for tall girls.  There was some weird bunching and poofing out in weird places, which made this dress not flattering for short people."
3.0,Bag is a nice size and will hold a iPhone 7 Plus; compact and lipstick.  The bag does have a chemical smell but not too strong. The glitter does come off onto your hands when rubbed.
3.0,"Shirt is pretty,  but does not look like picture. The arms are go almost down to my wrists... The picture goes to elbow."
3.0,"I ordered WHITE got BEIGE however still accepted, not what I wanted, but can't be bothered."
3.0,Xl is a l . made me feel like the Hulk lol but i knew it would fit my mom so i gave it to her n she luvs it .
3.0,For a sock can wear in the winter I would think it would be warmer and it’s not
3.0,"I am not full figured, it is a little snug in the bust area. I wish it was cut wider because the opening to put it on is just to mid chest. I did observe that it’s not a full button down. I took a chance on the style and was unfamiliar with the light weight fabric. I washed it in cold water and air dried it. It was very wrinkled but it was easy to iron. Black & white check will be ok in the fall. At $16. I decided to keep it."
3.0,The chain was too short so I had to go buy a new chain
3.0,Too big but great for the price
3.0,"These are comfy and really good in wet and cold weather. However, there is NO arch support, no memory foam insole. Just a flat bottom. So, if you purchase these, buy yourself some gel insoles. You will need to."
3.0,it's ok. A little cheap.
3.0,"Received the wrong one but still liked the new one designs so kept it. Bottom fits funny and they stay sliding off at work, I have to wear them as Capri's. Not sure if I want them anymore because I'm not sure if I will wear them again ...... Maybe not outside the house"
3.0,"I bought this in a 4X.  I normally wear a size 12/14.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 180 lbs, with a 34G cup.  I probably could have gone with a 3X, but I didn't want to take a chance that it wouldn't fit my chest.  It's so cute, and fits well everywhere except the length.  The torso length is really ridiculous. There is probably at least 4 inches of extra fabric. You would have to be 6 feet tall to wear it comfortably.  Since it was so cheap and since I know how to work a sewing machine, I will take it apart and turn it into a tankin. If you are short, this is probably not the suit for you."
3.0,Pretty and different- but I even exchanged the sizes and the Top portion fits so awkward. Can’t wear it :(
3.0,They were a little snug for my 6 month old.
3.0,"I'm quite torn about these sunglasses. When I originally received them, I completely fell in love with them. They felt like decent quality forth price and looked so good on. I received a ton of compliments. Unfortunately, within the first 2 months they got scratched so easily, even with me being careful to always keep them in their case.<br /><br />I'm debating whether they're worth buying again because I love them, but they last for such a short amount of time."
3.0,very loose- big
3.0,"Nice bag with lots of huge pockets.  The color is really nice, deep blue.  Glad I found this one, I plan to take on my trip to Europe.  I haven't packed it as yet but will leave and update later.<br /><br />Rated only 3 stars since I haven't used it yet.<br /><br />Con: the bag had lots of loose threads on it, I cut them off.  Hope it doesn't cause a problem later when its loaded."
3.0,"I am glad i went a size larger than I normally wear in this shirt because it really clings, should have gone two sizes bigger."
3.0,"I have a giant head compared to most people. It has always been a problem.  This hat stated that it was 3xl, and it was pretty affordable when I ordered it.  I have to say, that while 3xl in pretty much every other hat will fit me ( I typically wear between 8 1/4 and 8 1/2 in a fitted hat if that helps) this is just a hair on the small side.  It doesn't squeeze my head, but it just sits a little higher than I would like for something that is supposed to keep you warmer. I'll still use it, but not when it's bitter cold out."
3.0,This headband gave my daughter a headache because it was too tight for her head.  She has a pretty small head too.
3.0,very pretty but for a small wrist
3.0,"Nice gloves, even if the fabric is a bit thin."
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but it was more delicate than I thought it would be.  Also, the fastener was tiny and difficult to manipulate when putting on/taking off the necklace."
3.0,"It was shorter and a little small and the sides were longer than expected, but I'm still going to wear it"
3.0,"These look like the photo in terms of colors and design. They are thinner than I was expecting and they are usually short in the crotch. I bought a size larger than I typically wear because I know joggers are meant to be slim fit and I wanted more room. They are roomier in the ankle and calf but still a little tighter than I would like in the butt and thighs. The biggest issue is the crotch, I cant sit without exposing the top third of my butt. I only 5'9 so I dont require tall sizes. Even if I lost 20 lbs this would still be a problem. Got a good deal so I'll probably just give them away to a short relative or friend."
3.0,"Cute, comfortable a little on the long side.. mostly fit well."
3.0,Giving it 3 stars for quick delivery and the product seems decent. But the fit was terrible. I'm 5'1 and petite and looked absolutely ridiculous in it!  Too bad I was hoping to have it to bring to the Dominican with me.
3.0,Love the color and style of this top.
3.0,How in the hell do I know it’s a xmas gift
3.0,"They are very big, wish the were a bit smaller but that’s just me."
3.0,These were not quite what I expected....the cloth uppers felt rubbery...not at all like cloth....they don't look like they will hold up very well...and don't have support like similar style of reefs that you can get for close to the same price on sale. The shipping ($5) definitely made them overpriced and I would not buy them again for that reason.<br />On the up side...super cute!! nice details with the little gems and design on the instep....straps are comfy...soles are ridged so shouldn't be slippery.
3.0,Cute - I'd say runs about a size small.  I got a 6/6x for my 4T (maybe barely 5T daughter) - it's just a little big on her.  She's about 40 inches tall and 36 lbs.  After a few washings started coming apart at seams - so that was a little disappointing.  Soft and fuzzy like a light fleece blanket.
3.0,"Very pretty, but poorly made and looks like a one or two time wearing item before it breaks or color wears off."
3.0,"It probably cost about 20 cents to make, but the hat lasted the entire night/morning so I call it a success.<br /><br />Whoever you're buying this for; happy birthday to them."
3.0,"I got these per my request for Christmas. Both the top and bottoms were in their own bags so I know they weren't touched from the time they were manufactured.<br />There were holes in BOTH pockets. They were just not sewn properly, I was hugely disappointed.<br />For this price, I would have expected better quality assurance and inspection from the manufacturer.<br /><br />I'm willing to exchange these in hopes for a better quality set, but if it happens again, I'm giving these one star.<br /><br />They are nice, roomy and soft and would have been perfect if there weren't manufacturing defects, which is why it's three stars right now."
3.0,The bag says it's a six but can't be a six I've been sized professionally and it's got to be a eight based on the sizeable gap compared to some of the other rings I have
3.0,"Runs big, but is cute!"
3.0,"Ok, but not as warm as I wanted them to be. They also run very large (and this is coming from someone with very large hands.<br /><br />For 19.99, whatever. If they had been more expensive I would have been upset."
3.0,Somewhat ill fitting skirt.
3.0,I got a 2x and I think it's a lg!
3.0,"Ordered these gloves last minute for a trip to France during the wintertime. Sufficiently kept my fingers warm. I got coffee on it when walking around and the ""leather"" disintegrated."
3.0,"Waist fit my fiancé just fine (he’s a medium in everything), but who has legs as long as these things?! It was ridiculous how long these pants are. There was an extra 8” of pant leg left once he put them on!<br />So I ordered a size small. Waist fits fine. STILL!!! The legs were still SO long. Only about 4 extra inches of fabric but holy crap, guys."
3.0,"This robe has a soft terry lining and smooth poly type fabric on the outside.  You have a choice of two positions of belt loop heights,  but it's missing an inner tie that keeps the robe secure and hanging straight when on. <br />I do like the two robe hooks that make it easy to hang. There are also two side pockets. As far as size I ordered the medium (I'm 5'6, 122 lbs,) and find it a generous fit.<br />Other than the brand label found on the inside collar, it's missing labels that show fabric content, origin and washing instructions.  It's a comfortable robe however I am not crazy about how it hangs in the front.  I've posted some photos and hope that they along with my experience helps you out a bit with your choice.  Thank you."
3.0,"Order 2 sizes bigger from your original size.  I like the shorts, but they were too small."
3.0,Kind of a funny fit or my toddler didn’t know how to correctly position his fingers. They slipped off a lot but if you put these on before the jacket there’s no problem.
3.0,"Got it but the zipper is very hard to undo, and get on"
3.0,"Returned, Digital screen was messed up on arrival.  Very comfy though."
3.0,Pretty shirt but not long at all. The picture makes it look longer than it actually is.
3.0,"They are comfortable, warm and seem to keep feet dry. However, they are thin and a hole was ripped in one while trying to pull it up."
3.0,"Really pretty, but the quality isnt great. The day I received it I tried it on. Couldnt get it off and the snap started to rip thru the keathern. Priced well"
3.0,My grand kid I had to order two pair just so they one could fit her  her size was too small.when she takes her feet out of them it’s like pink cotton all over her toes .wasnt very satisfied
3.0,wish there was other size choices. love them even though he will only wear then once or twice. too cute!!
3.0,Cute dress but ordered small and fit too big.
3.0,The fit was TTS with a nice inside lining. The sherpa material was not soft and reminded me of carpet material. I wanted to love it but decided to return it due to the look of the sherpa.
3.0,A little on the rough side.
3.0,So comfortable but it literally fell apart the first time I wore it. I don’t know if I just got a defective one or something but I only lasted in total 12 hours. Pretty unhappy since it looks brand new but it’s super cute but very broken.
3.0,It's ok. I should have picked another color.
3.0,The pin looks amazing. That being said the pin isn’t very strong and bends easily. I had to pin it through about 3 layers on thin fabric and I just kept bending. If you plan on using it on thin fabric I would highly recommend because the pin is beautiful!
3.0,My 4th grader could have stitched this better. There are pieces of loose thread everywhere. The buttons were sown on with one piece of thick thread and it’s just dangling. The cape has loose threads as well and upon pulling one it seemed to alter it. So no more tugging. I don’t have the time to return it so I will make it look like something.
3.0,"These look great at first but do not hold up well at all. I've now owned about 6 of these bands in various colors and they all break the same way after a few months of use. They break where the band connects to the fitbit. It is a very thin plastic on the actual clip that holds it on. At first when the leather is new, it is stiff, so it acts like a nice reinforcement to an otherwise flimsy connector, but once you wear them for a while and the leather starts to break in and get soft, it's only a matter of time before the wafer thin plastic connector snaps and your band falls off. As much as a I like the look of these, after going through so many, I've gone back to primarily wearing the silicone bands and occasionally swapping it out for a milanese one when I need to dress up."
3.0,Not what I imaged.  Lenses are way to big for my face
3.0,I've got a big 'ole punkin head so these are pretty tight around my face. I do wish they would have had hemmed edges. 1 has started to unravel pretty badly. I wear 1 each day then hand wash them all at one time since they're not hemmed. I'd probably buy them again if I couldn't find something else.
3.0,"I like it ok… I probably wouldn’t buy it again… I ordered black and it’s more like a dark gray. I typically wear small and it’s too big for me, my watch slides around. If it fit and was the correct color… it might be ok."
3.0,I like the removable pads. This is a good supportive tank/bra for light workouts. Fit is as expected. Nice stretch.
3.0,"It runs big, especially in the shoulders. It is more rectangular than a-line. The fabric is ok -- bright color, nice print, but more polyester than cotton."
3.0,Looks good but cheaply made.
3.0,The length is great but they are super low rise.
3.0,Very think material and you can see through it.
3.0,This is cute. The material shows every line beneath the shirt. It runs small for sure.
3.0,Shower curtain like
3.0,"Very snug, but I love it :) it is very tight for 34 C bra if you like maximum cleavage :) I got this for a sexy Renaissance Festival for a sexy elf costume :)"
3.0,Style is cute but material is flimsy like cheap stiff felt. Runs a bit large and definitely need to add sole support inside bcz it has little sole structure. It has really strong water proof spray smell and it needs to be aired out outside.
3.0,Es muy bonita pero se rompe con mucha facilidad
3.0,"Reminded me of a watch I saw on someone I admire so I bought this one.  Looks very nice, fits well.  It is supposed to be self-winding, as you move it winds.  I often sleep at night, don't use a watch, and its always dead as a doornail in the morning.  If you are not swinging your arms around it is slow to keep time."
3.0,"Fit was a little larger than what I was expecting or from the pictures. This mostly occurs in the pockets and makes my hips look twice their size, whether it’s zipped up or not! My zipper is also chipped and sharp so I almost cut myself on it trying it on. I was able to fix this super easy with a nail file!<br />The chest/shoulders fit like most “small” clothing items. The fur material is very soft and it is lined with a thin plastic type material; very lightweight. I am 5’5” and 122 pounds, I ordered a small."
3.0,"Color is more red than burgundy like it looks in the picture & the neckline is so low it shows cleavage. It was embarrassing to show up at a wedding wearing bright red when I was supposed to be wearing burgundy. It made me stick out like a sore thumb in the family pictures. On top of that, the tank top I ordered to cover my cleavage, which was true to the color in the photo, clashed with the dress color. I gave the dress 3 stars because it fit well & has pockets & despite the color issue, it is a beautiful dress. Also, it isn’t the manufacturer’s fault I had to find a Burgundy dress at the last minute."
3.0,If it perfectly even though I gained a little weight
3.0,Runs large. Washed it on gentle cycle and the green ribbon came off.
3.0,"Material is scratchy, but otherwise ok."
3.0,The watch looks expenssive but works like the cheap ones. Gained 3 minutes one night and lost 5 minutes the other night...
3.0,The picture is extremely deceiving. In the picture it looks like they are nice and smooth but in fact it fits more like a diaper that's way too big on you and a super tight waistband.
3.0,It fit me weird. Both the large and medium were too big in the chest and the pockets made it puff out
3.0,not for men to small
3.0,Felt weird to wear. To tight on the upper
3.0,Plastic part on eye cracked during first wear. It's an ok mask and will work for Halloween. pretty basic.
3.0,This is very okish? The fabric is pretty light but the sewing is not the best. The cut and style is actually pretty good if only they had slightly better fabric and production.
3.0,"WELL THE COLOR AND DESIGN IS PRETTY, LIGHT AN DFUN TO WEAR, BUT  SIZE  IS MORE BIGGER , ESPECIALLY CHEST AREA, THE V LINE IS LIKE DROPPING, DOESNT STAY , WEARING IT JUST BE CAUTIOUS ALL THE TIME COZ THE BRA MIGHT SHOW UP WITHOUT YOU KNOWING, I PUT A PIN ON IT , STILL NEEDS ALTERATION...TOTALLY"
3.0,Both pair have already started to lose right screw. Have tighten them but they won't stay in.
3.0,Love the color. Bag is on the cheap side
3.0,I missed the return window as I would've returned it. The shirt is cute but the under fabric is only covering a 1/4 of the front so it looks like an unfinished product.
3.0,The waistband is too high up. It starts just below the bustline making for an unattractive appearance.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but was too long for me.  I am 5 ft 1 and this shirt seemed to run big.  I liked the material and would have kept it if I was taller."
3.0,Ouch!  They hurt my ears!  The clips and area between the post and clip is toooo small!' They are beautiful!!
3.0,A little bit longer that I was expecting
3.0,"I have an issue with this Necklace, it has falling apart. I would like a second one sent out to me."
3.0,"Great mask but it was broken, had to glue it and use it arrived 1 day prior to needing it."
3.0,"If you have hips, go at least a size or two larger."
3.0,"Seeing as I am rather chesty, and I thought that this would work to hold my boobs, this thing was meh! Cute, yes, comfortable, yes, long enough, yes. However when it came to fitting the part you dont want seen it failed terribly."
3.0,"I really like the shape of these and they do look cute on. However, from the pictures, I thought the lenses would have a yellow/amber tint and that was the main reason I purchased them. So, I was disappointed that they had a regular grey tint. I decided to keep them because they are a flattering shape for my face but, if I had known that they were a grey tint I would not have purchased them to begin with."
3.0,I washed it in cold before wearing and hung it on the line.  I swear it shrank 2&#34; all around!  It's now very short!  I'm a size 6-8 and had ordered a Medium.  The construction of the nightgown is good - solid stitching and nice not quite see through cotton.
3.0,They were all nice and sturdy besides the sandworm. I opened the box and it was bent.
3.0,"The top half is super long so the straps need to be tied up, but the bottome half is short so the the pants are not full length and look more like capris"
3.0,"I like these hairnets because they don’t flatten my hair like the standard type do. But the elastic is SO TIGHT that it leaves an indentation in my forehead and cuts off the circulation in my ears! I never THOUGHT I had a “large” head, but obviously, that would be a better fit for me."
3.0,"The bar is pretty long, but luckily the top can screw off and I can put a small bar on it. The ball does fell kinda big in my mouth, but its tolerable. Other than that its really pretty and nice to add to my collection."
3.0,Loved them for the first 2 wears after that they seemed stretched out and very loose.
3.0,It's ok. Not my style
3.0,"I was so excited when I tried on the mask.  It fit beautifully!  I then washed and dried it according to the instructions enclosed, and every mask shrunk.  I doubt these will be comfortable when wearing now that they have shrunk, although I may give them a try.  So unfortunate, as the design in great.  I may buy them again and only hand wash and air dry.  I wish I could let the seller know to warn buyers of shrinkage after drying in a machine."
3.0,"The bonnet fabric feels good and with the string I get it to fit my small head. The problem is the drawstring has no cord stopper, how is it supposed to stay put if it can become loose so easily... also the bonnet itself is not very big so if you have long hair, alot of hair or big curls this might not work for you."
3.0,"This blouse is absolutely beautiful. Appears to be well made. The only thing..it's see through. I got this for my grandmother to wear. She will NOT go for wearing a shirt or camisole under a shirt; she hates her arms showing, so she'd have to wear long sleeves under long sleeves...in Louisiana that ain't happening. So, off it goes, back home. But I'm sure other ladies will love it."
3.0,I ordered a XXL and after i received it i realized its a European XXL which is equal to our XL here in the US.
3.0,This dress fit a little tighter than I expected and it is a little thin.
3.0,Usually a large and order large. Fit little snug and straps fall down a lot. It's cute but not 100% satisfied or like or.
3.0,It worked amazingly for a while but then it broke while I was walking
3.0,Cute dress just when I tried it on wasn't for me had to return it
3.0,"Earmuffs are paper thin and are cheap.<br />Hat is not lined and is thin too<br /><br />Gloves and neck warmer are nice.<br /><br />Would not order again, three is generous"
3.0,"The description made it sound like the large were for kids and everyone and I hate tight fitting mask.  Well I hate mask period. They are for criminals. But back to these. They are nice and breathable as advertised I just messed up and ordered Goliath XL mask. Don't order XL unless size really matters and you are 6'8"". My mistake not the manufacturer"
3.0,"Doesn't sit well at my waist, fits tight on my butt"
3.0,"Love the dress but it’s too long , about 2 feet too long ( I bought a medium)"
3.0,These fit fairly well. They are fun and colorful. I love that they are recycled cotton. They might gotten 4 stars but I don't like the way they bunch up in two places where the fabric is plain.
3.0,I'm 5'8. Way too short. Perfect  for my daughter who is 5'4. Otherwise very nice.
3.0,"I was surprised that there is not a small zipped pocket for coins.  Also, the card slots are not all big enough for many of the cards I have."
3.0,"It was okay for me, but my nephew loved it while it lasted!"
3.0,"Glasses are nice but, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is there not glare resistant and its actually harder to see at night"
3.0,I know that Sailor Moon is an 80's/90's television show. I would've just like to have seen the shirt to be brighter so that I can really see it's the original team. I can see everyone clearly but I would've preferred it to be bold.
3.0,"Very pretty but very heavy.  So heavy it is tiring to wear for more than a couple of hours.  Also, cannot tap fitbit while it is housed in this bracelet but it will still rack up your steps.  But it is really pretty."
3.0,This shirt is rather transparent.  With a white undershirt it looks okay and is comfortable to wear.  It definitely must be pressed after laundering.
3.0,"Pretty and smart looking. HOWEVER, it pulls very easily. When wearing: stay away from jewelry and anything else that could cause a pull. Fortunately, I sew, and could repair it. But I would not buy another one ."
3.0,Unfortunately the belt split - the top shiny stuff started peeling off.  It was plenty big.
3.0,"The bat wings fit great. The other not so much. It is loose and even when you tighten, it doesnt fit well on the face."
3.0,Material looks a bit cheap up close but great color.
3.0,I was not at all impressed with the quality of Kormei's women's short sleeve summer party dress.  Even with the white draw string in the back (why white?!) it just did not hang right on my body. The drape of the fabric was also not the same as in the photograph.
3.0,"Me: Size 43 jacket / 35 waist.  I purchased this shirt in size &#34;L&#34;.<br />I would not call this fit &#34;classic&#34;.  The fit is a bit snug and leaning in the &#34;trim&#34; direction. Not my first Tommy Hilfiger &#34;classic&#34; shirt, which fits well, BTW,  so either my previous shirt is too big or this one too trim.  It's an OK shirt.  I like the third button down button on the back of the collar and the little preppie T.H. logo on the pocket.  ...otherwise, this is just a very basic  light to medium weight all cotton shirt.<br />CAUTION!!!  The packaging is overdone; Buyers could have saved a buck or two if T.H. just would fold the shirt and stick it in a bag! The shirt has (like others, unfortunately) the collar stay, paper liner, assorted shape holding widgets, blah, blah, blah BUT on this shirt some genius decided that the shirt would be better with double Tee end plastic fasteners holding the [short] sleeves in place along with other sections of the shirt.  DO NOT PULL!  If you're not really careful you can have a brand new shirt with unwanted holes in it!  To remove the plastic fasteners (similar to those on blue jean rear pocket tags/labels) requires good light, good vision and patience and an implement of cutting!  This isn’t sturdy blue jean fabric so proceed gently!  Don't risk yanking the sleeve away from the body of the shirt. Get out your reading glasses and some tiny scissors and take your time unpacking the shirt.<br />(photo of clipped fastener attached)"
3.0,The shirt would be great if it wasn't SUPER SMALL. bummed cause its so cute and i love tacos. i guess i need to eat less tacos...
3.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors of this hat, i was soooo disappointed when I put it on and it didn't fit worth a darn. it is a shallow hat, meaning when it sits on your head it doesn't come down the side very far.  I like a hat to almost sit on my ears. this one was no where close. i ended up selling it to a friend for what i paid. it fit him ok"
3.0,Very stretchy. Pockets are a plus. I’ll order again. Maybe a size up.
3.0,"It keeps everything organized nicely, but the material on the inside isn't stiff enough. As a result, it's a little twisted and bent after minimal usage and time in my bag. It will be perfect if they take care of that issue."
3.0,"I like these sunglasses in that they do provide shielding from sunlight for the eyes, but have issues with their hard shaped plastic design. The only thing lacking is that they arrived in a clear plastic bag and thus, have no case for protection against scratches that are inevitable with everyday use. They work well with providing adequate protection against having to squint in bright sunlight. They are extremely rigid however, and offer no pliability so even putting them in a shirt pocket can be somewhat uncomfortable in that there is no &#34;give&#34; in their shape. They are constructed of plastic. I was offered these glasses in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I have given both here and I would have to say that you could purchase a pair that is comparable at a local dollar store."
3.0,I had to give it to my sister as it fits too tightly and had too much cleavage.
3.0,"Looks nice, but it broke the first time I wore it.  The band broke as I was putting on my coat.  It also didn't come with instructions on how to shorten the band, and you have to be extra careful because it's wood.  I wanted to love it, but it was wasted money. Edit: The seller contacted me right away and Amazon made the return easy."
3.0,"Let me try to be nice. I should have know that this was less than perfect when I got 6 for the price of one. One end of the strap is not sewn on so do not lengthen them too much or it will come undone. As for the term “anti-slip” it must be a wish and not an item description, as the glasses do not stay on the strap when tightened (not to mention if I am sweating). The reason I give it 3 stars is because I have figured out how to make them work (Or else I would have given then NO stars). When you get it you will notice a metal ring at the send supposedly to tighten the grip of the strap onto the glasses. The designers must have a sense of humor when/IF they tested this out. Throw out the metal piece as it is useless. Place your glasses inside the rubber “holder” and spin it until it is tight enough to not slip then insert the end of the eyeglass arm (the part that goes over your ears) back into the first hole that you created when you spun it and that will hold it (Kind of like a fisherman’s knot). Good luck."
3.0,looks good. has not rained yet to use it tho
3.0,"These were too tall for me.  I am 5'1'' and the top of the boot hit the middle of my knee.  I returned.  Also, the zipper in back was snug."
3.0,Definately for bust woman. It's super cute and the style is great but too loose for me on the bust.
3.0,"This fits well, but is definitely not as flattering as it is on the model. The legs are super wide, which is comfortable for me as I have thick thighs, but also gives the bottom half an unflattering/outdated look. Buttons do actually function, which is why I ordered this to try. I probably won't wear this out much, but it seems like a comfortable, nursing friendly, easy to throw on outfit for the summer."
3.0,Purchased it as a gift and the 3 star rating is due to the way it fit. I may be perfect for other people but the person I bought it for did not like the way it fit her.
3.0,Not as detailed as the pic
3.0,"The pads are nicely constructed, but unfortunately will need to be modified to fit Bolle Heatseaker sunglasses. I will likely still be able to use them."
3.0,A little big but so cute
3.0,"They don't work as well as the kids think they will. They are not worth the money, save yours and buy regular slippers."
3.0,"Bought for my grandson, he loves it but pants appear 2 sizes larger than shirt"
3.0,"These leggings are pretty warm. I live in a desert climate and couldn't run in them, but they work for lounging/running errands.The biggest issue is that the front has too much room and back has not enough. I could use a few inches of legging taken from my muffin top and given to my bum. It takes some wiggling to get them in a mostly comfortable spot."
3.0,Has strips to help tack down. They work but not well
3.0,"These are okay, I thought they were a little prettier in the photos but I still like them."
3.0,very tight around the thighs buy size up if purchasing this item
3.0,Its a beautiful bathing suit but I should have ordered small. I'm 5'4 125lbs.
3.0,It smelled weird upon opening the package. had to wash it and hang dry immediately. However the dress is extremely comfortable  the color looks like a mustard yellow in the picture but it’s actually yellow yellow!
3.0,"Uncomfortable for daily use, works well for working out"
3.0,"I was sent this direct by the manufacturer for review purposes.<br /><br />Watches. If you're in the market for a timepiece, there are quite a lot of brands to choose from and literally thousands of actual watches to sort through from a few pounds up to something slightly more expensive, let's say. To add to that burgeoning list is this ticker from a company called BesWlz.<br /><br />It's at the cheaper end of the market, so I wasn't expecting much, least of all something the size of a small dinner plate. Black and orange, there's both analogue and digital readouts with the latter also showing day, date, stopwatch and alarm. That's all simple enough but what I've never understood is why these watches have flashing signs that have no discernible function. The one on this watch is on the left side and has markings from 10 to 60. However much I've investigated, I can find any reason why it's there.<br /><br />The four buttons are recessed and even though I have small hands, I find they need a fairly hefty push to activate, so those with large hands may have difficulty. The strap has the widest 'pin' for the holes as I've seen. Usually, it's a small pointed affair but the one here is a wide thing with equally large rectangular holes on the strap itself. It's also water resistant against splashes, etc. It's nothing exciting. It tells the time, which is all you need to know. The enclosed instruction sheet is easy to follow and it's cheap. It's stamped as 3ATM, which means it's splash and rain proof only. Oh, and there's a backlight too.<br /><br />It might be billed as a watch for a child but they'll have to use their other arm to help lift their watch bearing one to look at it.<br /><br />One thing that I found wrong and against the ethos of Amazon is the enclosed card. It offers a money off coupon if you give five star feedback. Okay, it might only be $1 but that isn't the point."
3.0,"I bought these to go with supergirl halloween costume. They are perfect in regards for that use. Very bright lights, and granddaughter loves them. I would order up a size though. The sketcher brand shoes are large on my grandchild....these barely fit and are tight."
3.0,This dress is gorgeous! I'm so sad it just didn't work out for me. The top is poorly made with pads poorly sewn onto inside of top. If you have large saggy breasts it will not work for you. But the dress itself is beautiful.
3.0,It works great and came on time.
3.0,I really really loved this jacket but I ordered an XL and to me it fit like a medium. I would definitely go a size up.
3.0,"The quality of the glasses is good but the fit is terrible. At first they look exactly like the Dior soreal, but these sit too high up on the nose and look funny. I put them next to my real Dior pair and the difference of where the nose tabs were placed was very noticible. I won't return them cause it will cost too much in shipping but I will not wear them either cause it looks odd:"
3.0,I should have ordered a longer chain. lol Other than that i liked it.
3.0,These are nice but tiny for a child
3.0,Very cute swim wear...but unfortunately it's a bit large for me. I bought a small.
3.0,I loved the feel and the quality of the shirt but it shows every curve. The ones you like and the ones you don’t like.
3.0,"This is a very nice looking bracelet, but it is too big for me, I will save it and use for a gift, because of its quality."
3.0,Like the hat. It's ok.
3.0,"The pattern is gorgeous, but the silk is much heavier and stiffer than I expected.  Haven't decided if I want to keep it yet...."
3.0,Inside material feels very thin and the zippers are a cheep quality. I planned on using for an every day purse and I hope it holds up for a few months.
3.0,"The shoes are the correct length, but they are too narrow for my feet."
3.0,"I really like the jacket.  Rode my bike on a cold morning and it kept me warm.  I like where they have the zippered pockets.  It arrived weeks sooner than promised.  The only negative is that I ordered a large size but received a medium in U.S.size.  A bit snug for me, but kept it just the same."
3.0,From image of picture I thought it was a heavier sweater nit a thin t shirt material.  Sizing was good just material was not what I expected.
3.0,"I ordered the white dress for a classic look. It was beautiful and I looked great in it....except that is super see thru. I know white typically is, but can usually be masked with a beige undergarments. Not so much. Every color underwear you could tell, white bra you could see it. I sent it back because I'm not sure if even a slip would help"
3.0,"But a lot larger than I thought they were. Plus, I’m not a fan of the pressed paper and faux leather materials. Doesn’t seem to hold up well, and can break off the metal easily."
3.0,"Don’t be fooled by the advertised pictures, they do NOT ARRIVE WITH BELTS"
3.0,Not wh as t I expected.
3.0,Two pieces. Was difficult to figure out how I was supposed to wear it. Not very flattering. Returned it.
3.0,"It fit me fine at the bottom. But the top half for the breast area was super large , it was super big at the top, also very short romper. Behind is out at the bottom. Be careful with bending over / walking."
3.0,"Its great that it was fit to size, but, I just felt the material was thin and had to wear an extra white tank underneath because a nude color bra wasn't enough to cover.  You get what you pay for, I guess."
3.0,A bitch to set otherwise OK.
3.0,This dress is so lovely but is when you put on doenst fit good the skirt is too wide and long.
3.0,"The dress doesn’t have a definite shape.  I’m taking into account that I received an XL size and I usually wear a Medium.  Although the fabric is soft, it’s thin.  It’s not something to be worn in winter or even late autumn.  The cowl neck is also not well-defined.  I spent 5 minutes trying to get it to spread out in a flat and orderly fashion.  I like the color combination of black on top and gray on bottom.  There are 2 false pockets and a black ribbon on the cowl neck.<br /><br />The length from neck to hem is 34 inches.  The sleeves are 25.5 inches long.  I washed it in warm, and the material held up pretty well.  No wrinkles.  It did shrink by 20% after tumble dry in warm.  Before, this XL dress was too large for me, and now it’s only slightly large for me.  I would size up to allow for shrinkage.  For warmth, I would add a slip and leggings."
3.0,I liked the design of the product but it was a gift and the watch was not working.
3.0,Picture is off center. Smelled like petrol out of the box
3.0,"This isn't a good look for my pear shaped body.  The ruffles seem to create a visual of a wider bottom, especially since I'm not a busty lady.  On me this suit is very unflattering.  I would think (based on the photo) that it would look much nicer on a lady who has less curves or a bigger bustline.<br /><br />I really liked the idea of the ruffles for more coverage like a tankini.<br /><br />The fabric isn't great.  The bottoms (I have black with flowers) has a printed on design.  The backside of the fabric is actually white.  So whenever stretched the white fibers show through on the right side of the fabric.  That doesn't look very nice."
3.0,"Product is wonderful. Only problem is, waist band is half elastic and fits a size large only. While I'm sad, my daughter is thrilled to death with her new pants."
3.0,These shorts are super cute but they did not stay up (waistband) at all as I was running/working out
3.0,"This jacket is a nice jacket if you're looking for something that you can dress up or dress down, I like the light material it's not too heavy so if you are wearing a nice dress underneath or blouse it works. I didn't like how tight the arms were, and if you're expecting it to cover your bum in the back, it doesn't! It's short in the front and the front comes down a little longer.  I'm 5'3, 215 and ordered an XL and should've done an XXL but didnt have time to send back so I kept it but made it work!"
3.0,"It was a thinner material, ran small for size, my teen son didnt like the feel of it, so we ended up returning the shirts pretty quickly."
3.0,"I needed a dress belt because the 15-year-old one I had was finally looking ratty enough to replace. I got this one because it claimed ""top grain leather"" and the pictures looked good. It looks fine, but it feels more like plastic than leather, and I question how long it will actually last. It wasn't bad enough to return (also I only wear a dress belt a couple times a year). And for the price it's fine. I just don't think it's actually top grain leather."
3.0,"Unlike other reviews, I found the dress fit perfectly around the waist but was several sizes too large in the bust. I have a decent sized bust at 32ddd, yet this was huge. Otherwise, it was a beautiful dress."
3.0,"Hurt my ears, but my daughter loves hers."
3.0,"It is very lovely. I like the way that it fits and flows.  I love the rich color and the embroidery.  But when I washed it, it shrunk to mid calf."
3.0,Run a size small. Size chart is not accurate.
3.0,The top is smaller than I expected. ..oh well...keep cycling until it fits better! 😊
3.0,"Not as nice as I had hoped, but still gave it as a gift."
3.0,"They're too big for my face, but they're sunglasses so I'll wear em."
3.0,Returned. Very uncomfortable!
3.0,I bought this for.myself to use however when it arrived I found that it is for a child to wear. Very nicely made will look good on.my grandson
3.0,These are way bigger than I thought they'd be. They stick out very far from your ears. I doubt these will do anything but sit in my jewelry box...
3.0,"I ordered a size up and it's still a little small. Not a sweatshirt material at all, more like a shirt.<br />I like the print though."
3.0,THIS WATCH WAS OK  THE COLOR IS NOT DESERT IT WAS MORE OF OFF WHITE I WAS LOOKIN FOR MORE OF A BEIGE COLOR SO I RETURNED IT
3.0,The rhinestone pair arrived broken :(<br />The pair I chose to wear fit fine but the other ones ran small.
3.0,"Nice item, but did NOT come with the blue velvet bag as pictured. This was a gift for my daughters teenage friend and she had to give it to her in the cheap plastic bag it was shipped in. Not classy at all. Wouldn't have ordered if I had known it was not suitable for gift giving. Otherwise, nice bracelet, if you're not giving as a gift."
3.0,I'm sending it back because I felt like the fabric was a little close fitting for me. The fabric was soft and dress was pretty but not just right for me.
3.0,8/40 don't work.  I could live with one or two but a 20% failure rate is awful high.  Looking forward to playing with them this summer.
3.0,I ordered 2 pairs one a 10 girls too little 1 a 6 toddler too big sizing is not accurate
3.0,Luv the bracelete . i jus wish it could of lasted longer.
3.0,"I do like that my glasses don't fog.<br /><br />I don't like the pull on my under eyes. I don't like that it has to be placed on the outside of the mask, which if you have cute masks, 'ruins' the effect. It doesn't allow much flexibility for shorter mask uses.<br /><br />It works great if you don't talk much or have to wear masks for longer hours."
3.0,"Pattern looked totally different than picture so that made it look funny when wearing, didn't look like picture but fit."
3.0,"No pockets, so I was extremely disappointed."
3.0,"The arms were to short for my husband, 6'1"". When we tried to exchange it the return shipping was half the price of the product. Might as well just hand it down to someone else for that loss."
3.0,Be careful with silk shirts. It's easy to forget how delicate they are. They should come with a list of what not to do in them. Like walking in the rain.
3.0,"The colors are pretty. I usually wear a medium. I order a large, the large was too tight I needed an x-large"
3.0,This top is ok.  Strange material and sleeves were a challenge. Not a good top for big chests.
3.0,The dress looks a lot different in person. The models dress looked almost slightly sheer and light. The pattern is the same but the fabric isn't. It's like a stiff material that was cut from a simple straight pattern. I even bought a different one and they just are not what I was expecting.
3.0,The watch is nice but is hard to maintain it on time.
3.0,Got this set during a promo so for the price I’m ok with what I got. The top is cute. The bottoms remind me of bloomers so I’m not a fan of them. I sized up cause I wanted the top to be bigger but the bottoms are too big. This set runs true to size.
3.0,Cute shirt but fits smaller than expected
3.0,"I have a bighead 24"" and it was tight on me.  I wore it maybe twice and will not wear it again. :("
3.0,"Being a plus sized girl as I am, I was excited to receive the dress in the mail. However the x-large barely fit my rib cage. I'm usually a 16-18 but it barely fit. Also the zipper is thin with the fabric and at first I thought it was going to break when I was trying to zip myself into it. It only went up half my back before I had help. So if you are looking for a dress for a large rib cage or just plus size in general, this x-large will barely fit. But if your smaller it will be a great dress for the price. :)"
3.0,The bottom does not stay down rises up in the back have to keep pulling it down
3.0,It’s cute but still runs big. I got the small and it’s still too loose and moves around too much. Wish it was tighter
3.0,"little flimsy, but I use it only at school during duty"
3.0,Alittle tight in the crotch area otherwise my son loves them
3.0,The feel is wonderful and well made but baggy. Unfortunately the waist isn’t as big as the rest of it so clearly buying a smaller size would likely be too tight in the waist but better fit otherwise. I don’t understand sizing anymore!  I’ll keep them because they are comfy but won’t step out the door in them!
3.0,Just so so. Not the greatest but they function well.
3.0,"I wanted to like this I really did but it was just way too tight in the bust area, I am a DD and 5'11&#34; tall and this dress is obviously made for a much smaller frame then mine. I will not be ordering again."
3.0,"This is really cute, but the picture is very small...you need a magnifying glass to see what the actual picture is, though, even if it's under bright light.  I ordered a different one that  you can clearly tell is a mermaid.  But it does hold up with many showers and doesn't turn green."
3.0,Cute but run smaller than expected
3.0,"looks a little plastic-y, but with the right dress and side accessories, not bad at all for the price"
3.0,It's kinda itchy.. Not sure if that's normal as it's my first petticoat skirt
3.0,The material of this bra is very soft and band is wide without being thick. I purchased a medium and my bra size is 34DDD (F/G). I'm still pregnant so have not used it for nursing yet. My only complaint/discomfort is how high the bra comes up in the back. It's like a very high sports bra that touches the base of my neck and is really awkward and uncomfortable. For previous pregnancies I have used a different brand for sleep bras with a different style.
3.0,These ties looked very nice I had slim ties before but these were littlary too thin. Since it was so thin it looked dumb if you would wear it. The width of the tie was 2-3 pen wide for a grown adult I recommend not to wear it maybe a teenager should.
3.0,"They fit like yoga pants. I'm curvy and after reading a review that said these were great for curvy girls, I was sold. I got the green pinstripe ones. I love the color, but they don't fit well. I can definitely see a slimmer woman rocking these, but my big booty doesn't look good in these. My main issue is with the front though. They're not too tight, but they fit my curves a little too closely and it feels too revealing in the front. Also, these pants were a good 5'' longer than what I usually wear--granted, I am petite.<br /><br />I got a medium and they fit just fine. It's the style of the fit that I can't deal with. Will be returning."
3.0,"So I have a pair of the same brand and I love them! I thought I had lost my mittens and I was really sad cause they make my workouts easier to do and feel great on my hands, anyways, I decided to buy a new pair from the same brand, I picked these, but these are not the same, their really tight, and they must be for children feet and hands, cause I have the smallest feet and hands for an adult, but they still feel super tight and hurt sometimes. Especially the gloves, the rubber part of it, hurt my palms when working out. They dig into my skin making indents. The other ones I have do not do this. Luckily I found my other gloves and only use these when the other ones are dirty. For the price it's not worth it. They feel like they cut the circulation off of you."
3.0,When I received this the shape wasn’t as attractive and the fabric was stiff and not soft
3.0,"Made sturdy. Doesn't get dirty quickly, which is a plus. However, color is definitely not as described. Not the cute pink tone at all, actually a very unattractive shade of pink. Daughter ended up not liking them so we gave them to a friend. If you're looking to purchase for a good fit and a well put together shoe, go for it. If you're buying for color, don't."
3.0,"I bought this as my Halloween costume, but was a little disappointed that it didn’t look quite like the picture. It is a bit more “costume” looking so it ended up working out ok. Just not quite what I was looking for."
3.0,Overall not impressed. Have to use more than 3 coats to make my magnetic lashes stick. Not worth the money
3.0,It fits fine! The problem is that it's thin and transparent!! I'll never wear it!
3.0,They seemed a bit stertched
3.0,Nice but the strap to tighten broke after using it for a couple weeks
3.0,This was cute but overall I didn’t like it
3.0,"Ordered size 18.  Tight around the butt on 10yo, 6 inches too long."
3.0,REGULAR USE!
3.0,"never worn. came after I needed it. I didn't like the fabric, rough."
3.0,"I liked the bag, but the strap broke the first time I used it.  I read this in another review, but took the chance.  Returned the bag."
3.0,Got these for husband for Christmas and already worn out
3.0,"This cover up looks nice, but it’s not great material<br />The fabric is not towel like so it does not help with absorbing water<br />It keeps them warm but it is a little harsh"
3.0,Los brazos y las piernas del corazón se cayeron a la semana de tenerlo
3.0,"The only thing that I did not like about this item was that the headband was not strong enough. I have thicker hair so it didn't stay on too good, but other than that I think it's super cute. I would get it again and I will just  put like some barrettes or bobby pins to secure it in place"
3.0,"I bought these at CVS for my daughter and myself. They hold your hair just fine for leisurely activities, but they still leave creases in our fine hair."
3.0,"quality of swim suite is good, cute design, but too small for my 9yr old daughter."
3.0,"Cute color. Soft. Pleased with style...not pleased with sizing....Got a small and it was way too small in shoulders and chest. I’m 34C and muscular build. I bought the sweater from this site when there was a deal on it and wanted to do an even exchange for a M however, an exchange does not seem possible. Disappointed. I suppose that I will just return and not purchase again."
3.0,Too much boning - i gave it to my sister
3.0,Can't wear with his glasses
3.0,I really appreciate the 'ridge' that goes behind the ankle - I've found nothing else that does that and it is exactly what I need to hold my heel in the shoe. Down side - the glue doesn't hold. Within a couple of wearings it's sliding out.
3.0,I was not satisfied with this product. I does not look anything at all like the picture.
3.0,"The dress is well made but the size was humongous,  it was way too big."
3.0,The sleeves where really tight on me.
3.0,top was the correct size of 0-3 months but the pants were a size 3!!! smart packager!! cant wear the two together!!!
3.0,"More of a boatneck style, not off the shoulder. Sleeves were barely long enough and it was too tight at the bottom. The body was loose but then got more narrow towards the bottom hem. I really wanted to like this, the fabric was not too thin, like a light sweatshirt. I also liked that the stripes lined up correctly on the sides but the fit was not good!"
3.0,"leverback is too thin, must be very careful when hooking."
3.0,This keeps me warm at night and I suggested it to my friends
3.0,I ordered these for my 9 year old. They were not even close. They are literally like an infant size.
3.0,Really it just makes you sweaty.
3.0,On of the snaps broke the second day I wore it.
3.0,"After reading the other reviews here, I bought a size 4-6 for my regularly size 2-3T toddler. I'm glad I did because it definitely runs really small. If she grows a little, the 4-6 won't even fit her! Plus the seem popped I. The shoulder area after 1 wear and 1 wash. I had to stitch it up myself because it wasn't worth the hassle of returning."
3.0,Looked good when I got it but the aqua/ mint blue was actually baby blue in person. So the color in the photo was deceiving.
3.0,"This is a nice, warm, chunky sweater. I keep it in my office for cold days. However, the cut isn't flattering at all---it's boxy and the arms are puffy, so it adds a lot of bulk even beyond being such a thick sweater. One of the pockets is peeling off because it wasn't stitched down properly, so I need to find a sewing kit and hope that's the only problem.<br /><br />Overall, it's a warm if not particularly flattering sweater. I notice the price has increased since I ordered it; at the current price I would probably keep looking."
3.0,"Got my nipples pierced in October, so the swelling is down. These bars are very short and pinched my nipples so I can’t wear them :( super cute if you have tiny nipples lol"
3.0,OK. Not how it looks in picture
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he broke it within a week of getting it, it looks really nice but he says it broke so easily."
3.0,"The shirt is really pretty. My only warning is that it is not grey like it states, but rather a very soft lavender purple. It till works well for my wardrobe. But it was not the color I was expecting."
3.0,"If this is a low V....it didn't even come within 5"" of my bra.  Like a really short V neck.  This is not what I ordered.  The XL was HUGE.  More like a 3x.  Have a smaller one coming, we'll see..."
3.0,"Fabric is a bit thin and it runs small (hugs all your curves). I'd suggest sizing up if in between sizes. I got a size small and I'm 5'2"" and 110lbs. It's a cute style but I wish it was higher quality."
3.0,The red bow came off prior to receiving the item. Wasn’t a big deal for me - I got it for a reindeer costume for Halloween. However if I got it for Xmas photos I would be annoyed.
3.0,See thru n cheap
3.0,I ordered this sandal for son to go vacation when it arrived it was so small
3.0,"I wanted to love this so much. It looked like the perfect shirt that I was wanting to wear to more formal get togethers and to work. Unfortunately, it was far too short in length and I could only wear it with extremely high waisted pants. The sides would come up to the smallest point in my waist, which is just over my belly button. The shirt fit perfectly everywhere else, so I'm really disappointed it fit me so poorly.<br />For reference, I am 5'7, but most of my height is in my legs, not my torso."
3.0,It cool
3.0,Product is slightly smaller than expected. I am a true to size UD 22/24 and i bought the 3xl but it fits like a 2xl. Material quality is as described - light weight. Not see through but not thick either. Fair enough for the price.
3.0,The color is not true to what is shown.
3.0,Not exactly what I expected.
3.0,Solid but paint is too pale
3.0,"They work ok, but not great. They tend to slip off the frame tips. They would be ok for bigger frames."
3.0,Nice set of earrings that go with a lot of my night outfits. It makes a plain outfit pop with the cute dressy earrings. The white hoop fan earrings weren’t so nice. Looks cheap and it doesn’t stay straight. My favorite one are the green and black tassels.
3.0,The box is better than this glass
3.0,"The quality is very poor. The very first time I used it, the inside zipper burst and it wasn't even filled with a lot of clothing."
3.0,Extremely cute but the butterfly on the Side fell off & it broke within 4 weeks. I only gave it 3 stars because it's cute & I love butterflies. Also it fits reeealllllyyy big if you have a small wrist like me.
3.0,"It fits very nicely, but it is far too short.. ):"
3.0,I was a little bummed because I saw high ratings. I suppose I had unreasonably high expectations. The bags worked as advertised and I could comfortably fit two pieces within it for the wash. Unfortunately after the wash I noticed that the lint caught within the bag and then soiled my undergarments more than I had expected. I ended up having to rewash my items by hand in a sink to get all of the lint and debris off. Generally speaking they work fairly well however I wouldn't rush to repurchase
3.0,"Nice and comfy, color faded on first washed."
3.0,"The description says cropped, but based on the photo my wife expected it to be long enough to cover her belly button. This sweatshirt is much more cropped than shown. The fabric and texture is really interesting and this item could be good for someone much shorter or younger."
3.0,"The dress looked great, fit well and was a better quality material than expected, but unfortunately the seam with the zipper was open, looked like the sewing machine completely missed that seam"
3.0,"It's a cute piece of costume jewelry, but I have a hard time keeping the chains from tangling throughout the day."
3.0,Item was delivered more less on time and was much smaller than depicted in picture. Worth the money but not as comparable to a real Pandora charm.
3.0,There was a lit but they were cheaply made.
3.0,"Loved this and came as is but it fit like a &#34;one size&#34; product. I got my correct size from the measurement chart, however fit way smaller."
3.0,"Great color and design, soft fabric, but way too small even though followed size chart and went larger."
3.0,I love the look of this dress but if you have a butt at all it is not the dress for you.  I typically wear size 16 and a dress I ordered for me fits my size 6 family member instead.  It fit my bust but NOT MADE FOR A BUTT.  I would have shown all the goodies.  Wish the under skirt was longer because it truly is a beautiful dress.
3.0,Much darker than I wanted Just a shade off black  I need it now so don't have time to return it!
3.0,litte big
3.0,Would be 5 star if I got the color I actually ordered but it still fits nice
3.0,beautiful purse - not a briefcase - too small
3.0,Tight and clingy - not for me.
3.0,"These boots are very cheaply made, no support and not sure if they are real leather."
3.0,These are super cute but the top doesn't stay put they tend to roll down a lot.
3.0,"In their picture, this dress has a cinched waist. When it arrived, the dress had a completely different cut: no waist, all swing. Not at all what I expected. I returned it."
3.0,My son swims in high school and they have only lasted from Christmas to January 17. The clip on the back broke and now they don’t hold closed.
3.0,Small o rings snaps together very well and opens easily great value
3.0,I bought two of these in different colors. The cut was not flattering at all. It made me feel very frumpy. The make and materials was of good quality. Just didn’t work for me
3.0,"The style looked nice online but when I tried it on,  I found that the fabric was very stiff and scratchy. Not a comfortable fit."
3.0,"El vestido esta bonito pero mal confeccionado, estrecho arriba y muy ancho abajo y sin forma"
3.0,"Two years or more I ordered these pants.  They were great.  I ordered a couple more colors and had to send them back, too small.  I decided to try again and this time the blue ones are too short and the grey quite tight and I've lost 25 lbs.  Same pants but different colors and yet they fit quite differently."
3.0,"The price was certainly good, but the chain is too stiff and does not rest evenly across the tie. Spend the extra and you'll be happier."
3.0,"color is nice and it washes well in the machine.  I wanted an apron that did not go around the back of my neck, as I cook a lot and was getting neck pain.  This apron did prevent this.  I would have given it a higher rating, but for the fact that you have to cross the straps, insert on opposite sides of apron and then manage to slip your arms through.  It was a bit confusing,.  I am not a small person.and perhaps not as well coordinated as you may be. . To me the straps should have been longer.  After inserting the straps, I ended up knotting the ends to prevent them from coming out when putting the apron on.  I am getting better at putting it on and, even though not too thick of a fabric, it works  well and keeps my clothes clean."
3.0,"This was supposed to be a longer, mid calf length.  It barely comes to my knees and I'm average heighth at 5' 4"" .  It's okay but not as comfortable as I expected."
3.0,"This is a cute dress with a flattering cut and neckline. Nice fabric (no slip needed). However, the waist did not sit at a comfortable place on me. Returned item."
3.0,"I’m 5’10”, 185lbs, I wear a normal suit jacket 40 reg for a fitted look. This large is a little loose in the body(you may like that?) but the sleeves are about 2” to long.  I should have gone with the Med. The  material is not your normal suit jacket material but is very velvety and sporty. May return..."
3.0,It's made kind of flimsy there was a lot of extra thread hanging off that I need to cut I don't think it will hold up long maybe a couple uses at the most the stockings were in terrible condition I'm hoping I can at least wear them one time . The underwear look huge the have to probably be replaced with something else otherwise the material looks very stretchy I haven't tried it on but I'm sure it will fit . For the price it's a good deal I only paid $5.99 so I wasn't expecting anything that would be top-of-the-line . But I guess you get what you pay for and I really shouldn't complain but I'm only giving it three stars because I don't want people to think that this is something that is well-made and will hold up for a long time . It's just not made that well . Also it is very see-through there's nothing left for the imagination I'm hoping the bra part will fit because I am a triple D is long as I can get one or two uses out of it I'll be happy .
3.0,The shades clipped on my glasses easily and provided a strong sunscreen. I just felt there was a noticeable loss of clarity. Not enough that I won't use them. Works fine in bright sunlight. I was just used to prescription sunglasses before and so the clarity is similar to to cheap drug store sun glasses.
3.0,The swirls are more silver than white (Black Yun Design).  After 4 weeks of wearing the silver is rubbing off and the pattern is hard to see.  The band is very comfortable and with the buckle the Gear Fit2 stays safely on my wrist.  If the design had stayed on the band I would have rated higher.
3.0,Can't wear it and can't return it.  Not a good deal.
3.0,These are so pretty and cozy. Can wear them inside or out. Going to order another pr. They run big. Ordered 7/8. They fit like 8/10.
3.0,I should have looked more carefully at the size. I know someone who may like them. Otherwise I will have to send them back.
3.0,"Fit well and as described. Material of the shirt was cheap and the stitching along the bottom of the shirt frayed after wearing for one day, washing it just made it worse. Good for a one time use purpose but that's all."
3.0,"This is more of a bathing suit cover up than a top. The material is super sheer. Also, it runs very small. I recommend buying at least a size larger. The quality is good though and it's still very cute."
3.0,It's a cute outfit but you can't choose a size lol they just send u whatever random size they want
3.0,"MEASURE YOUR EAR before you buy this! Make sure it will FIT!<br /><br />Even so, I'm not an ear expert, but I do feel like this is a bit small for the average ear! So disappointing, as I've been looking at this thing for a while. Finally bought it and was excited to try it on once received, only to find that the only way to get this to work for me would be to re-pierce one of my (now closed) higher piercing holes!<br /><br />Because of the curve at the top and the piercing stem at the bottom, I feel like this must be a pretty specific fit: too small of an ear would have it floating awkwardly at the top, too big of an ear will have your lobe stretched out to the side at an odd angle and look ridiculous!<br /><br />The item itself is solidly constructed metal and seems to be nice quality. The stem does seem like it might slide a bit too easily out of the tail bit, which might be a consideration if you're the type to lose ear-backs, but I do think that this would be pretty neat for anyone who has the right sized ear to wear it!"
3.0,Nice synthetic fabric
3.0,One broke. Bought another pair and one came crooked.
3.0,Does not fit like xxl but more like l-xl
3.0,"Nice shorts, I ordered Large and receives small.  Would like to return"
3.0,"The picture of this tunic shows a flowy bottom, which it is not. It has a regular shirt tail bottom. The color and fit are great. It’s just not as pictured. I kept it, it is also very thin and lightweight."
3.0,This was for a Tea Party
3.0,Product runs small in my book. Nice shirt just too small.
3.0,Support is great and you’ll find good arches and gel cushioned heels.  The style is nice and you can also slip on without using your hands. Unfortunately the hard plastic used in the insoles to provide structure rubs against the inner base of the shoe causing excessive and comical squeaks with each and every step.  There’s not much ventilation either so prepare for sweaty feet.
3.0,Still can't believe I got this brand for 3 dollars lmaoo
3.0,"It doesn't hold tight, belt itself is good"
3.0,It's a bit long so you will need to wear this with a belt if you are short like me (5'4&#34;).
3.0,"Nice top, bad smell though, hope it washes out"
3.0,Bought these for a Xmas gift but sent them right back because the quality just wasn’t there for the price.
3.0,"Good fit but had to re stitch heal area on one of them.<br />Got these for husband, won't be buying myself a pair  : (<br />Mr. Alan j<br />You got my review wrong in your respond . I did not say the size was wrong....the stitching came loose. Grrrr"
3.0,The fabric got easily look like it was worn out. Picture is so much nicer.
3.0,I liked the color but I didn't like the material
3.0,Would’ve rated higher but they kept off. Backing was too loose but they were gorgeous on.
3.0,"Very cute ring, stone was small in my ring so wasn’t super obvious to view when it fell out within the first week. His stone was larger but lasted a couple weeks longer before it fell out. Rings are still in great shape and love the colors. Just don’t expect the stones to last."
3.0,Was a gif t
3.0,ordered a large and it fit like a 1x
3.0,It did fit except the top was super awkward to loose and my bra shows a lot .
3.0,"Thought this was for a right ear. Disappointed as I already have one for my left, but it is cool regardless."
3.0,The review that the strap comes off are oh so true.<br /><br />Other than that I did like this wallet and the size is handy if you don't need the strap.
3.0,"It was ok, not bad enough to return but not as nice as I'd hoped."
3.0,Nice quality but too short for my ugly knees
3.0,I was kind of disappointed after getting this silver charm bead. Not sure if I expected more but this was very tiny to use it as a necklace or even a bracelete. I originally bought it as a birthday gift for a friend but after receiving it I wasn't too happy but I still ended up giving it as a gift. I dont think she was too convinced. I have no idea how this fits in a bracelete but it can be inserted in a necklace as the charm has a hole in the middle. Overall this item itself isn't that bad however you need to consider the size. I have attached a picture of the charm for reference.
3.0,They are not the prettiest but they are confy
3.0,"for the price they more decently made than expected. A tad small in the front. Shaped like a V like the picture so if you are looking for a pair that goes straight across hips, these are not the ones you're looking for. Wish they made them another size bigger than it would be perfect, but they are comfortable enough. Definitely expect so show some booty if you are buying."
3.0,"Not large, will fit average adult. It's just not over-sized."
3.0,"They are a bit too tight, wish they had the same hold just not as tight."
3.0,Buy a larger size than you usually do
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" and they were just a little too short for me. The material is quite thick. They're not like most beach pants, although they look like they would be. The material is a bit heavier and thicker."
3.0,The pattern in the back of the dress is not matched at all taking away from the attentiveness of the dress. Use it around the house.
3.0,The printing job is high quality but the shirt itself is low quality
3.0,Low quality. Get what you pay for. Otherwise it’s beautiful
3.0,I liked these they look just like the picture and arrived on time. I did find them hard to get out of my ears after wearing them for awhile and I was not sure how to clean them. My boyfriend's said peroxide but they just turned a gray color after he did that.
3.0,"Cute overall, just need more lucrative in top...fits to lose if you want to dance"
3.0,They are not wide enough
3.0,This was very cute and fit as expected.  The only issue was the color didnt match.  It said and the picture looked like a dark red/maroon.  It is alot more purple.  I bought it for work since I have to wear red and it wont work for that.
3.0,Super cute but run a little small.  Ordered two sets thankfully they fit the smaller kid.
3.0,I wear large men's or xl women's and ordered xl. Sadly it was too small.
3.0,"Well made and very cute. But WAY too small. Ordered a 38D. Bra labelled ""38D"". More like a 32B. Made and marketed in China for Chinese women. This is not an American product. If you're willing to gamble on the size, it's a good product but order with care."
3.0,Lenses are extremely small
3.0,Really like these shoes but way to hard to put on. There isn't anything to help pull the shoe on.
3.0,They are nice but a little tight. Not as thick as the Gaiam is a great brand if you are looking for thick leggings with a cute outfit!
3.0,Make sure to pay attention to the words. Sent my child to school for crazy sock day in socks that say a bad word. Paid no attention to what they said since I was buying CHILD’s socks. The other pair in the pack are cute!
3.0,I was anticipating the actual size of a 1/2 in plug but it was smaller than the other ones I have. I'll deal with it because I have to but it will suck when I want to wear other ones.
3.0,"Fits the device fine, but it is not silver-more of a grayish tone, and it doesn’t polish up."
3.0,this product was great for keeping me from loosing my gotcha but it is a little clumbsy and the cord that comes with it is a little short on my neck (17&#34; neck) it was more like a choker all in all for the price i would have been nice to have a longer cord.<br />it is a little difficult to charge the gotcha but with this device there is a way to use it to securly hold you device in place so that it will charge it.
3.0,"Lot of compliments!<br /><br />Updated, it will turn color!"
3.0,Chain came very promptly. But I was a lil disappointed in the thickness of it. it appeared a lil bigger on computer. I hope it dont break too easy.
3.0,"The fir was fine, but I wasn’t thrilled with the colors of the leopard upper part of the shirt. The material looks more faded in person than the picture shows."
3.0,"This is a super cute sweatshirt and was well constructed. I loved the color. The sizing on it is very small. I ordered the XXL, which was the largest available. Like most products manufactured outside of the US it runs considerably small. The trunk and the arms were both cut narrow with very little room for stretch. I would say it fit closer to a standard US large. It would be my recommendation to order at least two sizes up. If it helps I have a 46&#34; chest and typically wear a 1x or 16/18 top in US sizes."
3.0,"The mask is supposed to be helpful for the deaf to see; However, it fogs up to the point that it is defeating the purpose altogether."
3.0,Looks cute but very uncomfortable
3.0,Cute shirt but the material was clinging and hugged my belly. It was very unflattering on me. Also the top was too loose while the middle and the bottom were too tight. It just didn’t work for my body type. For reference: I’m a size 16 and carry most of my weight in the middle. My bra size is a 38C.
3.0,looks well made but runs very small and doesn't cover neck as shown.  probably will return for one that is larger and longer
3.0,"It says baby boy shoes. I ordered a size 4 expecting them to fit my 14 month old. They came in he mail and they were large enough to nearly fit me.<br /><br />--update-- looking at size options, the &#34;little kid&#34; size ended at size 4 and the &#34;toddler size&#34; starts at size 5. My child wears a &#34;toddler&#34; size 4. Be sure to keep that in mind when ordering."
3.0,"Good product so far except for one thing. The magnetic clasp results in a useless compass feature in my Amazfit Bip. Probably would effect all smart watches with a compass feature. The strap is also a little short, so if you have a large hand, the watch may be difficult if not impossible to put on."
3.0,"The pants are okay, but there's a band at the top of the control top area that is much tighter than the rest.  It makes it uncomfortable to sit or move around.  The fabric is nice and soft.  Nice stretch and length on the legs.<br />I returned the pants."
3.0,This was return not my style
3.0,Was A Little Tighter Than Expected. Thought The Material Would've Been More Professional.
3.0,"This is cute, but the sizing is off. The color grey is attractive and the material is thick.  I own many PatttBoutik tops and love them. If purchasing, I recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,These are okay. My ears are sensitive but tolerated these fine. My only complaint is that after about a month of wear several of the little crystals popped off.
3.0,"A little disappointed that this dress doesnt hit the ground, bought this for a trip. Im 5'7 and half, 286lbs. I am top heavy and bottom heavy. I purchased a 3X and it looked like a trash bad on me, it was also about 2 to 3 inches ABOVE my ankle. I could have went down maybe 2 sizes and still had room. I expected long and flowing and got short and baggy. I sent it back. If you're tall, dont bother."
3.0,"I am 155lb, 5&#34;6 tall,38dd cup, i got an XL blouse and is so big so i can fit two like me together...I wish they would put a picture to show from every side and with arms extended...I can not say any thing about the quality,because i can not wear it.I will see if i can make it smaller or return.But it came very quickly.We needed more information about the size..."
3.0,tight around throat
3.0,The only problem with this suit is the shoulder part is very loose and slides off very easily. If the lining was a bit tighter this bathing suit would be perfect
3.0,My wife laughed at me when this came in the mail. I'm going to force her to wear it in public a few times.
3.0,Bought this pair and the dark denim. The dark blue ones fits me perfectly. No belt needed and no constant need to pull my pants up on my hips. The light blue pair is a mess! They are too tight which is weird because I bought both in medium. I am 5'10 and 160 pounds. I normally fit a size 7 or 8. I must have gotten a bad batch or something. Overall the dark blue ones are nice.
3.0,Only one fit properly the are all different size’s
3.0,Dress looks cute but I was sent the wrong size completely.
3.0,"Very cute dress, fits well with a jean jacket. I'm a little disappointed that stitching at the lower seam had some puckering going on there. But that's an easy fix.  Overall it fits comfortably.  I'm size 14 and ordered 2XL."
3.0,Buckle broke after about 2 years. Other than that OK.
3.0,"Pretty desgin and the bottoms fit well, but the top had a weird shape and was loose in weird places. I ultimately returned it because I didnt like the way it ties on the shoulders - ties are too long and I couldnt get it to tie cute."
3.0,They satisfy my needs
3.0,It fits ok and very cute as it is from the item description
3.0,"Very light material, not long , reaches above ankles and height is 5.9  I bought 4 of the colors and only the black one was true in material. Very disappointing"
3.0,A little big for me.  But my neck is thin. I never wear these anymore m
3.0,Its super cute but mine came in broke! Opened the package and the beads spilled out everywhere and the string was snapped in the middle
3.0,"After a few weeks of consistent wearing, the swoosh emblem has already came off. I know these headbands are notorious for this, but it<br />still shouldn't happen."
3.0,The fabric is very dull. Looks like it’s been washed and is old.
3.0,Sucks they don't come in more sizes. Other than that they are amazing and fit &#34;me&#34; personally. But if you have a thicker neck chances are they won't fit you.
3.0,I've had this watch for at least half a year and I've enjoyed it for the most part.<br />Pros:<br />- Analog and Digital<br />- Day of week and Date displayed on face<br />- Good Backlight<br />- Takes a beating<br />Cons:<br />- Had to go to a jewelers to get it fitted<br />- Not very comfortable for those with smaller wrists<br />- You have to set the analog and digital parts separately which can be a pain if you want them to exactly match
3.0,I must have misread the measurements because I wasn't expecting the earrings to be super tiny . Other than that they're nice looking
3.0,General look and feel is quite good. But 1) the red is not the same red as online; 2) runs smallish which is not OK for my arms. Therefor I am returning it.
3.0,"Like the look and feel. The toe box is a bit tight and I have average-narrow feet. The sizing feels true.<br />I was offered these shoes at a discount in exchange for an honest review - which has to be done within 10-days, so I am going to wear these a little more in the upcoming weeks and amend the review if my impressions change."
3.0,The nose piece was broke when they arrived and I had to super glue it back on.
3.0,"Thin and weird fabric, but our daughter loves them and they’ve held up to a few washes. They are more of a dress up item at our house rather than normal wear."
3.0,These have a strong seam up the middle which makes them look kinda weird & after not too long the metal in the nose piece starts sticking out of the fabric. Not terrible but not great
3.0,"Bought a 3X because I like my sweatshirts on the big side and the sizing is for sure on the small side. Did not end up being on the big side and while it fit and was still comfortable, I think it would have shrunk after washing and just been too much on the small side.  Bummer because it was cute!"
3.0,runs small buy 1 size up from what you normally wear
3.0,First day I used it was today . Beautiful color The 3x isn’t even close to covering entire boob or even full Nipple  area if your ddd size up  . The material feels nice looks nice but feels like it’s gonna rip would been happier in one size up .
3.0,"These are not clip on sunglasses. They are a pair of clear lenses with magnetic polarized lenses. I don't really know what to do with them. You can wear them as sunglasses, but the clear lenses??? They don't truly have any immediately evident purpose. I wear prescription glasses and I was hoping to use them in conjunction with them. Unfortunately they don't work with my glasses."
3.0,Was way too low for me . Just not a good fit. Quality was fine. I liked that. Just didn’t work for me.
3.0,"I just received this today....its a beautful crosssbody bag, leather is definitely supple and with a quality thickness.  No breaking in the leather stiff feeling here.  Detailing is awesome.  My one issue is as far as advertising it being a concealment bag, there should be more in the description about it.  It has a small kind of half pocket the size youd fit your larger cell phone in with a small black elastc type strap inside which my geuss is to put the front of your gun in and leaving the complete handle exposed.  My  Ruger LCP slid right out the strap was too loose...now the smith n wesson 38 hammerless is in it but of course the handle is completely exposed when I unzip the top.  Im used to a completely concealed area for my gun.  This will take some getting used to and I will try because it is such a pretty bag."
3.0,"Some are too big, some are super tight. I do like the way they look, but the sizing being all over the board is too much to ignore."
3.0,"Comfortable but disappointed with the pocket situation. Zipper on front is not a pocket, just for show, other pockets don't accept easy access to hands, only entry to them is from button top."
3.0,I like the packaging - but stiffing? Meh. Barely holds the shape - 100% of the time the hats revert to their pre Bickmore shapes.
3.0,"I am giving this a 3 star review bc within 48 hours my 18 month old has already managed to lose this earring. She can’t take it off herself so obviously the back came unscrewed. It was pretty secure when I put it on. That’s pretty disappointing considering the point of the screw on back is to keep my child from losing the earring. Other than that the quality is decent and it was exactly what I was expecting, minus the back coming loose."
3.0,This isn’t for big booby girls. I’m barely a D cup and I was falling out the top. And the hearts will fall off. Had to get iron ons to get a better result.
3.0,"Cute, looks like photo. I don't like the fact the balls make a rattle noise like a baby rattle. Also, clip is very small"
3.0,"I don't care for the shape of the brim or the height of the cap, so I will probably never wear it."
3.0,Pretty but HUGE AND HEAVY
3.0,"A good, sturdy piece. Downside is you are given very cheaply made tools to change the size. Tool broke quickly and had an awful time trying to fix it. Otherwise great"
3.0,"I think they are super cute to wear out, lots of compliments but they are a bit uncomfortable to wear after a while of use. Kinda not worth it but definitely a nice look."
3.0,This fits my body like a dream. love the fit
3.0,"While the product is honest, it should have come more prepared for assembly. I paid 130 dollars for this and it does not have any sort of parts on the mask pieces to fit into each other and no easy spot for a strap to be glued. I can make this work but it needs some polishing."
3.0,Good fit & cute dress but see through!
3.0,I have to admit I was disappointed by these. I expected a bit more high quality of a product than I received. Immediately upon unwrapping I could tell the materials were not genuine. I also have very sensitive piercings so I typically only buy higher quality earrings. These earrings irritated my ears within minutes. The packaging was great and they appeared to be shipped with care.
3.0,Cheap dress. Good for the money.
3.0,The material is pretty thin and see through. It has these weird triangle seams on each side that stick out like wings. I’d skip it!
3.0,"These boots are super cute and seem to be decent quality, but they are not waterproof.  Bought 2 pairs for my kids and both had wet feet after playing in the snow for an hour."
3.0,"Shirt does not have sleeves as pictured more like a cap sleeve, hardly any fabric there. Does not come down as long as picture either and lace is only on the front side which looks stupid. Another attempt at a work outfit that ended up being a working around the house top. This is not an A line Plus Sized Tunic."
3.0,"As a cross body purse this is a nice purse. But when I put my gun in the pouch, there is not much room for anything else in the center pocket of the purse. Getting just my wallet in and out was a struggle. There is no holster nor Velcro to hold my holster. When drawing the gun out, the pocket turns wrong side out. Not really what I had expected. The purse arrived quickly and seller agreed to let me return it as long as it was still new and had the tag. Cost me $6.00 return postage. I will be looking more closely to be sure the item can be returned with an Amazon label that I can print."
3.0,"This set of stick on bras is ok. I do like the idea behind it but falls a little short in the execution. I like that it has a lifting ability, but the overall cover is so big. But if it weren’t big, it probably wouldn’t be effective in lifting so I can see why the design is so big. The bunny ears are also pretty big. It’s useful if you’re wearing something with a pretty high neckline, otherwise the “bunny ears” will definitely show. You’re able to snip the “ears” so they’re shorter, but then they lose the lifting ability. You also need to be careful when taking the covers off. I’m worried that with constantly pulling, it could put too much stress on your chest and cause premature sagging. Overall, I think it’s a good option but for limited applicability and occasional use."
3.0,Liked the quality but the flare was too large to get them in my ears. I have been 0 for almost a year.
3.0,Just make me look very wide.  Because of how pockets are places. I’m 5’6 160 ordered a large not  flattering to an hour glass shape. I have wide hips
3.0,"The material is thin and if I wasnt on a time crunch for it to arrive before Christmas, I would have purchased from wish app for a fraction of the cost.  It's for my 10 year daughter who will LOVE it, which is all that truly matters.  But keep in mind, this is just not a good jacket for warmth"
3.0,"I needed a small but it fits like a medium which is disappointing bc I really like the shirt, so now I use it as a night shirt. It gets softer as you wash it. It's cute, I wish it fit better."
3.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas because she wanted one so badly.  It's fine for her, but the quality isn't that great and it's almost impossible to open."
3.0,Definitely needed a size smaller
3.0,I had another brand on these witch hats and the quality was great. I ordered this one and it was super thin and cheaply made.
3.0,Typical wear and zipper broke after three months. Not to mention that there is no strap to keep the inside sleeve attached to the outer sleeve.
3.0,It fits tight across the bust. Love the material its made of.very lightweight
3.0,"They're relatively cheap, which is a good thing since they wear out rather fast. My last pair lasted two months before the lining separated. It's cheaper to keep buying more of these than to experiment with other brands, many of which are more expensive and don't last even this long."
3.0,Its cool.i get compliments everywhere I go 🙃
3.0,"Adorable earrings. I bought two sets so she could have to letters and two regular studs, I wish they came with two of each but they were cheap enough I bought two."
3.0,Its a cute dress
3.0,Beautiful and not at all flimsy but will turn your finger green. If you do the usual coating with clear nail polish it works out alright. Other than that it's well sized and detailed. Looks just like the advert.
3.0,"These are Ok, but they run VERY Small! I ordered medium and large...and got medium and X large...thank god the Xlarge barely fit so i kept them .But just so you know they run Very Small"
3.0,"Loved the dress, but needed about 2-3 more inches to make it work (I'm 5'9"").  Returned it."
3.0,"Nice quality for the price but is run bigger than I expected,  I am 5&#34; tall and 100 lbs."
3.0,"Although it has a good look, it's not quite what it claims to be; it is not the jacket the look is trying to suggest.  Even the front 'flap' pockets -- only one is real; the other is just a flap, with no pocket under it, and not even another side to the button, so it can't be buttoned down.  The zipped pocket on the front?  Nope; just a zipper -- nothing behind it.<br /><br />It isn't bad, as a generic windbreaker, and it does have a nice look.. but it's not even close to what it appears to be."
3.0,They were nice just really really tight. I even sized up. I Had to return them.
3.0,"Great price. Bought black and burgundy pair.  First day of wear, ripped along leg seam"
3.0,I bought it to fit big but it fit small 🙃
3.0,Innovative
3.0,Pretty but fits small and is very short.
3.0,Need to have instructions on how to put clasp on overalls and size was bigger than expected
3.0,First of all they're smaller than I expected. They are cute though but unfortunately mine didn't last long. They are not strong. The stem that goes through your ears bends easily. Mine bent and then broke after just a few wears. It didn't last too long.
3.0,"Poor quality, seams sewn all wrinkled. Order smaller runs large"
3.0,"Okay support, a little small, no.padding"
3.0,"They're fantastic for adults with small heads- excellent noise control- but they are really tight and hard for smaller kids to put on.  My son likes it when I put them on him (sensory issues), but you really have to help a small person put them on."
3.0,"I ordered the smallest size and it's still too big. I'm 103lbs, 32DD and 5 Feet. I am returning this for a credit."
3.0,They were an ok size they turned my ears green tho over all they were cute
3.0,I tecieved it in about a week. The charm is pretty but not feeling the chain..looks like its tarnished. Wouldve been better if it was in silver instead of a blackish color..
3.0,"Fabric's a little stiff, Chinese sizes have shorter that their American counterparts. Didn't shrink in the wash."
3.0,Not a good shoe. Not soft and not much support. Better than some but not what I expected.
3.0,"Not as slouchy as picture, or expected."
3.0,I have a hard time clasping this neck wire as the clasp is twisted a strangely and it’s hard to get the lobster claw through the other end.  The look is OK but it appears a little cheap. Will probably give it away as a gift and will purchase from a different vendor.
3.0,"Pros: cotton is good; nice finish; seems well constructed; seems roomy enough.<br />Cons [subjective!]: waistband is a bit low and therefore not where I expect it, so it is uncomfortable -- of course it won't ride up!; fit at top of leg is a tad tighter than I want, so I am aware of it -- who needs to be aware of their underwear all day?; comes only in black and gray.<br />The cons might not be a problem for others, but are enough for me to want to return."
3.0,Material wasn’t as expected and kind of cheap
3.0,The Gold has a very shiny plastic look to it. Almost looks like a toy but besides that it's great
3.0,"It's a well made baby cap, but my lil girl is 4 months and wearing 3 month Sz, so I ordered 3-6 month Sz hat and it's too small. She doesn't have a huge head.. Disappointed"
3.0,"They run quite big, but they were inexpensive so didn't have high expectations."
3.0,"they are very cheape, they does'nt come with the pin to hold it in the ear."
3.0,Kinda small thought I had got the medium one …
3.0,The sunglasses part was so heavy on the frame that they kept slipping down.
3.0,"I got this dress as it looked amazing on the model in the picture. However, it appears to fit more like sleepwear on me. I am 5""6 175 Lbs and was not too pleased with the fit. The material is nice but I still don't know if I would fee comfortable wearing this out or more specifically for any occasion. I would say you should get this for winter time perhaps."
3.0,"For me the bra didn't work.  I think my chest is just too big.  There wasn't any &#34;side support&#34; for me.  I ordered a 38ddd which is what I normally wear, but the cups were too small. I wish it worked!  The search continues"
3.0,I was expecting cotton.
3.0,"I was drawn to this bracelet as the shape looks like an eye, and my daughter has a rare eye condition.  It is listed as “pink zirconia” though it’s not really pink.  The center gem looks like a white opal that reflects a rainbow of colors.  The clear stones are small but add a lot of sparkle.<br /><br />I was not impressed with the corded band on this bracelet.  It looks nice, but it is stiff and scratchy.  I also find that adjusting it is very difficult, especially when I am trying to tighten it on my wrist.  I was hoping it would loosen up after some use, but it hasn’t.<br /><br />The bracelet can fit a variety of sizes.  It is big enough that I can wear it as an ankle bracelet, but also can be made small enough to be worn on my wrist.  The excess strings are long when worn on the wrist, but it doesn’t really bother me.<br /><br />I’m rating this item 3 stars: it’s okay."
3.0,"I am a small woman and my hat size is average. In other words, I don't have a giant skull that needs a giant hoodie. That being said, I bought this travel pillow because I thought that the hoodie would give me a sense of privacy while sleeping (attempting to sleep) in a plane. I haven't worn it on the aircraft yet, but the hoodie, in my opinion, isn't long enough. I would like, at the least, an extra 1/2 inch or so of fabric on the sides. The pillow is okay, but rather hard. i will post a review after my seven hour flight. I think that this pillow is probably not what I was looking for."
3.0,Overall I like the shirt. The only thing I don't like is how the underarms come right up to the armpit.
3.0,By no means burgundy. Bright red. Also seems a big for a medium so I would order down a size.<br />If you're looking for plain red then this will be for you. Sadly I was wanting maroon/burgundy.
3.0,"At $12, this it's a decent value.  They're kind of cheap, but look decent.  I'm not sure how long these will hold up, but they're good for reading outside or in bright light."
3.0,Should have purchased the nose piece for the lenses as the original Oakley nose piece does not fit these lenses.
3.0,"it is a fun dress but poor quality ,good enough to use around the house"
3.0,"Cons:<br />It fits hugely!<br />The dress is super long in the back and short in the front; the dress look weird.<br />The keyhole goes super low.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Thin material, won't get hot during summer days.<br />ok pattern."
3.0,This is super cute but thankfully I dropped something before leaving my house. When I bent over to pick it up both boobs popped right out. I don’t have big boobs either. This happened again and again ever time I bent over just slightly. Thankfully I was able to switch swimsuits before I got into trouble out on the water.
3.0,"I love the material, but the size is way off."
3.0,Awesome product but gave three starts as they seemed a bit smaller than expected. Purchase an xl but couldn’t fit into it and I usually wear xl.
3.0,"Well made, looks nice, but not for a woman's wrist.  Stainless steel band looks good on an aluminum apple watch, a brushed finish.  Send it back, unfortunately not the best for a small woman's wrist (had removed 4 links).  Would recommend for men."
3.0,"I ordered two bracelets and they came in in the expected delivery time. I opened it up and I was pleased as they look exactly like the photo and it has nice coloring. However upon putting it on, the chain on the bracelet that keeps it on fell right off! So, I went to fix it and after I did, it just did it again. I was disappointed that it wouldn't stay together, but it's cute nonetheless."
3.0,It’s nice but it didn’t give the look I was going for
3.0,"Shirt is a good material, not too see through that you need an undershirt, just wear a nude bra.  Fit is tight and not as pictured.  Runs small.  Definitely size up if you are looking for something that fits like the pictures."
3.0,"Nice little gift, but runs real small.a"
3.0,The shades are so much lighter than the photograph.
3.0,The stone fell out some time after wearing it. It goes back in but is not straight and also falls out again if I wear it in the shower/pool. Hoping they fix this issue. It makes a really nice necklace!
3.0,Order a size down. Material is full of stretch
3.0,Nice bag.  The removable chain is heavy and the length is not adjustable.
3.0,"Short, but good fit.  I have an athletic build."
3.0,"Fabric wrinkles very easily. Ironed and within minutes they were back where the dress draped. Fits slightly snug. I followed the sizing guide to order my size, but the fabric does stretch... the low stars are for the maintenance of the fabric..."
3.0,"At first I loved these bras. They fit great and the pads are adjustable. But after a week of wearing them I got a rash and I realized that they are 100% synthetic material, which does not breathe and traps moisture against your skin. This is bad fabric for underwear (bras)! I will still use these for short term workouts, but I can't wear them to work. Now I get why underwear is always made of cotton. =("
3.0,"These are good quality, but they’re too big to wear as septum piercings. For reference, 8mm is snug for me and 10mm is a little loose, but these reach my lip. Also, they turn on their own, so it’s hard to keep them symmetrical."
3.0,"This dress fit ok, it just did not flatter my body type - short and round. It would like cute on someone thinner though. Quality of the fabric seemed nice enough and I didn't notice any obvious flaws in the dress."
3.0,great idea but i found i didn't need it while traveling for a month in japan.
3.0,"Got the wrong item. I wouldn’t have paid so much for Harry Potter. I work and come home to sleep. Returning it’s a time hassle. UPS by my job is for cargo distribution only. I suppose I’ll call from work and see if I have to pay a difference. Better than the trouble of returning it. I may be almost 59; but I outgrew HP. Stitch, not so much.<br /><br />Bummer. These are sturdy handbags. 👜 I really wanted Lilo & Stitch. But, human error. It could happen to anyone."
3.0,"Great compression socks.  I would rate them a 5, however, these are ""thick"" and since I am very hot natured, I am going to have to wait until it gets cold again to wear these.  They are super cute, and fit over my very fat calves."
3.0,Runs small.. but still cute..
3.0,"I really liked the top of this dress and it was very flattering. However, it was SO short on me. I'm only 5'4 so that's not usually an issue I have. There's no way I would have been able to bend over even slightly, so I returned :("
3.0,"They’re pretty cute but my very tall (98th percentile) 10 month old is swimming in them. They pull up to the very upper thigh and are pretty loose. They fall off easily (which was the whole point of me ordering knee socks — so they’d stay up). They’re also a bit lighter than I expected from the picture. However, they’re cute and the colors are useful and she’ll grow into them! They’ll definitely become useful."
3.0,"Fit a little snug, but that’s not the problem. Made hips look bigger, I’m short so doesn’t help. The pleading on the skirt was not what I expected in the front part. Was bummed  I had to return it."
3.0,"Runs a little big, seems is for someone tall.....also fabric is too hot."
3.0,Colors were true and the lady bugs are cute. I wear women's 7.5 and they fit well. The fabric is very thin. I can see my toes through it. I don't expect these to last long before getting holes.
3.0,"This dress runs VERY small. I am 5'9&#34;  size 8/10 and the XL was too short and tight in bust. Also, the color is not a wine but more of a red."
3.0,Products came on time and was as described. The reason I’m giving 3 stars is because I can’t wear them. They make me itch badly. I don’t have any allergies and can’t understand why. I’ve washed them twice to see if that would help but they still make me itch. Therefore I cannot wear them and they are useless to me. It’s too bad because I really like them.
3.0,They look awesome but the top is heavy so it hangs out partially (I got 1/2 inch) they look funny in your ear
3.0,Bigger than expected and also stiffer than expected.
3.0,"Extremely thin fabric (dont wear pantiea not even the invisible kind) and very high slit that moves around and goes where it shouldn't be, very loose straps that cause neckline to fall to the waist area. Otherwise very cute."
3.0,It could have been larger
3.0,Bought this as a gift for my grandmother for her to have at my wedding.  Love the little ladybugs on it - good quality embroidery.  Not overly thrilled with the actual material of the handkercheif though - kind of stiff & coarse.  Hopefully it will soften up with washing.  She loved it though!
3.0,Good shirt. shrunk in the wash though
3.0,"I loved the style of this watch and the feel of it. It totally looked like an expensive watch when it was on and people were always shocked to hear I had only paid $10 for it. However, I was not totally shocked when my $10 watch stopped ticking a few months later. The end of it was when the band just snapped off. I did wear it a lot and I definitely got my $10 worth. But if you are looking for a watch that will last you a long time, this is not it"
3.0,Charm is large!! For a bracelet charm most people would probably say it is too big. it is about an inch across at the widest point...when paired with other charms that measure 1/4 inch or so it absolutely dwarfs them...probably in the product description but you don't really realize it until you see it.
3.0,"The necklace itself is well made, the skull image however is poor quality and blurry."
3.0,"Cheap material, not as expected. Flowers are pretty tho."
3.0,"I do not like the material.  It is rough and scratchy.  I thought it would be kind of a knit, but it's something sort of - I can't even describe it.  The fit is very good, but it just won't be comfortable with this scratchy material.  That's my opinion.  Others may differ.  Thank you."
3.0,"These were bigger than the pips should be, and the edges are rounded over so they don't have the nice crisp appearance from the show."
3.0,The fabric and sizing is outstanding. Only thing wrong was the lettering on the back of the tee came in with a dark yellow hue instead of a crisp white font
3.0,"I initially bought these to use under my scrubs at work. The fabric was as expected, but the overall fit was disappointing. They fit oddly through the chest area, and the sleeves were that annoying 'just too short' length.<br />Wouldn't recommend."
3.0,"3 stars only because of the size variation.  I'm 5'9, 165 pounds and I couldn't finish my dinner out with friends as I was so uncomfortable (stuffed) in the outfit.  Maybe an XL or 2XL (which I will never ever order😉) would have been better."
3.0,"Nicely made but....<br />You need an extremely small waist to pull this over your hips. It's more of an &#34;over the head&#34; dress. Not made of a stretchy material at all. Also, the straps on this dress seemed like they were made for someone much taller so they are very long when I have this dress on my waist. I'm 5'3, 120lbs with about a 26-30&#34; waist (my hips are about 30&#34;). This seems to be made for someone taller and with a narrower waist. I ended up just cutting the straps off and using it as just a bottom."
3.0,If you have more than about 4 diopters of correction this lens probably will not fit over the edge of your prescription lenses. The edge of my prescription lens (4.75 diopters) is too thick for the edge claps on the sunglasses to fit over.
3.0,The only issue is that the color seems to fade or come off. I don't know if it's from the chlorine in the pool. But it looks great
3.0,"It's cute and I've been wearing it all winter, but it lost a snap the day after arrival, both of its main-closure zipper pull tabs in the weeks to follow and another button has come right out of the fabric housing since.<br /><br />Cheaply-made, not for long-term use or durability."
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, am a 42C, and weight about 180ish and it's a little bit tight on me."
3.0,"Hat came in the mail bent, I have to try to re shape it in order to wear it."
3.0,Super soft shirt but definitely runs big in size & is see through.
3.0,Expected more cushion for what I paid.
3.0,"I love maxi dresses for the summer.  I purchased the first dress in a medium.  I am 5'2"" 143 lbs.  I was extremely long.  I had in hemmed by a seamstress, still just a tad too long since I prefer to wear flat sandals.  I love the color but the cut makes me look fatter than I think I really am, lol.  I ordered another color in a small.  Have to say, I like the fit of the small more than the medium.  Again too long, had altered.  Just got them both back from the seamstress so I have not worn them yet.  Most of my long dresses are sleeveless and I were a shrug with them, so I anxious to try out these short sleeve dresses."
3.0,"I rated this down two star (to 3) for the following reasons:<br />1) nowhere in the sales info, or in the box it shipped in, is the battery size/type listed. The only way to find out was to actually take the watch apart, remove the back, and what we found was a cheap, no-name battery that didn't even have the size stamped on the battery case. We figured it as a 377 by comparing it in size and shape to a box of batteries we keep.<br />2) the watch is water resistant, not water proof. When we took it apart to check the battery, it wouldn't go back together and we thought we were going to have to purchase a watch press. I was finally able to snap one side in using a rubberized cloth and then, with a lot of thumb pressure and the protective cloth, I finally got it back together. This amount of work is totally uncalled for in a watch that has no water proof rating.<br />3) I think, if you have to pay for a watch press or pay to have the battery changed because you can't do it yourself, then the price advantage disappears and this will end up being an expensive watch over it's useful life."
3.0,A bit bigger than I had hoped.
3.0,It’s cordory.
3.0,"Have now worn four pairs. I was really pleased until the fourth pair. When I took my shoes off, there were holes in both big toes!  I also noticed that the elastic on the fourth pair seemed a bit tighter and was afraid the elastic would break while taking them off.  Considering the price, I am not surprised about the holes in the toes on the fourth pair.  The fabric is very thin. I look at them as 'fun' socks with probably a short 'life'."
3.0,"I like these tights! They're great for those who want the look of thigh highs without having to worry about them falling down. I think these would look really nice with knee high boots and a skirt or dress. For me, they fit perfectly. For reference, I am 5'3&#34;, 107 lbs. I'm very happy with this product. Thanks, seller!<br />EDIT: They tore today, and all I did was sit and eat dinner. I'm so sad. They're still okay, but a little less so now. With a longer skirt, I could probably hide the tear."
3.0,Shield was not used
3.0,"If it was not small, it would have been great. Needs to also mention that fabric is light, as for a warm weather"
3.0,"Was not happy with the very thin waistband on these underwear.Not enough elastic to hold in place and as a plus size woman,we really need that."
3.0,"I put these slippers on and walked across my hardwood floor. I sounded like a horse clomping around the room.<br />The soles are firm and they don't bend at all. I feel like I'm walking with wooden planks strapped onto my feet.<br />Other than that, they're warm and comfy while I'm sitting down reading the newspaper. Maybe even a little too warm for summer."
3.0,They are good quality but too long. They are bunched on the bottom.
3.0,ya get what ya pay for....but they are cute......
3.0,Color not the same as pictured.
3.0,"Don't look nearly as good as the picture. Any patterns look fake and manufactured, takes the charm out of them"
3.0,Simple but very nice. Can dress up any outfiy for a night out.
3.0,I liked the color and construction.  but it was just to loose and floppy on my feet.  I do have narrow feet.
3.0,It's difficult to see the print because it's black on black and the material is very thin but it does fit well.
3.0,"This fits a bit small. Then it said to machine wash, which I did, which caused it to shrink because it has linen in it.<br /><br />So not a bad shirt, but it fits small, and DO NOT MACHINE WASH or dry."
3.0,You get what you pay for.  They look nice but aren't that breathable and aren't going to move with your body during an intense workout.  Fine for a day of grocery shopping or lounging around the house.  I would buy these again just because they are cute - but not for yoga.
3.0,Not as expected was just a tiny little piece of nylon
3.0,Beautiful but rather cheaply made.  Zipper stitches were wrinkled up. Maker needs to pay more attention to detail. There was fuzz and threads all over in between skirts and threads coming from seams of fabric and the end tail of the zipper shows! Look at pics (I ordered blue and purple and both had the same issues)
3.0,Too small I am acyrue XL  these fitblike a. By 2XL if you are XL
3.0,Doesn't look like picture.  Cheap and ugly
3.0,Would've given 5 stars of the suit had a more supported top part. I loved the style and design and wanted it to fit. Needs a back clasp top to hold the girls in the cups.
3.0,What more can I say? You get what you pay for. I still wore it once and got a ton of complements! But the sleeves are so long...
3.0,"Ear rings are very nice, I thought the ear rings wood be bigger."
3.0,There are good coats but run small and I would’ve liked to keep it if it were offered in a larger size.
3.0,Runs small.  Am returning for a larger size.  Unsure as to quality since it is too small to wear.  Nice looking coat tho!
3.0,keep you dry ..thin.thin.but work when needed.
3.0,"These are lovely leggings, if you are under 5 feet 10 inches. They are buttery soft and warm. They appear to be well made too and the pockets fit the iPhone 13 pro max nicely. However, following the size chart I ordered a size large even though I usually wear a medium. I get Chinese and UK sizing are different from US sizing. However, upon receiving the leggings, the large was too big. I believe the medium would have fit better. These were also at least 2 inches too short for my legs. I would have returned them, but my 5 foot 6 inch daughter fell in love with these. She is 130lbs and the large is slightly big on her as well but the length is great.  She likes them so we are keeping them, but I will continue my search for winter leggings for ladies with long legs."
3.0,"Pretty, and holds my heavy ID badge well, but the end of the pin is almost flat--doesn't come to a point.  Prepare for large holes in your clothing where it's pinned on."
3.0,"Very cute suit - but it ran SO SMALL!  I ordered a 2XL, Im normally a womens size 10.  It didnt fit.  Disappointing because i really love it, and construction was better than expected for the price."
3.0,"I've looked and looked for a velour robe that had a zipper and smocking, but I returned this without wearing it (I had to pick a &#34;fit&#34; before this comment window would open) since I could tell that it wasn't the quality I was looking for."
3.0,"I really like the shirt but in the picture it shows a signature under his left arm, and on my shirt there isn’t one, kind of dissatisfied"
3.0,So this bathing suit for throws me off it is very big in the chest area and very small in the booty area with that being said I am normally between a size 10-12 and I'm glad you're in the butt and smaller in the chest so probably not the bathing suit for me but will fit someone better if they are the reverse.
3.0,A big snug for my taste!
3.0,"The dress fit okay, but the sleeves are puffier than I expected, and it wound up looking a little too much like a “school marm” outfit for my tastes. It was also kind of on the snug side. I got an XL and I usually wear a 16/18."
3.0,"seems like they should be comfortable,  great for the price, but I have returned 2 different pairs b/c they run so small.  still working on fiinding thee right size. order more than one size larger than your normal shoe."
3.0,I got this for an all white event! If you are bigger chested like myself it will be a struggle to button up! It does not look right button due to the buttons looking like they are struggling to stay lol! It comes very long I'm 5'2 I had to take it to get it hemmed! Very see thru as well! First thing my husband noticed when I put it on! Hvnt worn it yet! All of This worried me so I order a back up dress just in case. O and the belt it comes with does not fit for bigger sizes. Had to buy one.
3.0,Good quality. This wallet is really big. The picture doesn't show the zipper down the middle it shows it on the back. That's what I thought I was getting.
3.0,When I first bought them they fit perfectly but after one wash now the zipper won't stay up and completely comes down. They do have fleece in them so they make it a little warm to wear for spring or summer but all in all they are very cute just wish the zipper would stay up
3.0,"Were quite a bit thinner than I expected them to be, but the colors are nice and they were shipped quickly."
3.0,"Nice but I had to fix the chain, it was broken when it arrived and my friend was able to fix it"
3.0,I was some what disappointed that this dress was see through requiring me to buy a slip.  I think the lining should be made with heavier material.  I'm not Jennifer Lopez.
3.0,"Good looking shoes, run’s  very small"
3.0,material not what i expected
3.0,A lot bigger than I thought they would be. Nice assortment though.
3.0,I ordered this band in June and it is already breaking. I had ordered a product previously through this vendor that lasted me over a year. I am very disappointed by the quality change and am wary to order this item again in the future.
3.0,"Great length, great fabric.  Almost had to give them away.  Thankfully I now know a seamstress who can add the ""extra""  needed in the curvy areas for me so that the purchase won't be a complete loss.  I've saved my own day."
3.0,Mixed feelings!
3.0,After one washing the seams are coming out.
3.0,Guitar slips out of holes easily dropped my axe once when it came out smh
3.0,Look like poor qulaity
3.0,Head doesn't fit well
3.0,"The dress is okay, but the fit is a bit awkward.  The tie at the waist didn't help to accentuate my figure, it only made it look frumpy."
3.0,Ordered one size larger because it said it run small and it was long and narrow.
3.0,I did not like this. It was too thick to breath. My job is more physical and I have to breath or I get headaches and very tired quickly. I just thew these away.
3.0,Fits a bit small. Good quality.
3.0,Dress fits nicely but the ruffle at the bottom seems cheap looking.
3.0,ok quality not very resistant
3.0,They was to long waisted and big.
3.0,"There's so many pictures of different necklaces I wasn't sure which one I would get. I've submitted my own so you can see the real thing. It's some kind of plastic that looks like metal and the ribbon is satin-like. It's pretty cute. It is VERY skinny though- not chunky like the pictures (which is what I was hoping for). It's not a bad little necklace, just not what I was hoping for."
3.0,"Looks great but can REALLY start to hurt after an hour or two! At that point, I might as well just get a real septum piercing. Kinda bummed. But the price is good. I guess that's what they're going for -- cheap enough to not bother with returning. I guess it's good for a night out; or something where you can take it off after it starts to hurt."
3.0,"Protects from the sun, but stains easily. Impossible to was stains out"
3.0,The bead where you see the 100 languages of I love you falls out the necklace really easily if your moving a lot
3.0,"This type of super satiny material is not as good as cotton (which I prefer). It's a bit big, but I kept it!"
3.0,"I purchased this dress for a last minute event I was attending.  I had sized up, per reviews, and unfortunately, it was still too tight and unflattering. The dress itself is adorable, but way too form fitting and unforgiving for my liking."
3.0,"My main reason for buying this bracelet is that I have small wrists & therefore have a hard time keeping one on or not catching it on something.. However, I do agree with the reviewers who say the gold is cheap. Not something I will wear on a special occasion."
3.0,"look nice on me, fit nice, looking for a gold one okay for the price"
3.0,"I love the look of this dress, but it fit strange. I first ordered an XL, but it was huge on me. So I returned it, and ordered a large, and it was too tight in the shoulders. Sadly I had to return it as well."
3.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but still super cute! It will make a great spring/summer purse"
3.0,"I bought these for my husband but when I opened them they looked too small like child size sunglasses, I don't know if he will like them"
3.0,"not quite flexible enough,  did not fill my needs but well made"
3.0,After looking at the size chart we ordered a large however it was too big for my son. I have returned the outfit & waiting for reimbursement. Otherwise the costume looked great! Too bad it was too big!
3.0,I wear a size 32 DD so i got a medium/Large and my boobs were not even close to fitting in it. I ended up giving it to my friend who had alot smaller boobs and it fit her prefect. She loved it and I WISH my boobs were smaller so it would have fit.
3.0,"Pretty, have received lots of compliments but adjustable and top heavy so never stays straight."
3.0,I purchased 5 dresses and of the five I purchased all fit well except this one.  It was not true to size  I purchased an XXL and it was a small XL
3.0,These are beautiful earrings but they don’t lay correctly on my ears. Otherwise I do think quality product.
3.0,Well it fit very well when I first got it but it was super wrinkled so I put it in the washing machine and hung it to dry and it shrunk. Now it's skin tight and very see through so I'm not sure how I'll be able to wear it again. The dress is beautiful though
3.0,"These serve their purpose... for a time.  They are thick enough to keep your arms warm, but not so thick that they would be unrealistic for a working person to wear while moving about.  I thought at first that the thumb holes might be nice for transitioning from outside to inside and vice versa, but they have turned out to be quite impractical for use in the medical field.  They don't roll up nicely.  Even if you fold them it's difficult to hide the hole for the thumb (I have short arms, if that matters).  Also, I have worn them about ten times and the elastic at the top of the arm is beginning to stretch out.  I notice them slipping down throughout the day more every time I wear them.  I am guessing I will be able to wear them another ten times max.  I personally feel that the price is too high for an item that I will be able to wear 20-ish times.  To be fair, though, this is my first pair of med sleeves, so I have no basis for comparison for a more expensive brand."
3.0,"I thought the earrings were larger, they appear to be larger on line"
3.0,"The material on the bottom is incredible!! It is so comfortable and there are pockets which is amazing. Its silky and elegant. However, the dress was a bit large and the top is silly. It is loose and much cheaper material."
3.0,The hoodie is well made and nice fabric. However the pants have already come apart in some of the seems and it wasn’t washed! I going to try and sew it back together.
3.0,"A little hard, wears not comfortably."
3.0,"The sweater is soft & stretchy. I’m very busty & typically wear a 1x/2x, but because of reviews I chose the 3x. The fit is more of a standard size xl. I wouldn’t mind because there’s good stretch, but the sweater is too short for my liking. I don’t mind crop tops or anything, however I only like them if I buy them intentionally. I’ll be wearing a jean jacket with this. If it was an inch longer I would have given it 4stars."
3.0,I don't like the material of the sewn in under shorts nor do I like the way it looks so I will likely remove them and wear other shorts when I wear this.<br /><br />It's not incredibly flattering. Bunches around the crotch and tummy. The top part is not flattering to your breast. I am a fan of this style of the ruched stretchy material. I have a dress made completely of it and it's flattering because it's sewn in a way that curves around and accentuates and is flattering..<br /><br />This just missed the mark for me.
3.0,Necklace missing a stone
3.0,Loved the dress. It super comfy. But it is too long. All long dresses are made for tall people
3.0,Loved this but to heavy for my top ear
3.0,"First, it took forever to arrive. It is not ""tummy control"" as described. It's very thin, not compression type fabric. That said, it is a cute cut, flattering style... Just not the ""suck in"" type of fabric I wanted."
3.0,I returned these as they didn’t stretch as much .... but I love this brand
3.0,I m giving three star coz I love the pattern and design of the dress but it’s fabric made me lil disappointed. Fabric is see through and looks cheap
3.0,This is an adorable scarf and just what I wanted. The exception being that the sewing job on the hem wasn't done properly in one corner so it has come undone. I'm not bothering with returning or anything because the initial price was so inexpensive. I'll just fix it myself.
3.0,It's okay but I'd recommend ordering a size up unless you want a thong and lots of cleavage. That wasn't the look I was going for.
3.0,I expected push up padded bra but it’s just tight and scoops your boobs from bottom does the job and I like the seemless part I’m usually a 34b and I found it right so maybe size up. Overall great makes me perky
3.0,Cheap ***
3.0,Dress is very snug and fabric is a lot thinner than I expected.
3.0,"I never received a key to lock it, but its a quality box"
3.0,"The gloves are good cotton gloves but I got these for my husband and they only go down to the wrist, nothing like the picture."
3.0,This dress is not cut the same as the one pictured. The neckline is much higher and the dress is more boxy. Disappointed as I waited a month for this dress.
3.0,Wife wanted these because we thought they were sweat pants but the fabric is more like basketball shorts. She was satisfied with using them as pajamas.
3.0,The zipper was way to big<br />That’s all I did like  about the jacket
3.0,Its very pretty but quality  is not very good and it is about 2 times smaller than posted size
3.0,"They work well, but the quality is visibly shoddy. My socks arrive with bits of elastic sticking out of the lace, as though the elastic was worn out.  Also, the lace is cut unevenly and looks extremely shoddily made, like someone forgot to finish the socks.  They stay on my feet just fine, but you do get what you're paying for -- which is poor quality fabric that stays on your feet."
3.0,Not what expected.  Have seen more adult sized ones and this looks more like a bracelet for little girl.
3.0,"A few balls have come off the stem.  Not sure why, but they are pretty"
3.0,Solid product for the price. Good quality
3.0,"works OK, not the best quality though."
3.0,I liked best the price and the look of the watch.  The least is I have had the watch less than a week and one of the gems around the face has disappeared.
3.0,Shrunk after one wash.  I would recommend buying a size bigger
3.0,shoe doesn't seem to b sized properly.....
3.0,When I took this out of the package it was instantly too big. The net is too weak and I weigh 120lbs and stretched it out the first time I wore it. I ended up cutting it in half and cropping the top portion and making the bottom into a mini skirt with a knot at the base.
3.0,Much higher waist than shown on the model.
3.0,Ordered extra large but the tag inside said 7XL.  It was way big.  The coat wasn’t warm and very nice. I hated that it had to be sent back
3.0,"Ordered a size up like most of the comments suggested and it was too big. Also, the tops cups were pretty far apart. Not as they are pictured. Otherwise it was a well made suit."
3.0,Hard to get the back open to put your fitbit in.
3.0,"Ring runs small. I ordered a 6 (my ring finger) and it fits my pinky. Other than that, I actually really like the ring. Will see how it wears and update then."
3.0,Seems like a kids apron it's so small but the custom came out extremely well was thinking about ordering others but size is just too small
3.0,Super cheaply made but cute design.<br />The metal medallion has turned green after a few months
3.0,"Didn’t fit my key, I have the older design didn’t pay much atttebtion to the details. Still a nice keychain."
3.0,Looks like cheap quality
3.0,"I'm 20 years old 5'2 and weigh about 140.<br />I ordered a medium , fits perfect , but noticed the fabric gets loose after wear until you wash and dry it it gets back to its normal fit. Which got kind if annoying ."
3.0,"I loved that these earrings were light weight and they were the perfect size for me. I love large hoop earrings. The major con is that they do not securely stay in your ear which resulted in my losing one at breakfast one day. If there is someway to fix the security of wearing the earring without falling out all the time, this would be a 5."
3.0,As received they were scuffed on on leather surfaces the stitching on one at the thong that goes between your toes was unraveling would not have taken long to come apart. They just looked used not new and after getting feedback from other purchasers of the same sandals I knew this was not the way should look. Sooo as much as I need a new pair back they went .
3.0,"It fit all right, but was difficult to put on."
3.0,The color is exactly as pictured. Being short it definitely looks different on me than the model in the photo & so it’s longer than I like but it’s a great dress for summer!
3.0,"I love the product, it's great quality but does not fit. I'm a medium normally so knowing where it's coming from I ordere a 2x just to be safe and it still doesnt fit. Hoping a few more weeks at the gym will help!"
3.0,"I read the instructions and measured to get the correct fit. The leggings fit as expected, but the skirt constantly rides up. The skirt is terrible"
3.0,Love the quality. I hate that it's not the same as photos. I wanted a large print houndstooth long cardigan.
3.0,Quality of the shoe is not great. After a few wears the shoe becomes wide and velcro strap stretches.
3.0,"Soft material, inside is brushed for softness but this will mean you have fuzzies all over the floor wherever for awhile. (Took a handful of washes for this to subside) they are indoor pants or for warmer days, and wind or chill will go right through. They are fairly comfy but the waistband is definitely much tighter than size suggests."
3.0,"Once the watch is set it works great. It seems to me that it is harder than it needs to be to get it set, though. Pairing was difficult and you had to reconnect every time you opened the app. It was cool to watch the hands sweep around the dial to sync up."
3.0,"Kinda baggy, doesnt fit snug to leg. Wrong material. I'm 5'1, 117lbs"
3.0,color is kinda ugly. great huge size. probably not really silk.
3.0,I ordered 1 size larger than I usually take and was still too small
3.0,no lo he podido probar aun
3.0,I used this for a dress and it does help boost breats. I did have to fold my padding. Maybe they could have more center clip sizes since I needed this for a deeper v neck dress..plus I may have lost the clip already.
3.0,"While the gloves are AWESOME, and most of my friends say they look better and brighter than other ones, they are poor quality. Upon receiving them, one immediately broke and would turn off when the hand was turned specific ways. Now it wont even turn off, and if the box with the wires coming out is turned a specific angle it will intermittently come on and off. However, the one glove that kept working is pretty cool. I like the black hand with white tips so your hands really disappear in the dark. It is also pretty cool that they have so many settings with bright lights. Awesome product, just hope 100% of it works for y'all."
3.0,Ad says 95% rayon. Tag says 65% cotton 30% polyester 5% spandex.  Colors bright. Decent quality.
3.0,"It fits well, there are about 4 or 5 different types.<br />Is good for the low, low price.<br />Will be careful not to stretch the cord when pulling on and off.to prevent stretching."
3.0,I thought it with under the mask better.
3.0,Product was ok.
3.0,very heavy bag even empty.  I did get a compliment on it for style and color.
3.0,"The top fit a little smaller than expected, but still able to wear in public without showing side boob. However the bottoms will definitely be see through as soon as they get wet. Which is a bummer since I had to go search for similar color bottoms or wear them with shorts. Overall though, I like it."
3.0,super cute but im 5'2&#34; and it wouldn't even reach my shoulders
3.0,"It works, but only lasted me about 9-10 months before it frayed at the slot I was using. Going to try other belts that will hopefully last longer."
3.0,"Not long enough. I mean in the torso.  I ordered a bigger size but they were ONLY WIDER not longer!  They're thin, good for summer, so I don't want to return them. I'm gonna alter them so I don't have a constant wedgie."
3.0,"Bought these to wear one at a time on my right  calf, which suffers from muscle cramp when it gets cold. Perfect"
3.0,"I ordered largest size based on my measurements.  Looked and fit fine except across the shoulders.  May not be the material or sizing, just my body build.  I tend to be more broad-shouldered.  Buy it, try it.  Different body types don't all fit listed measurements."
3.0,I'd like it a lot better without the back clasp to close it. It feels like the button will come off easily. It is also very difficult to take it off.
3.0,Two bangles in a pack<br />The ball on the end comes off while wearing.<br />I wear without beads now and glued ball on
3.0,"When I put it on my first thought was ""this looks like something my Grandma would wear."" But this could just be the way it looks and fits on me.  I do like that the inside isn't scratchy..."
3.0,"Although I liked the quality of the fabric and the way this dress hung on me, I couldn’t get passed how unflattering it was on me. I’m bottom heavy with hips.  My husband said it was ok, but I returned it."
3.0,I need to return or replace it. It's very cute and nice but too big unfortunately.
3.0,"This hat is fine, and fits well, but the Dunder Mifflin logo is not centered properly."
3.0,Great material looks good but way too big.
3.0,"I really want to like these socks but they have a few issues. They were used while I was in 12 degree (Fahrenheit) weather. I wore them with tall muck boots, the battery pack was very bulky and kept rubbing my legs until they felt bruised. I used them on high for one full day and they definitely kept my feet warm,  however,  the next day after being charged all night,  I could not get them to stay on.<br />Thru do serve their purpose when working but the battery box needs to be refined as well as holding a charge."
3.0,"I would probably have given a much better review if it had not taken 6days less than 2 months to receive this item.  I purchased it for my husband, and he asked me numerous times when it was coming.  The bracelet is nice and fits him well. He is not pleased with the link to secure the bracelet.  He does have a small wrist, so please keep that in mind."
3.0,I had to return. I am between M and L. L was too small.
3.0,For a curvy woman I was very uncomfortable in this
3.0,Literally opened these moments ago; love the size and color as I put them on. Closing arms to set them aside and a lens already popped out. It pops back in but is not secure and immediately comes right out.<br />Wonderful if I was a pirate :(
3.0,I love these pants but I must warn they do run small.  The quality is good. The length is good. Just ran small.
3.0,It's ok material but runs small and doesn't look as nice in the advertisement as it does in person but that's ok.<br /><br />Good for the price I guess
3.0,"This is a decent dress, and the fit was nice, but does that picture look YELLOW to you? No? Well, surprise! The dress is yellow."
3.0,good. but I wish it came within a small box instead of within in a tiny plastic cover.
3.0,It's in a thinner material.
3.0,The rhinestones kept falling off before I wore it
3.0,It's fine for price paid for an older child. It broke the first day it was put on. Not recommended for babies.
3.0,"The slit is super high but the dress is a good length on me. I’m super short and it would’ve been fine, but it shows a whole lot of my thigh. The material didn’t wash too well. The color was pretty."
3.0,They're thinner than expected. I doubled then with my Sorrel boots.
3.0,Item is very thin. Transparent on a size 6. Belt design does not line up on waist band seem. Alright for pj bottoms but definitely not appropriate for public given these leggings are more like tights.
3.0,"Very soft, much cozier than the croc brand, however, the strap/band busted within 3 weeks of wear."
3.0,too  small !
3.0,Broke after few minutes...
3.0,Basic sunglasses holder for the visor... had trouble with the mounting...<br />Visor mirror in the way and straps just a little short and therefore tight.
3.0,The material doesn’t look as I expected but it’s cute.
3.0,"Bought this top for my wife with the good reviews. Though the top looks good, it is very itchy and my wife got rashes/marks after wearing it for 15-20 minutes."
3.0,Very thick and  comfortable
3.0,"I did not like the color, was expecting a true brown, this is more on the rust or orangey side"
3.0,"it is not a stretchy fabric and it does not have a zipper, so if you are bigger from the top it may be to hard to put it on.  but is a very nice top if you give it to same one that can wear it, as a present my skinny sister love it"
3.0,basically made of plastic. Not cute at all
3.0,Seemed like a very good product at first. This watchband has disconnected from the watch and sent it dropping to the floor multiple times. I will have to order a different band. Would not recommend.
3.0,"OK, BUT IT WRINKLES SOMEWHAT."
3.0,Loved loved this boots when i got them.... have had for 2 maybe 3 weeks the sole has come loose from the boot on the left shoe... looks like it was jus glued on... glued back on tonight .... hope it works’nnn
3.0,the stitching along the snaps is very itchy. the fabric also bunches between the armpit and boob. I normally wear a 38B and ordered an XL. I do like that it comes with a band expander. the padding is connected to one another and is removable in the middle.
3.0,I don’t think the price lives up to the quality! The breast part is so thin you can’t wear a bra of any color or it’ll show thru. The white bows are also very shiny (which is a huge flaw for me.) The sizing is just a little off especially in the waist. I wear a size US 8 in pants and had to take the waist up a lot. If you want better quality I would suggest investing more. If you are okay with decent quality I would suggest going to aliexpress. Insta: almalwz
3.0,Too narrow. Doesn't cover completely.
3.0,Pretty earrings for a petite woman
3.0,Design is adorable for my Coco loving daughter. But runs very small. I ordered a size a size 6 when she usually wears a size 5 and the sleeves and pants are still too short.
3.0,"The glasses are great, however they are so big, the slide off my face"
3.0,"These lasted long enough to convince my wife to get her ears pierced. Very pretty and great colors, sadly just too painful to wear for the day."
3.0,It’s nice the logo it nice color are exactly like the picture.. size it true to your size... only thing is the sweater is thin..
3.0,Gathers lint after one or two washes and everything sticks to this material.  Still good for an undershirt.
3.0,"I have already reviewed this dress.  It is very pretty, the fabric and print are very nice.  However, it is very poorly made.  There are a lot of frayed fabric ends, especially at the waist.  I normally wear a size XL, but I purchased this dress in a XXL because of past experience with this style.  I also purchased it because of the price, as I am a seamstress and can make the necessary adjustments."
3.0,Estan lindos pero la calidad no es buena
3.0,The fabric itself is a little more see through than expected.
3.0,"I love the lacy, flowy design of this dress. However, it is too big for me in the chest area so I had to return it. For reference I am a 32A."
3.0,"I love it! Though there's a bit of loose thread and it seems very cheap and the top of the hat is kinda awkwardly high. But, I still rock it and wear it with my blunt bangs :)"
3.0,"The dress was well made and fit like a glove. The fabric was absolutely see through, even with nude underwater it left nothing to imagination."
3.0,"These fit well overall and are cute, but they could be designed a little better. The fabric is a silky polyester that is not very breathable. The pocket for the dust filter is large and just below your nostrils... because of this, and the fabric type, when you breath in the fabric goes right up your nose and is a bit suffocating. Breathing through your mouth is not much better. I'm going to try cutting the filter pocket out to see if that improves things."
3.0,"smaller than expected, look nice though... kind of an industrial feel to them."
3.0,"Cute set, I just wish it was in a more forgiving material, like cotton, or something a bit breathable. That's my only negative for this set. Fit well."
3.0,I am usually a 6 but I ordered an 8....way too small.  Had to return.
3.0,"Remember the stretch cord on Halloween masks?  These are exactly the same, and the crimped-on ends come off easily.  Also, not much stretch, so if you purchase, get wider than you need."
3.0,"Loved the fabric but elastic in waist is very wide, tight and uncomfortable."
3.0,It's just okay; kinda heavy; not exactly what I had in mind.
3.0,"I like the fit and feel, however, the graphics are super cheap and start peeling off after the first wash. So now I have this shirt I like, that I don't want to wear because I can't risk getting it dirty."
3.0,Sometimes I buy a store brand item and am pleasantly surprised that it’s every bit as good as a comparable name brand item. Such is not the case here. The shirt doesn’t stay put (it climbs) and doesn’t seem to wick very well. The seams irritate me after running several miles and having them rub against my skin. Wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t buy again. Going to be looking for a better option.
3.0,Shirt was large and didn't hang right due to the type of material it was made from. Very cheap looking.
3.0,Wasn't right for my body type but gave it to a friend who it worked out well for :)
3.0,"The fit was a bit loose, but can be worn as is,"
3.0,It wasn't quite what I was expecting.
3.0,"Nice fabric, very soft and cozy feeling. The hat is very generous in size, the gloves fit well, but the scarf is very small in proportion. The hat is almost too roomy but can be adjusted by folding up the cuff or pinning. If one has long hair, there is plenty of room for a bun or ponytail. I do like that the hat covers the ears well. Have not yet worn in cold weather so not sure how warm this is."
3.0,I think these earrings are a nice size and pretty but the picture shows silver and they came in a tarnished looking metal. They are still nice but do turn my ears dark so I gave them 3 stars
3.0,Arrived late and lobster clasp was broken
3.0,"These panties are nicely made, but are cut for women with narrow hips and small waistlines. They seem more like a size 7. They do not cover the buttocks well. Buy a size up."
3.0,Good quality overall but backing pin attachments are very sloppy and quite loose. Coloration is very nice.
3.0,"I wanted this shirt to be so nice and fun.  It fit well in the top and sleeves, but the back ""tail"" is so awkward and NOT at all like the photo.  The photo online makes the tail look long and flowy.  The tail on the shirt I ordered was more just like a long piece of fabric that looked like it needed to be tucked in.  I'm disappointed and sending it back."
3.0,Good wallet size. Leather is soft. Color perfect. Phone fits great.<br />Downside: needs bigger coin pocket.. ZIPPER doesn't close right. Comes off track a lot and getting worse.
3.0,This pants is skin tight on me and can see right thru. There is nothing left to the imagination. Wish i got 3 sizes to big bcuz the material is so comfy.
3.0,"It has a snooze on it which kinda defeats the purpose and for some reason, it stopped working after a couple days."
3.0,"I got a large, I'm usually a medium. When I work out I like to wear a baggier clothing. It fits like a small/medium."
3.0,"These shoes are so cute and I was slightly disappointed when i tried them on. they are slightly too small (the back of my heel is slightly off the back, not super noticeable so i will still wear them but just a little sad about them not fitting better."
3.0,Doesn't fit TTS
3.0,"This product is great for the price you pay. I have large bust and a smaller waist so the suit did not contour to my figure. The butt of the suit was only slightly larger than the front, so if you wanting full coverage this suit is not for you. I ordered a medium. I am 5'7&#34; 115 size 30FF bra. I ordered a medium because of my bra size. Which is probably why the waist was larger."
3.0,"First let me start by saying that the fit and design of this shirt is beautiful. The material is a little thin, but nothing terrible. However, I ordered a burgundy color and I received a bright red shirt? The shirt is cute on, but not what I ordered."
3.0,Fell apart within a year
3.0,I like the shirt and it does wick perspiration away but cat claws snag it too easily. Didn't have it on for more than two hours before it got damaged by my cat just walking on it. Her claws were not that long.
3.0,"Pretty, but very stiff.  Doesn't drape on the wrist the way I would like.  However I have a petite wrist which might be part of the issue."
3.0,Too warm for Florida weather.
3.0,I liked it a lot. Was a little disappointed in the quality of the leather. I do like the claw clasp a lot
3.0,Super cute on but doesn’t hold up well after washing a couple times
3.0,"Cost me $20.00 to have them fit me at a Shoe Repair,"
3.0,THESE LEGGINGS ARE 100% SEE THROUGH. I wear a pair of simple black leggings underneath them to counteract how thin and see through they are. It's a fun design...but not meant to be worn in public without secondary legging back up.
3.0,"I liked the length, but the product was too flimsy."
3.0,So so pretty and looks exactly as advertised but I was bulging out the sides of the cup despite ordering the correct size 36 D
3.0,"cute but the ears on the costume are always lying down, it's frustrating I never got them to stay up"
3.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and ordered a large.  The torso is too short.  I can wear it, but its uncomfortable, and isn't as flattering as it would be if the torso were a little bit longer.  I wear a 32 F, and the cups are still very large.  I had to tuck in the extra fabric on the sides.  It's okay for an internet purchase and the price point, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,"Pinches my finger, but it's cute"
3.0,"These sandals would be ok, except I ordered a size 13 and got a size 11.  I need to return them.  They are very lightweight and would be good for the pool, but make sure you order at least one or two sizes up."
3.0,"Really cute dress and I can't say anything was specifically wrong with it just didn't like the fit as well as another dress I ordered for the same event. Over all cute, just not quite perfect for me."
3.0,"This is a very cute piece but is extremely big. It says it's for 0-3 months but is actually made to fit a 1-2 year old. I needed this item for the upcoming winter, not for the future. I'm keeping it because it seems to be well made (although I haven't washed it yet) and is good looking piece, but now I still have to spend more money to find one that actually fits 0-3 months."
3.0,"It looks good if you have bigger boobs. If you don't, than this product isn't for you"
3.0,Kinda really tight fit
3.0,I love the texture.
3.0,"This is an odd, but cool necklace.  The silver charms jingle like small bells whenever you move quickly, so know that ahead of time.  The cord is what's so odd.  It's a cord like one might use for upholstery, with a knot in the back that allows for tightening and loosening the necklace so it can be slipped over your head.  It leaves a fair amount of clunky cording hanging down your upper back, but it also allows the wearer to choose how high they want to where the necklace on their chest."
3.0,"The cut of the shirt is super flattering BUT it’s made of some weird synthetic material that I don’t really like. It’s not breathable at all so on hot, humid days here in the south,  it’s a hard no."
3.0,I was kind of disappointed<br />It said a variety of colors..<br />Received 1 grey 3 black
3.0,"Nice material, but size isn’t even close"
3.0,"These were great looking goggles, although I had to return them. They were too large for my face. I don't have a small head/face...just normal size for a mid-40's lady. The goggles went from my hairline to nearly the tip of my nose, which pinched off my nostrils making it difficult to breathe. Sounds funny, but it's true. That was the only problem I had with them and would have kept them otherwise"
3.0,Not as multifaceted as the picture shows. Doesn't really catch the light well. It is pretty on its own though.
3.0,"Background color is patchy and inconsistent. It's a cheaper finishing job, but still a decent buckle. Function is fine. Appearance looks better online."
3.0,It's not bad but it's not great.  Quality seems to be on the cheaper side.  Sometimes it's hard to get the screw to line up so I'll spend a few minutes trying to put them on.  They look super cute but I wouldn't want to leave them on for a long time or keep them on in the shower.
3.0,The shorts fit perfectly. But the top however is huuuge around the chest. I ordered a size Small. I am 34A chest and the top I received feels like a size Large. It had about 2+ inches of excess fabric around the chest. I am not going to deal with the inconvenience of returning it bc I am happy with the shorts. I will just use my own tops and donate this ginormous tank it came with. Would absolutely give it 5 stars if the top fit. Too bad!
3.0,"This garment came in an envelope shrink wrapped with multiple creases embedded in the yarn.  I am slowly getting the creases out with a steamer.  It is shown as green, and another customer showed it as yellow.  The sweater I received is  khaki.  I bought it as a gift and since the recipient wants this sweater and style, I am working with it.  It also has a minor hole along the back collar where it is stitched to the shoulder, and I will whip stitch it.  It is roomy overall and the sleeves are drop shoulder so they are not tight.  If you are looking for a quality item, this is not it.  However, it is a cute style, loose, and comfy."
3.0,"I bought the black and the red one, they are both super cute and flattering.<br /><br />The stitch is messy, threads hanging everywhere, I cut them off as I see them.<br />Washes okay but the stitching threads will come out more.<br /><br />It’s definitely flattering. The material is light, flowy and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The delicate stitching is camouflaged, but just know it won’t be an item you’ll have for a long time."
3.0,I got this skeleton glove for my halloween costume and the thumb part broke on my 2nd time wearing them. They do leave some marks on your skin after wearing them and don't have very good quality. overall they looked pretty sick.
3.0,Made well. Has a lot of stretch. Bigger on the top than I expected. Soft material. Love the pockets.
3.0,"I am about 5 ft 5 in, 120 lbs, and a 34 D (for reference).  This is a bit too small on me.  The middle triangle goes down to my belly button, so my navel ring gets tangled in the middle strap.  The top is also too small on my chest, but I like that there are cups inserted.  Other than those problems, everything else is pretty similar to the picture. Besides the &#34;beading.&#34;  There are no beads.  There are just printed fabric meant to look like beads.  I know that is to be expected when ordering from China, but it is still disappointing.  I mean.  They don't have to lie, you know?  It is still super cute, and I think I will be bringing it to spring break, I will just have to choose a new belly button ring to wear.<br /><br />Disclaimer, I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review as a hobby.  This does not affect my opinion in any way."
3.0,Love the color and material but the fit was unflattering. I'm a fuller sized woman. Plus if you will. But the XXL fit looser than expected. It seemed as though the calf of the leggings didn't hug my calves or even the the thigh portion also didn't hug me as I wanted. They were just all around looser fitting for an even more fuller woman. If that makes sense. I'll probably give them away. Not sure yet.
3.0,These shorts are alright. I would definitely size up one if you have bigger thighs. They just weren’t my style when I tried them on.
3.0,I should have sized up for a more true of the shoulder fit. The material is nice but did not fit as expected on the shoulders
3.0,You can feel the wires - a little tighter than I had hoped
3.0,"The sleeves are about an one and a half inches too big in diameter,and 4 inches too long at the bottom,otherwise,it fits me great!!!!"
3.0,"I think this dress will look incredibly cute on some body shapes, but it's not really for me. I went up a size, because I prefer my clothing to be looser and I felt like this one might be a snugger fit than I prefer. While it is loose enough, this type of material is on the clingy side, showing off more than I'd like, even in a larger size. Too, the top gaps open more than I care for, though the design of it makes it super easy to pin it. I also don't care for the waist. After trying on a few waisted dresses, I've realized that I don't care for them. The extra seams are irritating to me, so I now know to avoid them. The material isn't my favorite, either. While I wouldn't call it rough, it's not as soft as it looks and it's the kind of material that snags easily. Overall, it is cute, but it just doesn't work for me for several reasons."
3.0,"The scarf is rather thin, and the filter holder started to unthread after a weeks use. It would frequently fold over and push the carbon filter out."
3.0,"I bought 3 double packs of these. For my children ages 10, 8, and 3. They are really tight getting over the heads of the 10 and 8 year old. On my 3 year old they easily go over his head but don't stay up on his face they fall down. First product I have purchased like this so not sure if that's how it is supposed to be. The fabric seems like it may tear easily if the kids mess with it too much. I will update if that happens"
3.0,"Mine was too big but I couldn't figure that out because I couldn't install it. The pins for the thing blend in with the case and there's not hint at their location. And you can't remove links which is unfortunate so I sent it back. However it seems like a good idea, just poorly executed."
3.0,"I like this unitard, but its use in the flesh color is limited because it is see-through.  Not just panty lines; I can see the details of my tattoo through the body suit.  Perhaps darker colors would work better?  Also, I wear a dress size of 8-10 and ordered a size Large, and it is very tight.  Smashes my breasts flat, and pulls down on my shoulders-- the large size is not tall enough for a 5'7"" woman.  I had to cut the edges of the scoop top to get a couple of inches on the height to avoid it cutting into the tops of my shoulders.  It is comfortable, though, and will work for me (after cutting to get those inches) under another costume piece.  I would say, if you have a costume that just barely covers you, you could use this bodysuit in this color, with skin-colored underwear, and be confident as far as nudity is concerned!  By itself, though, it is too see-through."
3.0,"Volcom men's wife beater style ""A"" tank tops came in a variety 4 pack and we're extremely soft although they were very thin in all four colors white gray black and navy and too short for both myself and my husband in a large and that was the biggest size Amazon offered at the time. I would say they run too small at least in length, no problem with the width!!"
3.0,Fit nice but too short. Couldn't raise my arm without showing too much. Would have to wear leggings underneath but that's not what I wanted it for so I returned it.
3.0,"The beads looked old and faded, I wouldn't recommend it"
3.0,"I ordered a larger size based on the reviews and the bathing suit fit ok, however I don't think it was well made. The band around the top wasn't quite tight enough, I'd fear it falling down if I jumped in the water (I'm a 34C and I ordered a large). Also, the band in the front didn't touch my skin, it came out as far as the cups did and I could put my hand up through the space.  The underwire is encased in white material and that shows at the top. Overall I was not impressed with this swimsuit, however I reported this to the seller and they were great about working with me on it.  They wanted to know exactly what was wrong with it. So, while the suit didn't work for me, I was impressed with the sellers concern about their product and my satisfaction. I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review."
3.0,"Not very high quality tie clips. One of the clips had a small unstained strip of bare wood. These are not varnished or anything. I only wear them occasionally, so it's not a big deal for me, but don't set your expectations very high."
3.0,They felt good for about 5 hours but then started causing one of my toes to bend back.
3.0,"Really pretty at first, then tarnishes quickly and loses shine."
3.0,These are good quality but not long enough for my toes (I wear a size 10 shoe).  Those with smaller feet would like them.
3.0,"Feel nice however, it took forever to steam the wrinkles out. Then I literally kept cleaning my brush since so much fabric was caking up into it."
3.0,"I really love the fit and color of these pants, however if you have the slightest bit of cellulite it will show. I workout outside and these pants show sweat marks. Wanted to love them for workouts but now they are to wear around the house. I ordered a medium they are a tad loose in the waist but could not have gone to a smaller size. FYI I'm 5'7, 150 and wear a size 8 pant"
3.0,"Purchased this hat for Halloween. The only problem is that the hat is way too big, it looks silly."
3.0,"The fabric is a little softer than what is expected of an Oxford Shirt, but stitching and other proportions matched the stated size perfectly."
3.0,"locket is very cute, but the chain is very flimsy and already broke..."
3.0,"It's big in the chest, but the bottom fits nicely through your hips."
3.0,Love this band but the color wares off really fast.
3.0,"Looks like a bra more than a blouse top, it’s thick material made tho"
3.0,Blouse is beautiful but ran small especially the arms
3.0,"Bi-focal part is very close to center (maybe not wide enough), I feel like I'm crossing my eyes to look through it. Nose bridge is to wide for my narrow nose."
3.0,3 star for trendy design.<br />just be aware that It gets oxidized which left colorization on my ears.
3.0,"While the top fit, the bottom did not. Way too large in waist.  Wish it had a draw string bottom."
3.0,"It is great, but my baby’s feet are too fat😂 if it came a little higher it would be good but he can’t wear them... more for a keepsake any way"
3.0,"The dress is lovely, the color is just as the one in the picture, the fabric is nice too... but it is way too big. I know it's suppose to be a flowy dress... but for me it was way too big, and I ordered an XS. I'm 144cm tall, and I weight 42kg."
3.0,Worked great! Just right for a size for smaller women's head to size a fitted large hat down to a manageable size.
3.0,Fit true to size.But color is off.Ordered purple camo.They are a brown and pale pink
3.0,"I bought this for my husband but it is tight material. It does cover his face but doesn't fit properly, and it slides down instead of staying in place. It does cover his face but it was a disappointment."
3.0,Fabric is a bit thin
3.0,"Bought this to wear as a cute skirt, it came down over my knees and looked like something my grandma would wear"
3.0,I bought this for my niece and I was a little disappointed with the wond and wing quality. They weren’t as durable as I’d like.
3.0,The sequins keep falling off
3.0,Like wearing a sheet.
3.0,"Very pleased with this band for the first two months I had it, BUT now, my FitBit falls off my wrist multiple times a day due to the connection failing.  Would recommend looking at other options."
3.0,"Cute gloves, but they look cheap.  I have them in real leather, fit much better, and better natural color."
3.0,Order a size up from your normal
3.0,"Everything sticks to this material, although it's very comfortable. Fits snug."
3.0,Color is great! Sizes are quite small l
3.0,"Love these, thought they would be a little gaudy but they're not at all, get compliments all the time"
3.0,This is a great dress but it is very thin. There's no way it can be worn with a slip and bra. My daughter is 5'8&#34; and it is the perfect length for her even while wearing heels.
3.0,"This does not come with the hoodie as advertised. It has a regular collar. Also, color is much darker than pictures. Seems like nice quality though, so that's a plus."
3.0,Bar to short
3.0,Little small but it works
3.0,Runs small order a size bigger
3.0,"This prouduct was very vintage looking. I like that but it was too vintage the buttons were all rusted causing some stains. (I used vinegar to remove the rust) Has a strong smell , it looks like the picture just very old ,"
3.0,Body of suit is too short for me.
3.0,Pretty sure it says it's unisex but it is big on my head and the brim is really long. More for a man. Nice that it is waterproof and folds up nearly but rubs the top of my ears when I wear it.
3.0,"After a long and exhaustive search for compression packing cubes, I settled on this product.  The cubes only fit comfortably in a 24 inch bag, not so well in an actual carry-on bag which is 22 inches. The compression is so minimal it barely saves any room. If I had to do this all over again, I would buy the plastic vacuum bags since they flatten out far more than these bags do. I have not traveled with them yet so I don’t know of their durability. They seem to be well-made, which earns them three stars."
3.0,Pads for boobs are enormous :/
3.0,"It's very nice, and it fits comfortably. The little dangle just fell off quickly after purchase, but it still looks fine without it. A very nice, comfortable product."
3.0,These earrings are alright i guess. The pearls dangle just below the ear lobe though for some weird reason and you have to be very careful with them because it seems like the whole piece will come out easily.
3.0,I didn’t think the size of it would be a big deal but no one is reading it and the print is off center
3.0,"No idea the buckle was bent and also wrong color,  box said , black but the belt was brown u"
3.0,"I liked that the mask was realistic looking enough to use as a movie or video prop head (over Styrofoam head)<br />But when wearing it, my eyes started to sting...badly... and I had a hard time breathing even with the nose holes in the mask.<br />So I cut a new mouth hole in mask. I also gave her a hair cut or trim. The hair was too long & unmanageable!"
3.0,"I bought it hoping for a cute dress...what I got was I fitted swim coverup or even sexy long shirt for only around the house. The material is nice...however, I'm sure if I dont hand wash it,  it will shrink. I purchased the xl size. I am normally a 10-12. If it came possibly one size larger, it would be ideally my size."
3.0,Silver does not match polished stainless steel apple watch. It is brushed. Will return
3.0,It’s more of a blue teal than green
3.0,Sizing runs small and a little tight.  If you have wider feet or like less snug shoes you should order at least one full size larger.  Shoe is water proof but if you get the area around the heal wet your feet do get damp.  Also below the insole when the shoe is wet inside needs to be of better material.  When I removed the insole to dry the shoe out the material was disintegrating and shredding like thin cardboard.
3.0,Lights are junk. 3 little batteries that fall out of hat. Wasted time beer drinking time looking for batteries.<br />The Hat was fine for this holiday party
3.0,Got up a size. I'm 5'8 and it's too short for my taste. Doesn't stretch much
3.0,"Very cute, but was a bit smalll for the men in the family… they kept breaking when put on."
3.0,Double layer of fleece is nice and soft. However there’s a really stiff rectangular tag with tough corners right near the bottom that will inevitably run against my toddlers’ neck. Bad design but I’m keeping it bc I can’t find anything else that’s comparable.
3.0,"This was a darling skirt but it was just slightly too big for me. Also, it was REALLY gathered (more than the photo) so it didn’t lay very well. The color was perfect for summer and fall. It wasn’t a bright yellow. More of a mustard."
3.0,Cute on however there are slits going up the side. I'm 5-4 and they hit very high. I'm keeping but maybe as a bathing suit cover up.
3.0,"This jumpsuit was cute but very small. I ordered a 10 which is my normal size but I was busting out of the top. If they had a 12 I’d order that, but they don’t so I’ll have to return."
3.0,"Very cute, warm and comfortable bootie. Unfortunately I had to return because they run extremely small. My normal size is a 6.5/7 and I bought one 8.5 and one 7.5 pair based on other reviews. Both sizes fit exactly the same. Toes touched the end of shoe and there is no way you can get a sock on with the size. Order at least 2 sizes up and hope you get a pair that fit :)"
3.0,"It is comfortable, my 7 year old wore it for Halloween. It did not meet his clothes so not as long as I was expecting, also he wound up taking it off because he could not see for trick or treating"
3.0,"The skirt fits fine, however the shiny material was not expected and didn't look the same in person as it did in the pictures."
3.0,"It took a really long time to arrive, but it’s just as described. Cute and affordable"
3.0,"Strap broke. I made the mistake of wearing this for the first time on vacation carrying a heavy bag on my shoulder and my strap broke.  Configured it into a halter and it worked just fine.  I still have it, and it's very cute!  Would be SUPER cute on someone smaller than me, I got the XL 5'5 190 lbs."
3.0,"color of pearls are good, cheap sting used, spacing is poor... look is good.  It works, not a bad buy."
3.0,"Decent sandal, got for a shower shoe for the gym.  They are very narrow which makes them uncomfortably tight."
3.0,"Did not use.  Ordered for surgery, but 1st was way too large,  second still too large, and delivered too late due to snowstorm.  Will be returning."
3.0,"Decent quality, cute style, but weirdly they gave me a wicked headache after only an hour both times I've worn them and not due to tightness around the ears or nose or anything like that- they feel perfectly comfortable in that respect."
3.0,Super cute but wrinkles very easily
3.0,"I love this, but it looks dirty. The pink isn't vibrant and doesn't mesh with the surrounding fabric. It isn't dirty, it just looks like a dusty/mucky pink color.  If I picked a color different than pink, this would probably be a 5 star item."
3.0,"I was going to leave a 5 star review - LOVED them, comfy, perfect for working out, good fit. But when I took one of them out of the wash to wear, it had ripped around the neckline. I always wash all my workout gear together on delicate and then dry on low!<br />The other two are just fine. Might order more but don’t want them to rip again... ugh!"
3.0,Looks very low quality
3.0,It is see through but ok as a cover over a swim suit Sandra Robinson
3.0,The pattern and detail are poor.
3.0,"Very thin, but decent quality. It’s definitely see through but it’s fine for warmer weather."
3.0,You have to have a small wrist to wear this.
3.0,The pant doesn't fit well as the top. The back part of the  pant has elastic but the front part is plain. It feels odd. The Top had spots/stains. The shawl had a peculiar smell but it was beautiful. The only reason it made the kurta wearable
3.0,"The two are very cute. As much as I wanted to like it, it didn't have enough support to make me feel comfortable(I wear a c cup). It would be nice if this had adjustable straps. I would recommend this to b cups and under."
3.0,Meh. The lace was too large and looked very cheap.
3.0,"I ordered this dress for a wedding, but it was waayyyy too small.  I ordered one size up and thought I'd be safe after reading reviews.  However, it was at least 2-3 sizes smaller than expected.  If it fit, I would have worn it, but luckily I was able to find something lovely the next day!  Hated to return it because it was a great buy for the price."
3.0,"Picture is just not representative of how short waisted this is.  I am only 5’6 with a small chest and yet the elastics waist still sits 5” above my waist.  If you are super short waisted or you like the babydoll look that make sure everyone’s stomach look bigger, I guess it would be fine, but definitely not for me."
3.0,Item received with only one shoe working normally
3.0,i was expecting a higher quality with it being $30 when i received it i felt that the clothe was too thin.<br />honestly i would pay $20 for it but not $30. rating 3 stars because of that fact.
3.0,"Bright color but Size are not right , it seems the size are from different country"
3.0,I love the look of the watch but the white leather band looked beat up in a matter of a few weeks and I didn’t wear it every day by any means.
3.0,"Fit as expected but the bow is a weird satin material that you cannot get to look like the bow in the picture.  The dress is very long for a &#34;short&#34; dress... it is a knee-length dress on me, and I'm 5'11.  The colors were a little too dark for my liking so I ended up returning this item. I am normally a medium and ordered a medium which fit perfectly."
3.0,"This shirt I ordered in an adult size XL. It's a cool Tshirt if you like Fortnite, which my son does. This shirt size in an adult XL is more like a boys size Large. I ending up giving it to my younger son instead."
3.0,"Purchased as a gift. Very thin material, photos better than actual shirt."
3.0,"when I received the package, one of the gems was missing from the earring. it would have been fine given there are so many colors....but it was the &#34;diamond&#34; (clear) and that's basically why i bought the item."
3.0,"I've given the item 3 stars, because the top is beautiful. The bottoms are not wearable. I ordered up a size (large), and the bottoms don't come even close to fitting. Since I love the top so much, I'll order a different bikini bottom to wear with it. I'm 5'2&#34; and 128 lbs. wear a size 6 & 34 C. The bottom sizing, in my opinion, would be an extra small."
3.0,"Got them on special and still overpaid.  These glasses just feel cheap, like something you would get at the dollar store.  Also, the lenses are so big it makes you look goofy.  They certainly don't look like men's glasses.  I'm pretty disappointed, but it would probably cost me more to send them back so I guess I'll just throw them in a drawer or put them in the car as a backup pair.  I wouldn't be seen in public wearing them.<br /><br />Update: This company's customer service has been great.  They sent another style of sunglasses to replace this one.  Those didn't really work for me either, but I've upgraded the rating just based on their responsiveness."
3.0,"The quality doesn't seem to be too bad, but these sizes run very small. I thought by ordering up that I would be ok, but you should probably order up 2 sizes to be safe"
3.0,It wasnt sturdy as I had thought
3.0,I like the blouse but the arms are a bit tight
3.0,"I like the different color, they all the same shape. What I don’t like is the ear stud to whole the earring in doesn’t not stay. I lost every last one after I put it on . It falls off . Other than that I do like them."
3.0,Was not as pictured.
3.0,5'2&#34; 140 lbs i ordered medium and it was quite snug so probably should have ordered large. It looks nice on but i found it very difficult to get on and off when wet because it was so tight.
3.0,"Looked great from the front but was very tight on my (large) nose to the point where I actually had a bruise on my nose by the end of the night. In the back, there is a large slit which is necessary to put it on but very visible. I stapled it closed while I was in costume, which fixed the problem (because of the Tim Burton Catwoman's make-shift aesthetic), but of course I couldn't take it off until the end of the night, which exacerbated the nose issue. Despite its problems, the mask was worth it because I looked fierce."
3.0,"I would avoid this item if you're a larger person or just have a bigger head in general; as the ""fits most sizes"" and ""stretchable"" is undependable."
3.0,Very widely cut in the front that shows all your  cleavage and some stomach but over all very nice!
3.0,The opening is very small. I had 1/2” ribbon I wanted to thread through them. I had to cut it at an angle to get it in. Works though.
3.0,"Ring is flimsy, I have to watch it to keep the charm from falling off."
3.0,I think it might be in an Asian size. I got the size that should have been roomy for me but it was too tight.
3.0,This isn't linen but a man made material. Nice size tho.
3.0,"Very Very tight fitting, almost hard to move in.  Order a size or two larger than normal pant size."
3.0,Fits like a garbage bag somewhat. I feel runs big.. I wear a size 8 and bought a medium. It's cute just doesn't fit as I expected.
3.0,THE MATERIAL OR FABRIC IS STRETCHING I HAVE OTHERS FORM THE SAME MANUFACTURE THE FABRIC COMPLETED DIFERENTE
3.0,"The dress is accurate to the pictures the company put out with an exception for the strap along the back of the dresses. That seems to be missing on the dress I got. I think the floral print and the dress's material is great, but it wasn't great enough to distract me from how ill-fitting it is on me. The length of the dress was a little short, and the top half of the dress just didn't look right on me. The waist on my dress way too big and just a tad too high from my waist, and the halter looks awkward on me (but that's somewhat my fault because I don't have big boobs). I'm giving this dress another shot by taking it to a seamstress next week."
3.0,It started to turn colors pretty quickly
3.0,Nice dress but somehow large on my burst.
3.0,"Pretty cheap looking, but its ok for what I paid!"
3.0,Bigger than I expected but fun.
3.0,The only reason this outfit did not get 5 stars was that the bow on the skirt did not come tied. It was just 2 long strips of ribbon hanging down and was not attached well.
3.0,Nice fabric and construction but runs small
3.0,"I have a green color dress and its beautiful and comfortable as this one. But, unfortunately, this one came with tiny wholes in the back of the dress and length is uneven. Left side is a little bit longer than the right. Sadly, unexpected!"
3.0,Print is cute but it’s more of a men’s cut.
3.0,"This is definitely a beautiful watch, and it's eye-catching, too. The iridescent element is pleasant to look at, although I agree with some of the other comments that it is kind of hard to read from certain angles. There's no reason why we couldn't have our cake and eat it, too, as far as having some iridescent coating but not so dense that you can't read the face of the watch. But what do I know?<br /><br />Apart from that, the other thing that is confusing to me is how you are supposed to manage the settings. The instruction manual is completely opaque and doesn't really make much sense. I did figure out how to change the time zone, but it thinks I'm on daylight savings and I'm not. Weird. So I had to move to a different time zone, aka Halifax instead of New York. Even though I'm in Detroit. Anyway, seems like these things could have been avoided with maybe an additional button or a better instruction manual.<br /><br />I will update as needed."
3.0,my daughter did not enjoy the draw string waist she said that to make it stay up it had to be to tight on her tummy
3.0,"Shirt is not as dark as in photo. Shoulder drop off holes are really large. I got an xl, and it fit everywhere but there."
3.0,"Bought this for my die hard Pat fan of a husband. lol. Within the first day, it was not gripping his cash and cards. It was too loose and his cards kept falling out. He is not new to the money clip and has been using them for years. So all I can say is we put this up on the shelf as a novelty display instead of functionality. Other than that, It looks nice and seems to be made well. Sadly disappointed he can't use it through out the day."
3.0,"Many reviewers reported that these run large, so I broke my eternal rule to always-buy-XL-hats, ordered a large, and it rode, nerdy and high, on my head. Looks good on my petite wife, though."
3.0,Very nice graphics and overall execution. But cheap clips killed it within 4 weeks.
3.0,"I ordered this necklace after looking around specifically for a pink heart to match my photography business logo. This looked like it would fit the bill perfectly. It arrived quickly, was packaged nicely and is much like it's shown in the pictures: nice, thick, black 'chain,' and bright, pink heart. However, the photos don't show, and I didn't read anywhere, that the back of the heart is flat and black. Feels like plastic instead of glass. I would not order this again for the purpose that I did, but I think it's a pretty low end piece."
3.0,easy to put in. but too big in my opinion
3.0,"I loved the ring, but it was too big for the finger I wanted it for, and too small for the others.  It was also heavy. not sure if I would have worn it, if it did fit."
3.0,No me vino la mascara en el traje y en la descripción lo dice
3.0,"I love the color, but after 2 weeks, the rhinestones start coming off."
3.0,"Great long hoodie style. Ordered the brown, unfortunately the color was not as deep as I would have liked. A darker brown would have been much nicer in my opinion. I bought the black instead. Love it!"
3.0,"Cute color, but the fabric felt cheap. Way too small."
3.0,The price was affordable but the paint job was very bad. I don't know if I will even wear it.
3.0,really loved the shoe. great colour and the fit unfortunately for some reason found them difficult to walk in and had to return. Broke my heart to return
3.0,I love the colors and the fabric but the top is cheap elastic that folds over and is not comfortable.
3.0,"the shirt is super cute, but it's not nearly as long as it is shown on the model"
3.0,"For the price the band was cute and made the watch a bit more feminine, but it began to tarnish within 2 months or so, had to stop using it."
3.0,Turned out not my style. Looked different on the picture
3.0,The post is far too thick for standard ear piercings. Very disappointing.
3.0,FIts for a tall slim. I'm short and stocky. Otherwise nice material and cut.
3.0,Can't be sure that the bracelet is 925 silver as advertised.
3.0,"Happy with the design and quality of the print, but the sweater came with a hole on the sleeve at the wrist and got a second hole in the neck after one wash."
3.0,I found this to be very clingy & a bit smaller I thought for the size chart
3.0,Nice necklace for an in expensive piece but isnt quite my favorite.
3.0,I really love these jeans. My only complaint if the material that covers the zipper fly is sewn in a manner that it will not fully cover the zipper. So the zipper is always exposed and that looks a bit unseemly in my opinion.  So I either always wear with a belt that will cover or with the top untucked or closed in a manner to cover the exposed zipper.<br />This may just be a one off pair that I received and not the norm.
3.0,"Size and appearance is what I desired (ear piercing for a guy, didn't want too big/flashy). Very hard to open and close, even having a friend didn't help. Also, I think the metal is what makes my ear keep getting infected, but that's just me. Considering forking out the money and switching back to real gold."
3.0,"The stripes on one side rubbed off after I wore these a few times. Good sunglasses, but not $50 worth."
3.0,Got them quickly but don't separate the girls like I hoped it would.
3.0,Too loose. Doesn't stay in one place
3.0,"My Granddaughter weighs less than 100 lbs and is very tiny.  I was worried about this being to big when I ordered. The material was very nice and the coat was sharp looking but it was WAY TO SMALL for her. Luckily, I could send it back. I think it came from China because it had a strange name inside the coat. I think Amazon should have an American and Chinese size chart. It would have fit my 8 year old Granddaughter."
3.0,This Charmyi dress is super cute and practical. It is navy blue with large white polka dots. It is short-sleeved with a belt. The dress stops above the knee and has a hidden zipper. The fabric is soft and comfortable. It is a blend of polyester and spandex – very lightweight. It fits true to size. You can dress it up with a jacket or bolero sweater.
3.0,"Closing this bracelet is not the easiest thing in the world.  Swarovski needs to improve snap, so it will be quick to lock in."
3.0,"It was really cute and fit good, except the bra part. If you are a C cup or bigger, yoi may have trouble. Im a D cup, my breast spilled out and theres not much support. I wante it to fit but I had to return it"
3.0,"I love this mask, because hey, snoogans! But the mask is not very big or thick and probably won’t stop very much coronavirus."
3.0,"I love this top. It looks like a heavier weight in the picture but it’s definitely not. Feels like rayon, very lightweight. It’s really cute on but it runs small. Could definitely size up at least 1 maybe 2 sizes"
3.0,"I love the top, but it did not fit as expected, I ordered an xl and it fit like a medium, I'm going to reorder the next size up, hopefully the new size will fit."
3.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress. I had planned to wear it to my fiances boss's house for thanksgiving. I read the reviews before placing my order and decided to go a size up since that is what the reviews said. I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 110 lbs. If you are small I would highly suggest ordering a small! I ordered the medium and was swimming in it. I am going to give it to a friend because it is really cute. The dress is not the same as the picture, but was still cute. I like how the material is a bit on the warmer side too! It looks cute with a scarf."
3.0,Buen size y control
3.0,"This was a gift for a friend and she was pleased.<br />However, it looked like there were 10 different onesies but it was two each of the same print. Why would you want two of the same outfits?"
3.0,Too small for my daughter so I had to return it unfortunately.
3.0,"I like the variety,  but they break easily. :("
3.0,They are great for sure but run small!
3.0,"Came scratched, didn't return because it was inexpensive but, yeah... You get what you pay for."
3.0,Not really red more like orange looking and pattern is blurry looking more than pic.
3.0,For the price I can't complain.
3.0,They do what they're supposed to do.  There's not much else to say about the.  But they do work as desribed.
3.0,I first ordered the charcoal pair and I LOVE them. They are SOOO soft and comfortable I could wear them 24/7. They are the perfect balance between stretch and compression. But these black are not the same :( they seem more plasticy? if that makes sense. Too elastic and not as comfortable. Disappointed because I wanted these in every color but they are not all the same :(
3.0,Wear a strapless bra if you are top heavy
3.0,"You know when you try to save money and go for cheaper but when you receive the item you realize why they are cheaper?  These masks fall into that category.  The thickness is okay, it comes with extra filters for protection.  The print design which was the main reason I bought these masks failed big time.  I have purchased a similar mask with the Day of the Dead face print somewhere else and the design aligned with my face perfectly.  The prints in these are made for ginormous faces or giant heads -- they look strange when worn.  The effect is stupid because my face is not that big and then the print has a huge mouth that goes from ear to ear.  Disappointing!"
3.0,"It's a bit small and very light material, making it a little seethrough."
3.0,It was ok for what I needed it for. It fit great. Just the material was super thin
3.0,The color is vibrant
3.0,They are to small stone is pretty but small
3.0,"This dress is nice, but... It's very see threw on top. Kinda see threw on the bottom. I'm 5.5 I have an hour Glass body, hips 48&#34;. This dress is flowy so you can't see the curves. I like that. This dress is right in the middle of my ankles. Would have liked it a little longer. I'll still wear it, I will just have to wear clothes under it."
3.0,Cute with my costume. Took a long time to recieve
3.0,"Pretty cute!  Doesn't go over the bum like a tunic as the picture shows.  That said, it's a nice TShirt."
3.0,"The band itself is good and seems to be good quality but the quick release pins, and the bar that attaches to the watch is too thin and short to fit my watch. They barely come past the band. It's not secure enough for me to risk it coming unattached and losing my smartwatch.<br /><br />I may get a little ballsy and try to pull the pin from another watch band and replace it but not right now."
3.0,"Ordered a XL.  I'm 5'3"", 160 lbs and busty.  Sorry I had to return it as the chest area fit like a small and I am in proportion.  The rest of the measurements fit great, couldn't button up higher than my tummy.  Loved the dress."
3.0,Great looking but runs way to small
3.0,"I ordered this for my daughter at her choosing and is reviewed by her notes. I thought the price was fair but arrival was about two weeks, still faster than quoted. The Pros: Comfortable, forming tapered cut, unique design. The Cons: Hood is smaller than desired, Gathered lint easily, Zipper is poor quality and broke after two weeks, there are no pockets and the pattern is &quot;shimmery and scratchy&quot; For any questions, feel free to write."
3.0,"I had a heck of a time getting these capris over my thighs and hips - the waistband does not stretch enough.  It fits fine once on, but takes a bit of maneuvering to get there.  The fabric is NOT buttery soft as advertised.  It is comfortable enough and would perform alright for a workout, but it is not as soft as similar brands.  I also do not recommend these as lounge capris - they are an exercise fabric designed for that purpose only."
3.0,Kind of cheap quality but cute for one time use.
3.0,Lasted longer than the gray one I bought previously but just as crappy. Thick and brittle rubber that is not durable.
3.0,"I loved these earrings! Unfortunately, the post broke off of the 7mm which I wear on a regular basis. The 8mm are a little big, but I put them in anyway. One of them has a loose stone so I will need to purchase more. Beautiful while they lasted."
3.0,"The fabric is a little cheap feeling. The fit is a little odd for my body shape, as well. It is wearable, but not something I ever reach for because the fabric feels so cheap."
3.0,"Too small, I had to return it. They gave my money."
3.0,"Nicely made, but size was almost too small!"
3.0,&#34;Off Duty Mermaid&#34; shirt is cute but do not dry it. It runs small and would definitely shrink in a dryer.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:1478c9249df6e475a01bac5435b4978]] They have a good amount of stretch. They are tight enough that they don't slip down my arm. They are not soft but they aren't scratchy. The stitching is fine until you get to the thumb hole which has a lot of loose threads on all 4 pairs. They dont overly smell bad like most clothing that is shipped over from another country but they have a slight vinegar smell when you are close to them. Overall a 3 out of 10. They only cost 12 dollars for 4 pair. I could have made these myself for the same price by going to a dollar store. Not a total waste of money.
3.0,I purchased these and decorated them.
3.0,Not the best but they are ok.
3.0,I thought it would be a little bigger and sturdier than it is.
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713WVJJ7/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10
3.0,Nice as a temporary fix.
3.0,I loved them but unfortunately they were bend when they arrived.
3.0,"They’re very pretty, but not as small as I had hoped for. I wanted something small for the 2nd or 3rd ear lobe peircings, these are too big for that."
3.0,If your tall it fits short on the torso and a bit snug on the chest.  Looks cute but quality isn't the best.
3.0,like that their 80% cotton with NO spandex in it thats a plus but washed them before i wore them and they shrunk more than i thought and are now a bit tight have to stretch them out some but do go above the calf so their ok
3.0,"This product is a good buy for the price point. It is made of a cheaper material, but that is not to say it is bad. The material is akin to a plastic table cloth, but with more elastisity. Though i feel you could rip the seems if not careful. However, as a costume piece it is perfect for those getting in to larp or medeival costuming. I can not forsee a scenario that you could rip it while wearing it, but do use care while taking it on or off. I bought a 2xl, as i am a slightly bigger man, and it fits great. Just like any t-shirt i could buy."
3.0,This is a huge watch and very heavy but it's what my daughter wanted!  Make sure you measure the dimensions yourself so you know what to expect.  Personally I think it's too big for a petite woman but that's the style.<br />Came on time for Christmas.  Packaging sparse.
3.0,"UPDATE….Changing my original review from a 5 star to 3 stars. I purchased these in 2021 and they fell apart in June 2022. I live in a state where we have about 4.5 months of summer weather to enjoy and wear flip flops. This year, June of 2022, as I was wearing them, they simply fell apart, which is disappointing because they were mostly only wore on a grassy surface. I will recommend them to someone who will only wear them occasionally but I won’t recommend them to someone who would wear them more than that…….COMFORT TO THE MAX - GO UP A SIZE!"
3.0,Fits right in the waist and butt area and loose at the ankles.
3.0,"These were cute when I got them, but you can tell they are cheaply made. Some of the metal clasps have come off of the &#34;leather&#34; strap, but you can easily clasp it back on, it's just a hassle. Thankfully none of them have came undone while I was wearing them, but I could see that happening eventually. The long necklace is also just one long &#34;leather&#34; strap. You could wear it in different ways, but it doesn't clip on or anything. These are cute, but pretty fragile, just keep that in mind."
3.0,after a short while uncomfortable.<br />I ended up throwing them out.
3.0,Son still loved it but the size was not as expected
3.0,Loved this until the metal part of the clasp broke off twice !!!! Fixed it once not very durable.
3.0,They're a whole lot bigger in real life than they look online and feel sort of cheap.
3.0,I like this skirt so it's a good thing I can sew. I knew this was not supposed to be a quality brand skirt but was still disappointed that they did not make the effort to at least enclose the elastic around the waist. But I will do that myself instead of mailing it back because I really like the way it looks on me.
3.0,"Nice, comfortable shirt. Sadly, the colors of the logo didn't match the one I got."
3.0,Not the most comfortable fabric - bought it for the color combination to match something else
3.0,This suit looks amazing.<br />Buyer beware the size of each component is different! The under short is tiny even in the largest size. The large and extra large vest are identical. Gloves and mask are also tiny no matter what size you purchase and wont fit an adult.
3.0,Quick ship but I bought a XL in this cause it said size up and well it’s more like size up twice
3.0,"Much larger than described!! Order down 1 or 2 sizes from the chart size. Not soft material AT ALL, very stretchy & color match was perfect. Have a verrrrry curvy figure, True hour glass, 29 waist & 40 hips, fit around my thighs but loose everywhere else!!! For women who are a little more older in age, 50+ in my opinion."
3.0,"Image was not as visible on the earring as in the picture. Kind of hard to tell what they are when wearing, but my daughter still liked them"
3.0,"I ordered a small to wear on a recent vacation. I am 5 ft and 110 lbs. I received a lot of complements on this dress, but the top has bad design. The strap hooks kept slipping out of the loops, so I had to safety pin the straps to the dress for reinforcement otherwise the straps would not stay hooked. As other reviewers said, the lace front is a bit awkward and the fabric covers too much. The skirt part is beautiful and is better quality than the top. I will wear this dress again but it is extra work having to safety pin the straps to stay hooked."
3.0,"The back-end is more tight than I would of liked and I feel like the thickness of the suit is not great and am afraid that when I get it wet, you could see through."
3.0,"Fit great, looked great but started to have piles after the first time wearing it."
3.0,"The product is good, considering the low price.  However, would have liked to have a size selection other than &#34;one size fits all.&#34;"
3.0,"This dress is adorable, but there are two things to consider. This does run a bit on the larger size. So if your child is between sizes, you may need to size down. The petticoat shows way more in person vs the product image displayed. I will most likely be going to the fabric store to buy additional fabric to mask the petticoat more.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope this review was helpful!"
3.0,Good shirt. Looked like what was ordered but sizing was way off.
3.0,These fit very snug and can be hard to get on if you order your normal size. The elastic in the fabric also has a tendency to stick out.
3.0,Cute outfit but not the best quality.
3.0,"This dress is truly beautiful, fits nice and the pockets are the best BUT the seam on the top are pulled. I tried it on and noticed it right away. After I inspected it a bit better both of the dresses, I purchased the tan one as well, are both poorly sewn together. Disappointed in the quality."
3.0,"I would only wear these to work out, which was not really what I wanted.  Also, they fit weird--they fit me, but when you walk the butt area starts sagging, which is not attractive."
3.0,Thinner than expected but still cute.
3.0,The insert fit great in my tri-fold wallet and no problem holding cards and other info.  It is made from thin material and makes your wallet thinner.  I recommend it.  My only problem was the price.  It marked with a Suggest Retail Price of $1.50 and I paid more than three times that amout with Free Shipping.
3.0,Fits great just not hypoallergenic like it claims to be.
3.0,"It took about a week and a half to arrive, which is good considering the fact that most things that aren't prime take around a month to arrive. On concerning this was that this product was packaged as a Wish product. I have ordered from wish before, and I know for certain this is from Wish. I'm not including the full packaging in photos for obvious reasons. I guess I didn't notice it in the picture, but the mask has one side with a normal loop and another side that looks like it was sewn by a kindergartner. I really do like how the design is printed, but being a Korean person, this doesn't fit my tiny face. This is understandable considering that Oriental people are generally smaller than Caucasian people, but it doesn't make much sense to me because these masks are popular in places like Japan, not Canada."
3.0,"The sweater is absolutely beautiful. It’s so soft feels like cashmere. For reference I’m 5’0 and 130lbs, ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I usually wear a medium so I finally found something online that the size is true.<br /><br />Depending on your height will determine how much of your belly will show. I put on some high waisted jeans and my bellybutton and a little bit of my lower back showed.<br /><br />Update: when I finally wore it, I noticed there is a hole on the right side shoulder area. :("
3.0,Some what small but it worked for my daughters costume as a cat
3.0,A fun necklace to wear! Thanks Amazon.
3.0,I actually wear this dress around the house every day!  I wore it throughout pregnancy and now while breastfeeding.  Straps are easy to just pull down.  It is a light and comfy dress and fits nicely over my now enlarged DD boobs.  Two issues:  I bought two of these and both had small holes (one on the strap and one on side seam) almost like a moth ate through.  Curious that it was on both (ordered separately at separate times).  Also color fades a bit after a few washes.  But I didn’t return as I live in it around the house.
3.0,A little on the brassy looking side.
3.0,"Rises up  the thighs when exercising but that’s ok definitely wash first , the dye is awful"
3.0,"The band looked cheap compared to how much it cost, and the sapphire was smaller than I expected and almost black. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"These glasses look cool and they seem well-made.  Unfortunately they don't fit me well.  The nose pieces aren't adjustable and they're spaced pretty wide, which makes the glasses sit so low that the bottoms of the lens holders rest on my face.  If your nose is wide enough for the nose pieces to rest on it, they should fit fine.  In my case I'd have to pack a bunch of pads onto the nose pieces to make the glasses sit up off my face."
3.0,"Very rough material.  No adjustment in the neck, which wouldn't be a problem but it seems to hang too low.  (I'm 6' 1&#34; tall)."
3.0,Can’t use touchscreen
3.0,"Not entirely sold on the peacock or fox rings. They don't hold the string in place well. The third is okay, but I'll be looking for something else to use."
3.0,"These are okay. Good for the price, but I won't buy again."
3.0,I wasn't as pleased with them as I expected.  Maybe it is just my eye prescription that effects them differently.  They do brighten things but at the same time there is something about the way things look that I don't feel real comfortable with. Please try them for yourself because the might work real well for you.
3.0,"The watch itself is so beautiful. My husband loved it but, the pin to help you take out links was weak. I bent one trying to take one link out. It took so long to get it down to size. Not sure if the pins in the links are too tight or the pin to get the other pins out are too weak."
3.0,"They do not change to dark sunglasses like the photo, my reason for purchasing.  The change is very faint, but I do love the way they look."
3.0,"They’re ok quality, but the glasses were a size too small for me, plus the lenses are actually smaller than suggested in the photos. Don’t suggest to people with wide faces and small eyes, like me, lmao I look japanese now help."
3.0,"It seems very small for a one size fits all, but it is made from nice material and is a good design"
3.0,"5 stars for shirt, old school fit so size down if you want it tighter - I’m 6 feet and 180, large is perfect. Customer service is reason for 3 stars, original order never came and now trying to get them to not double bill me. These shirts though, are sweet."
3.0,"I don't like that material.  I bought the exact size, but I do not fit the material is way too poor, and the bust tends to slip down the sides even buy my correct size. I think it's a risk buying lingerie online. Really I can not recommend this product. No it was worth buying this product. But maybe I found other women left him well."
3.0,"I really enjoyed the pants. The color was exact and the fabric felt great on my skin. They do run small and stitching seemed weak in a few spots. I paired the pants with a black shirt and jacket. Overall, happy with the look but unhappy with the small fit."
3.0,Kind of small. I wanted big oversized glasses but these made me look like a pinhead.
3.0,They are pretty. I thought they would be stamped that they are sterling silver. Maybe the rose gold is not.
3.0,"Nice idea, so so execution. Quality of material was lacking and slots are tight."
3.0,"If you are getting these to wear, do not purchase. They are SUPER cheap quality. Definitely something to only use as decor. Which is what I needed them for, so it worked out. Lol"
3.0,"Not how I imagined it. It looks cheap, it's glittery and the print is painted onto the cheap fabric. Considering the price, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"The remote was missing!  No remote, is that right?"
3.0,deberían ser más un poco mas largos.<br /><br />pero por lo demás está bueno
3.0,Ordered the 5xl for my husband and its snug.
3.0,"Although it is pretty, it is much heavier, and bulkier than I anticipated. Wish they showed this on someone in a picture before I bought it...you may want the longer chain to go with this"
3.0,"somewhat disappointing. they are much smaller then on the picture. they are not hanging off an earlobe but just hugging it. but they still look cute on me and i am an adult.<br />if you are looking for small hugging earrings with a stone they are for you. the stone color is good, little lighter than on the picture though"
3.0,Bigger than I expected so I couldn’t use it<br />But it’s a good product
3.0,"These pants are very thin ! And clingy & I noticed they are a bit see through too but they are comfy for sure, I use them as lounge pants so they're good for that but definitely not thick enough to keep you warm! Item as described and got them fairly quickly I would recommend them for lounge at home pants but not more than that. Couldn't give them 5 stars because they're just not thick enough to wear out!"
3.0,The socks are comfortable and seem to be of decent quality. I like the pattern of the bottom 2/3 but the top feather pattern is odd.
3.0,"Material is cheaper than I thought.  It's not flexible.  Only the elastic at both ends keeps it tight.  Other than that, the material is weak."
3.0,It ran very big. I’m normally a large but could have used a medium or maybe even a small. Great for a nightshirt though. Very soft but too thin for a tee shirt. But very comfy for a nightshirt. Decided to keep to sleep in.
3.0,I loved the strap but it didn’t fit my series 6 Apple Watch and had to return it. It’s built quality was good and finish is great
3.0,Beautiful shirt. I normally wear an L but ordered XL and it's still too small
3.0,They look like they are made well but they didn't fit. I'm gonna try a bigger size. The place selling gave me the ones I had and refunded me. Thank you!
3.0,"This top fits a little larger than I was hoping, and the color is more like a dingy white than a light grey. It also shows spots quickly - not sure what I spilled, but after one wear it has stains on it. It was inexpensive, so I'm not feeling too bad about it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,"The blazer is nice, can be fitting for work or a night out. The pants are a little tight on me in the waist/thigh areas."
3.0,The elastic is very wide and tight.
3.0,Mask are very thick and not breathable. Sides do not fit due to adjustable strings being attached at each end instead of going all the way through the loop.
3.0,cheap quality - but cool for a costume or something<br />really big - which i love!
3.0,I was expecting the shorts to be longer than they are.Capri shorts:I don't regret the purchase and will buy another pair.
3.0,cute design but not enough stretch
3.0,I bought this for my daughter to use for school as she doesn't like to carry a regular backpack. The fabric is thick and seems to be of good quality however one side came not attached but was an easy fix to tie it on like the other side.  After using this bag only  5 times one of the loops came completely unattached making it unusable. Im going to try to fix this issue as my daughter needs it for school. Maybe I received a defective bag seeing as it came the way it did.
3.0,I received these today and was so excited. They were packaged very well being sealed in a small bag within a small box as well as the box sealed in plastic. This made me happy as sterling silver can bend easily. Upon opening them and taking them out for inspection. I noticed several things.<br />1. They were much smaller ( I have very small hands) than I thought and less detailed and sharp looking as the pictures showed. Very thin!<br />2. One was slightly bend which is odd since it was wrapped so well.<br />3. The keyhole in one almost looks like it was broken and then fixed as it’s very thin there. This makes me wonder if they will break easily.<br />I’ve added a few pictures so I hope they are helpful.<br />They are cute but I’m not sure how much wear I will be able to get out of them and I hope they do not break. I’ve looked a long time for some cute key earrings that were rather simple so I hope these work. Not quite a 4 for me.
3.0,"When I looked at the product on line, the scarf was filmy and light. The scarf I received is a different fabric, more like soft wool, nice, but not what I had ordered. I am disappointed. Can't see me ordering from them again."
3.0,Good choice of colors.  Guess they are ok.  Let’s see how they react when washed.
3.0,This runs a bit small in the torso and the artwork is a pressed plastic that feels very strange. Concerned to wash it because it seems like the art will definitely get ruined. It’s cute but for the price and time it took to ship I was a little disappointed
3.0,Love them but the gold hoop was very very difficult to snap
3.0,"Colors are good and it looks nice on wrist. Not too bulky. But, less than a month after using it, it already came apart. It looks like it’s just glued together instead of stitched at all so I’m sure this happens to most."
3.0,Excellent quality. Fits a little smaller than I expected. This is a very comfortable shirt to wear.
3.0,This is a cute dress but the material is really thin and the waist is at an awkward place.
3.0,The picture is accurate but I thought it was a mistake and I was getting a red top.  Returned it.
3.0,It doesn't fit quiet good. A little small for an L/XL size.
3.0,It's cute but since the skirt is heavy it pulls down the top... It's not the best material but it's good for play time and her 30 min ballet class... my mother in law had to adjust the top so she could wear it since it kept pulling down ..
3.0,"These shoes are really cute.  They look Comfortable.  I ordered and 8-1/2 D, my usual size.  These were too narrow and short.  They are going back, which makes me sad."
3.0,"This was smaller than expected and gapped in the front. This may not be any fault of the blouse itself, as the sizes may just run small for my body type.  I felt like a clown in the colors, beings that I am a large.  May look great on the model or someone of a smaller size, but definitely didn't look good on me."
3.0,"It is a nice, simple keychain with the MAZDA emblem. It actually has a good weight for a small item.<br />However I do not like the locking mechanism.<br />it has opened more than once without my knowledge while in my knapsack.<br /><br />I kinda like it but I can't recommend it in good faith."
3.0,Ordered khaki. This is not khaki it is the color of baby poop
3.0,"They are ok, but am a bit disappointed. .  These are a gift and mine didn't come with a jewelry box to present as others had mentioned in their reviews. They came in a small satin looking bag with Chinese symbols on it.  I can't present it this way.  I suppose I will have to find a jewelry box for presentation.  Overall the necklace is nice, but I was expecting more than a bag."
3.0,Works depends on your eye sight how good or bad
3.0,"Fits as expected as to waist size, however this skirt is crazy long ---my friends who are close to the six foot mark would love it. My 5'-6&#34; self however is going to have to have some serious hemming done -which sucks because jersey material is hard /expensive to hem."
3.0,This is cute...but the eyes were broken off.  No way to repair them.  Cute but disappointed!  I probably will just see a couple buttons on it.
3.0,Nice material but it’s NOT padded like I thought it was. A little disappointed in that
3.0,Small and cute better for a child than a grown-up
3.0,It's cute my only problem is the pockets stick out giving you a weird shape .. It's very short and I'm 5'7 and the dress stops right passed my butt checks.. sink wear this at home ... I've had it for a months and a few washes and it us holding up well..
3.0,Cute but balled up quickly.
3.0,I bought this with the yellow band in Small and it fit fine and color was similar to my computer screen.  I wear a US size 6 Petite.  This same dress with the red band in Small was way too tight.  Also the red color was not as vibrant as it looked on my computer screen.
3.0,"The material is a perfect medium weight, the fit, buttons on well, length are all fine.  Color true olive green.  Unfortunately on the white piping there are pink/red marks on neckline placket..marking either where buttons are supposed to be sewn on or slits cut for the holes.  I washed shirt & marks didn't come out.  Not that they are as big as flags but this is new shirt and quality control should be better."
3.0,"So I got this because I love sailor moon, the purse is cute but the inside the seems are already falling apart and I haven't even used it, but nothing like a quick fix that I can do, but still using It for the wedding I have to go to"
3.0,"I usually don't purchase clothes online and this is why. I did read the reviews in advance, but most were optimistic for me. I agree with another review about the pockets. I'm going to try and cut them off and see if that helps at all.  Seems like they are in the wrong spot. The size is also off. If I were ordering again I would order a size larger than necessary."
3.0,"Quite comfortable but don't last.  I bought these for security work in January.  They did well for a couple of weeks but by mid February the stitching started to come apart.  It's now nearing the end of March and the palms are pretty much toasted and most of the stitching is gone.  I'm going to continue to use them until they're 100% ruined though.<br /><br />The knuckle padding is very nice, but the seams on the inside are very thick and if you have your fists balled, or holding something tight, they start to dig in.  This is my 2nd of 3 pairs of 5.11 gloves.  So far they all kind of suck.  Walmart brands last longer :("
3.0,Great sunglasses. The only thing that I don’t like is that the color scratches off easily. Maybe get the black so the color doesn’t show through.
3.0,Way too big. The lenses go below my nose. I'm not trying to cover my whole face. They're pretty though so I'll leave a few stars for style.
3.0,"The print is vibrant and beautiful. The issue is that the material isn’t your standard warm sweater, this is like a thin sheer fabric, similar to wind breakers or running suits. Not at all what I was expecting. With that, I’m not happy."
3.0,"They fit a bit loose in my ears. I did buy the correct size, however they slide out during wear. The black silicone ones fit well though."
3.0,Didn't like that it wears off in spots that gets rubbed on but matches great. Went over white souls
3.0,I have ordered these several times with a good fit. However;  I am fairly small and with their conversion chart wear a large. I honestly don't think this suit would fit a tiny 10yo.  The top was completely flat. The suit was beautiful and good quality. So sorry it didn't fit.
3.0,the quality is not great. the fit is OK but the fabric is pretty scratchy even after several washings.
3.0,Read the reviews and decided to size up. A lot. I’m usually a medium but decided to get an XL and it’s still pretty small. If you want an oversized fit I don’t suggest this jacket. The XL isn’t tight by any means but definitely not oversized.
3.0,Dress is not lined and is very thin. More like a T-shirt fabric.
3.0,Very cute. I love them but unfortunately after wearing for 2 hours the left side button is loose and turning around. They are glued and it came loose. 😞
3.0,"These ran a little small. Originally I was looking for underwear that would address my chafing issue but these did not. Nice color, comfortable fabric."
3.0,I like these glasses but the blue pair has a couple of scratches and seems a bit distorted compared to the tortoise pair.
3.0,Cute but thin<br />I was looking for thicker ones
3.0,Broke after only a few months
3.0,Unfortunately they were smaller than I anticipated and I couldn't get them on easily.  They were returned with no difficulty.
3.0,Be careful the sizing is way too small for american builds<br />had to return my large jacket it was way too small<br />not worth the aggravation..<br />I was planning to use the jacket when I go to my Veteran Functions<br />US AIR FORCE VETERAN ..but forget it
3.0,The photo they show make it fit like a regular sock and I thought it would  go higher on my Calf. I do recommend it for a sock to wear around the house
3.0,"The color is accurate in the picture, however mine is shorter and wider than it appears so it doesn't look as nice. I normally end up wearing it under a cardigan to hide the extra width, but then you can't see the cool back! It is comfortable material though."
3.0,"I am DD and the armpits holes were large. Otherwise the small was a good choice for  me fit around my chest and torso.<br />I was a hot mess in this dress. This is designed for tall women only. No short women. I looked like a skinny blueberry melting in the hot sun. If you are short and curvy, you will look like a very plump blueberry."
3.0,"Cute bracelet and my daughter liked it, but the dolphins are not as prominent as I'd like them to be."
3.0,"I got this dress and is cute..... so I order 2 more.. the second order was horrible. The green was different, The inside fabric was a low quality (I can see my underwear) see through. And shorter even that I order the same size..."
3.0,Definitely more of a junior fit and smaller fit than I expected.
3.0,Great price - super cute - but broke in first week
3.0,"I love the color of this shirt.  Having read the other reviews, I knew the shirts were ran small.  I ordered this shirt in rust and brown.  The brown in large fits like a typical medium.  However, the rust in the same size large fits more like an extra large.  While I understand the sizing runs small, consistency in sizing (one size large fits the same as a size large in another color) would make me far more likely to purchase again.  That said, it's difficult to find button-downs in desirable solid colors."
3.0,These leggings are ok but the fabric is too spandex-like for me. Not my favorite.
3.0,"Nice shirt I had to give it away, way to small.  And orderd right size !"
3.0,"These sleepers look really cute, but don’t have enough arch support and generally are not perfectly comfortable. They run a bit large, and seem to stretch with time.<br />The first couple of weeks some fluff inside the sleepers kept peeling during wear, but then it all peeled off.<br />They work fine as quiet night sleepers, but I can’t comfortably wear them around the house all day."
3.0,"I’ve had a few of these Double Pump shirts both in short and long sleeves. The chest fits all right for a large, maybe a touch on the tight side, but it’s acceptable. But the sleeves... I’m not a huge guy, but the biceps are snug. In the long sleeve the forearm is skin tight.<br /><br />I would buy more shirt sleeve, but I feel there are better brands. (Izod, Goodfellas)<br /><br />A wrinkle resistant fabric would be an great addition, These wrinkle badly."
3.0,"I liked the color of blue shown in the picture. I thought it looked like a cornflower blue, but it is a brighter royal blue. I also thought it would flare out a little more on the bottom. It is a little loose on top and a little tighter around the behind than I like."
3.0,"Fits ok , not as comfortable as I expected. But not horrible."
3.0,"Nice dress. It's a little short, but not too short."
3.0,"The pockets make the shirt look awkward and saggy. The sleeves are also quite “wide”, but that may be because I ordered too big. I am 115 lbs and ordered a medium. The quality of the fabric seems fine to me."
3.0,Its okay. Looks a little cheap. I will wear it until it turns dull.
3.0,Cute patterns but the crotch part is so skinny that my 3 year old constantly has to pick underwear out of her butt
3.0,These leggings are super soft which I love and the bump area fits great but they don’t pass the squat test so they’ll be at an at home option for me
3.0,Love the show for the price but they tend to be much more narrow than the usual shoes offered with the skechers brand. I use them for work and after a day of being on my feet they are extremely tight.
3.0,"I really like the bracelet, but it started turning copper within a couple of weeks and then broke last week.  Am going to use the beads on new chain and replace the clasp."
3.0,The photo looks more like it toner ink instead of a burned/engraved look as it’s pictured. Not bad for the price but just not what I had imagined.
3.0,"Longer than expected and a size bigger than stated. If you plan on wearing it at your waist, please go for a size smaller! Very cute otherwise."
3.0,"Ok dress, would have looked better if it were lower cut. Its not low cut like in the photo. It comes up too high for cleavage and if you pull it down in the neckline area it distorts the pattern. Overall the fit wasnt like the pic. I'm 5 foot 5, 155 pounds, 38D. My boobs are big enough that it should have been good but it's going back."
3.0,"I agree with the other reviewers - this watch is awesome in what it offers for the money.<br />I just want to add my thoughts on what disappointed me.<br />I had a previous version of this watch (I don't remember how many) decades ago. This was before cell phones, and I found the DATABANK feature so handy for holding phone numbers, pass codes, and other small items of info. I loved that watch to death (literally).<br />I was looking for a new watch. I wanted illumination and a count down timer, as well as an alarm.<br />This newer version focuses a lot on its DATBANK feature and world time. World time is useful to me in watching world markets. The DATBANK feature could be useful in remembering a few key numbers. The memory is non-volatile, which is nice - on my old watch, replacing the battery meant re-inputting all of my data.<br />I like having a portable count-down timer for all sorts of things - my memory is bad and I need to remember that I have something cooking, water running, ebay items ending, etc.<br />The count down timer works basically as you might expect, with the following exception: you start the timer, and after a while instead of staying on the timer screen it returns to the main time display while the timer is running. I so don't like this. I want the timer screen to remain until I switch away from it. This is not customizable. OK, well if I have to live with that, I can. But my original watch (decades ago) had a very audible alarm. As I recall it came out of a speaker between the two big rectangular buttons. This watch does not have a loud alarm. It's really not possible to hear it over the din of an average set of ambient background noises in my house. In that regard it's fairly useless. My theory is that this comes from the watch being water-resistant and having no exposed speaker. This alarm would not wake me up - I can't even hear it over the furnace fan or my aquarium pump.<br />So, it's still a good watch - a bit shiny and flashy, but the leather band is very nice. It's feature rich, but doesn't manage to most perfectly execute the features that I most wanted.<br />In the end, not a lot of money to pay for disappointment - and a drink of water won't kill it."
3.0,I really love these glasses but to wide for my face. So they slip very easily. Otherwise they are cute and very stylish.
3.0,"Love the large charm. The chain came broken but I didn't have time to request a new one, so I put it on a leather cord and it worked really well. The charm itself is large and I love it!"
3.0,I actually like this dress accept I wish there was more coverage in the busy area
3.0,Very cool concept and its fun to wear on my wrist...a lot of people think its very cool but it doesnt stay on your head...its missing the curve that goes around your ear.
3.0,"The material is very lightweight.  Because of how thin the fabric is, I would not trust it for sun protection."
3.0,"I returned the Kissourbaby Women's High Waist Book Cut Capri Leggings Thin Yoga Pants with 2 Pockets because the material is so stretchy that it clung to my body, nothing like the image on Amazon. They were tight to my thighs and at the knees they suddenly flared out something like a mermaid."
3.0,"I ordered 3 of this, nice hat, but one had a white thread sewn on the top shadow, please replaced it"
3.0,They are cute and look like the picture but the iron on is thick so the shirts lay weird.
3.0,"Overall it’s a decent product but it’s made with very heavy fabric and double layered, very hot in the summer sun."
3.0,The arm length after a wash went from my wrists to mid arm after a single wash. Shame because I love the feel and look of the shirt.
3.0,"It's a good bag with lots of room and pockets. The only thing is it's not very structured, with all the things I carry it makes the bag very slouchy looking"
3.0,"Evidently I ordered a Plus Size, not sure how I did that but guess I did. Went back to page and that description is still not obvious to me... whatever. Too difficult to guess if proper size would have been a style for my body type. The length of the shirt seemed quite long for me (I am short). But the feel of the material was fine as was the color and floral design."
3.0,"Dress material is a little thin, but for the price I expected to that. I wore a scarf to cover up the chest area. I am not that busty so I was a bit surprised that it was a little tight. I ordered the XL and I usually order a large. I am a little taller than 5’8 and 180lbs. I usually wear a 12-14 American size."
3.0,You get what you pay for. The fabric is very rough and I felt like I was wearing a burlap sack. I am still wearing it if I have nothing else to wear and if no one else is home...it works.
3.0,It's really cute but It's huge!
3.0,"The cat itself is cute but the chain looks old, tarnished and used!  But then again, what do you want for 99 cents, right?"
3.0,"The photo is deceiving - it is basically a highly filtered version of the actual keychain.  The actual product is not smooth nor light silver in color - it is much more roughly made, a darker alloy material, and the layer of aurora boreal is on the crystals are scratched.  Overall, it looks like a cheap keychain.  Not returning so I don’t ruin my return levels over a keychain."
3.0,"It is not a normal warm sweatshirt material. It is like a  thinner, nylon type blend. Wish I would have noticed that before ordering. My fault. Otherwise a nice hoodie. Ordered size 10-12 for 8 year olds, but wanted it roomy and to allow room for shrinkage."
3.0,The stud is too tiny and the stem was bent when it got shipped. I thought it came as a pair when it is meant for one ear.
3.0,Panties fit great and are super comfortable but the seem ripped out after only one wear. The legs also don’t come down as far as what is shown on the model.
3.0,"Loved the look and feel of these earring. However, I had to put earring bands on the front and back to hold them in my ears otherwise they’d pop out."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:b9474e0ec5678cab62ef824fd3645f5f]] What needs to be done to make this the hat I saw in the ad and make it into a functional hat.<br /><br />UPDATED!!<br />Upon taking this hat camping it worked flawlessly and once it got wet in the lake, it dried perfectly 🤩"
3.0,"Was thinner than expected, and the 3XL fit like a Large. Other than that it would have worked out for what I wanted it for."
3.0,The pin used to attach this is so small it's very difficult to secure to fabric.
3.0,"I love the design and material, but this bra ran way too small. I would need maybe 3 sizes up from the size I ordered. The problem is, I ordered their largest size! The XL fits closer to a Small, which is ridiculous. Hopefully I can get some use out of it once I lose a bit more weight (assuming the ladies get quite a bit smaller). I would only recommend this bra for ladies with a small chest (think 30A to B cup)."
3.0,I own quite a few casios as this is probably my favorite style of watch.<br /><br />But this plastic band doesn't seem durable to me. When it bends it leaves these stretch marks that appears white. Not really appealing and it doesn't rub off well either.<br /><br />Minor issue being that it can be replaced but that's an extra expense I wasn't expecting.
3.0,Looks good but the cool looking green camo will not last. Hardly wear it but the color peels quickly
3.0,After about two months the ban started to change colors.
3.0,"The shade of turquoise is extremely dark, not at all as shown~ and the print and logo are hardly noticeable because of his~ would not recommend in the color I purchased~"
3.0,"5""1"", 110 lbs, smallest size was too big so no compression for me."
3.0,"Got this for my dad. The hat quality is good, it's not floppy. My complaint is the plastic. It's not a harder plastic like shown in the picture that can be easily lifted. It's a little soft ...i'm hoping the wrinkles smooth out after i lay it flat in the sun for a little."
3.0,Nice but expensive for a t-shirt
3.0,I would give 5 stars but I received my dress with a big snag in the fabric and its right in the front of the dress and very noticeable... I'm very sad cause its a beautiful dress otherwise.
3.0,"Snug fit, makes you hot.  I'm putting them in a Good Will box. Never had a moisture wicking shirt that made me hot."
3.0,Size down 2 sizes. Seriously.
3.0,"Beautiful, vibrant colors, but the stitching workmanship is pretty shoddy.<br /><br />What a long, strange trip it’s been!"
3.0,"The color is slightly lighter/more red than the pic showed. The material is very soft, stretchy, and doesn’t stick to you when you sweat. I just wish the black clasp wasn’t there (see pic) but I understand it’s there so it can fit a wide range of wrists sizes."
3.0,"This is an interesting gift, but much smaller than pictured.  I expected the bottle to be about 1 to 1 1/2 inches long, but it's barely half an inch long.  The picture was also taken with some trick lighting, the bottle is clear and the &#34;dust&#34;, which is pellets, appears white."
3.0,"I'm sure these knee pads would be AMAZING on carpet. They stay on good, they are soft, breathable,  easy to put over thicker pants,etc. However our house is tile and these knee pads have no traction on tile so hes still slipping and sliding while trying to crawl. So I'm sure they are great but not for tile"
3.0,beads are beautiful but the clasp doesn't close I will have to restring it myself with a new clasp. Very disappointing
3.0,"The fabric is nice and it's a pretty dress. It's well made and a classic so it can be work for years. That said. I am always a size 6 - 8. Even at my my high weight I'm an 8. I ordered an 8 and it's very snug. It's tretchy so it will work and my weight always fluctuations with 20 lbs. So as it goes down again it will be fine but the 8 is definitely more like a US 4 or 6. I'm 5'6, 34D, 120 - 140. Currently 138 lbs."
3.0,"I’m 6’ wear a 14, got xl for extra wrap fabric, but too short in the front center leg area. Luckily I ordered one that went straight across and that was perfect on me!<br />Nice material, like a heavy jersey material<br />Very flattering cut otherwise"
3.0,Going to order one more
3.0,"While it is a nice looking garment, the lingerie was too small and uncomfortable. My partner removed it soon after putting it on because it was cutting off the circulation. The lace is very pretty and the color was vivid. I would recommend getting it in a larger size than normal so that it fits comfortably."
3.0,You pay for what you get. Poor quality. Hoodie pocket ripped within a day of use. Thin material and sizes fit small.
3.0,"The wrap is not as shown in pictures it’s a sarong with ties. The bathing suit is really cute though! Once I fold the wrap in half and use it as a sarong it’s cute, but it does not in any way look like the dress the model is wearing in the picture!"
3.0,"When I ordered this, there were no reviews or ratings, so I took a gamble. There were a lot of buzz words, so it wasn't clear what I was ordering, but I assumed I was ordering a pullover sweater. What I received was not at all a sweater. I can only describe this as a workout top. I ordered a medium (usual size) and it's definitely a tighter fit than expected. The head hole is a bit small, but it's fine once it is on. I thought with the tight fit, the outline of my bra would be visible and it's not. The print is fabulous. I do believe the seller should better describe this top for future buyers."
3.0,"The design of the front of the cuff links are fantastic. However, the clasps are not the standard type and do not stay on as well as other cuff links."
3.0,I've only worn it once so far. It seems very thin. I don't see it keeping me warm on very cold days.  Maybe meant more for late winter early spring.  The texting response has been good.  I have long fingers which feel like they are stretching them out so I am not sure on the durability.  However at the price point I wouldn't be upset if I got a season out of it.
3.0,"This bag is cute. However, it came with dents in the material. Very upset. I don’t understand what these marks could be from."
3.0,"Nice, easy beachwear."
3.0,Very awkward fit.
3.0,"The straps rub the sides of my foot uncomfortably, but after a few uses and breaking them in they get better. They do the job for a decent price"
3.0,the golden buttons and blue ones werent there lol
3.0,"Great bag, but horrible zippers. After the 3rd week both of them broke off... *note to manufacture, YOU SHOULD USE BETTER QUALITY ZIPPERS!"
3.0,"I like the idea of this cardigan,  and it looks great... until I put it on.  It really adds weight to my middle.  I tried it tied and untied.  Just isn't flattering on me at all."
3.0,My husband said they were to uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,Super cute but runs small so size up.
3.0,"this was a really great fit for my little sister (she's 5""1, weighs about 100 lbs, 32A chest size)."
3.0,So so very small
3.0,Mine came with dark stains which I am still trying to remove. The steel is softer than I expected; scratches easier than other similar bracelets. The locking mechanism on the clasp (pressing a button) opens  too easily.<br /><br />Fitting the bracelet to the  lugs on my Casio was no easy task. I had to pry the ends open a considerable amount to get it to fit.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how easily the bracelet scratches. First hour wearing it I rested  my hand on a paper on my desk and it scratched the bottom of the bracelet.
3.0,"Pretty print, Love the top but we got a large for my daughter and it fits more like an extra small. Ended up giving it to her friend who weighs under 100 lbs. Bottoms are cut real small in the back too. But the price is great if you are a tiny girl."
3.0,"Sadly it arriver broken.... :-(<br />Cute idea, but little quality control."
3.0,mine looks small the chain doesnt look anything like the one in the picture. it was not what i was expecting at all but i do like it
3.0,Yikes! I bought 2 joggers. One bad quality and one good quality. The material shown was the poor quality.
3.0,its ok. The material seem like poor quality. The wrinkles still have not come out. I don't think i would but this brand again.
3.0,The fabric is cheap. I got a XL (I am a large) it fit fine other than around my back. I cant stretch my arms forward or else it will rip. Around the shoulder is ware the arms connect. I can feel the stitching witch is vary uncomfy. But the socks were vary soft and fit perfect
3.0,Material is shinier than expected.
3.0,My son loved it but the hook is kind of fragile for kids to wear and broke easily. Would be fine for an adult.
3.0,Some serious quality control issues here. I bought a pack of size 10 pajamas. They both say size 10. The black pajamas are significantly smaller than the navy pajamas and the pants are too short for my average sized 6 year old.
3.0,After one wash this started to fade.
3.0,"Great, authentic product but display box mangled"
3.0,Not very water resistant
3.0,"I only gave this three stars. The fit was fine. The colors were nice, BUT it itches like crazy around the neck line. I washed it and it still itches....very uncomfortable."
3.0,"Seemed like a women’s large? Zipper was on the wrong side for men’s, short arms and short torso"
3.0,"I ordered an extra large instead of a large, but the item is so small."
3.0,I like the shoes but the lining is starting to peel and they're slightly bigger than expected but I like that the straps are elasticy.
3.0,I love how light and flows and perfectly fit these pants are. I will say that they are quite thin- perfect for spring and summer- but they cray very easily. I wore them twice and already need to shave link off of them.<br />Also be careful not to wear any patterned underwear. They are slightly see-through!
3.0,"The dress was too big. I usually get clothes adjusted once I receive if the fit is not perfect, but it was very big and so I just gave it away.<br /><br />I also received the wrong color. The seller did compensate me for that though.<br /><br />The dress is very elegant and can be dressed up for a dinner or dressed down."
3.0,Good looking glasses but seriously affects my quality of seeing. Almost questionable if you should drive in them.
3.0,"The cover up is cute, but it's def not one size fits all or even most.  I am giving my to friend who is alot smaller.  I am not huge, 5'7 and wear a 12 and this was entirely too small for me"
3.0,The Picture is for a black jersey and the one I got is navy blue ir may be good to update for the real color
3.0,"I returned this necklace since it was not allergy-free and my wife got red skin. But it is so beautiful! If your skin is sensitive, spend more to get an allergy-free one."
3.0,Cute but ran to small
3.0,love the shirt but its HUGE! I ordered 24m and the neck swoops past my 17m old sons collarbone. Its also very long to be sizes at 24m- more like a 2 or 3T
3.0,Sorry..sizing was off
3.0,"These leggings are really cute with the sheer panels on the side. The fabric and construction of these leggings are just okay though. The waistband rides a little low in the back and the fabric is a tiny bit thin for my taste. It is not sheer (at least as far as I can tell), but I prefer leggings with some compression to to them. I have a couple of other leggings from this brand and the so-so construction and fabric quality of these is consistent with the others I have."
3.0,The belt looks nice in person.
3.0,"This looks amazing on, however the positioning of the neck is such that if you sit in an office for work, over time it rubs your neck almost raw. It’s fine when standing, only an issue for people who sit most of the day. Dress looks great, I won’t be returning it for this reason but I won’t wear to work again unless it’s a day I’ll be moving around more."
3.0,"It was a different material them expected and white on the inside , very thin but does fit well and look well , I would recommend"
3.0,"So... the style is really cute and, like others have reported, the top is really stretchy. I have really broad shoulders and it would have been fine (I usually don't fit into things like this). It's pretty comfortable...HOWEVER, the dress is 100% see through. It's almost like wearing cloudy plastic wrap. I was wearing nude underpants and a skin-colored sticky bra and you could even see those. It was impressive just how much you could see. Unless you're prepared to show everyone the outline of your undergarments or add a liner on the inside yourself - steer clear."
3.0,"Lively pattern and easy to wear. But I didn't realize there isn't a pocket in which a filter can be inserted -- I missed that. But bc the virus is way out of control where I live (Florida), I've severely limited my trips out of the house, esp any when I'd be around others for more than a few minutes.<br /><br />And bc our weather has been esp humid for weeks, with months to go, I've discovered the best thing for me is to wear at least a lightweight disposable or an N95 under a more decorative mask such as these. I trash the inner mask that is sweat-soaked and if my exposure has been minimal, I carefully fold the outer reusable mask to wear again.<br /><br />When I say minimal, I mean I've used the drive-thru to pick up prescriptions or the occasional fast food, or at my vet, the tech comes to my car and gets the cat carrier from the back seat on passenger side. I discuss my cat's needs w/vet by phone and pay that way, too. Cat returned to car in same manner.<br /><br />These masks washed nicely and there was no shrinkage."
3.0,The picture shows more of a heathered color. It is solid black. Thinner cord on the hoodie also.  I like it just not as much as the photos.
3.0,"My head (7 3/8"") was too big for this hat."
3.0,Good fit but came apart after first use. Zipper got stuck in sequins and was fun to take off. Fringe also falling off at bottom of dress. Beautiful colors
3.0,The shirt it’s self is good quality and soft. The design is very thick plastic. It doesn’t lay nice on because of how thick the plastic design is. I tried to return it but they just refunded my money. Which I’m happy about.
3.0,i was hoping for a sweater but look most like a tunic top so kept it but had it altered shorter
3.0,"Wore this for a summer wedding and got several compliments. Fit was expected, but the sash was rather flimsy. Would also be good for a cocktail hour type of situation."
3.0,"These rubber slippers had a very strong chemical odor when they were brand new.  I let them sit outside for several days, exposed to the sun and rain, before that odor went away.  After that, these became dependable shower sandals, perfect for taking to the gym.  They are well made and should last a long time."
3.0,The watch was easy to set up not difficult and confusing steps like other digital sports watches. My only negative on the watch is that it is rather small on a man’s wrist looks more like a child’s watch. Time keeping so far is right on target.
3.0,This top doesn't look that great on the body. It makes me look wide and shoulders are too big..<br />Fabric is not that soft.
3.0,I’ve been wearing large boxers for most of my adult life. I decided to buy some new ones. This brand definitely runs small. I sent the large back and bought extra large. They are not what you would call a “relaxed fit:” even the extra large became a little tight when you sit down. I’m hoping with time they will stretch out a little a become more comfortable. They look and feel nice but I recommend one size up when ordering. They were delivered promptly and properly packaged.
3.0,"Much brighter than shown in picture, was looking forward to a pale color, but the top is highlighter red, and they sent an 18 months shirt and 2t short. Seems like a good quality."
3.0,Too big for a toddler.  My 2 year old kid has a large head  (98th percentile) and these are way too big.  They’ll be Great little sunglasses  when he’s a few years older.
3.0,Like the dress itself but it is way too big!
3.0,"I ordered a L in eggplant, and the fit is too big. I measured the chest of the coat and it is 46”, more like an XXL."
3.0,Didn't fit correctly. But it will do. It runs small.
3.0,"So overall this dress is just fine, not great but not horrible. A few things that shoulda be known from my experience with this dress is the sizing for me was slightly larger than my actual size. I ordered a Large, and it was a little big on me(I am usually a size large). Second, and most importantly, this dress is thin, so if your intent is to not show complete strangers everything the good Lord gave you, do NOT wear this dress without a slip or something underneath. Otherwise, it is okay. I realize that it’s not really my style, but I wanted to try something new. Both my husband and son said it looked like something an old lady wears when she brings out tea and lemonade to her husband while they sit out in rocking chairs on the porch. So yeah, not really what I was going for. It is light and comfortable, the buttons are decorative only, and it does seem to wrinkle easily. But overall, it’s not a bad dress, and it looks better on some women who aren’t me."
3.0,Fit perfect but the under material of the coat is super itchy and rough. The button latch on the front was way too small so buttoning and unbuttoning it was a chore
3.0,Fits smaller then advertised.
3.0,Was too stiff in sneaker I trimmed it down and it still felt weird and uncomfortable
3.0,This outfit looks cute on my baby but it's shear material very thin so would not recommend buying it in cold weather.
3.0,I really like the style. I don’t like the poor sewing inside. You can see loose threads. Also it’s a little too hard on the inside edges.
3.0,"Got XL, still a little small"
3.0,"The green isn't the same green as the picture It was more of a lighter lime color, but the pink and blue looked really nice."
3.0,"They are ok...not the best or the worst. I like how tight they are... but they are thick cotton...so if it is hot and humid out, be prepared to peal them off."
3.0,Had to glue the plastic lens (not glass) almost immediately. For this low price you can't expect more. Looks much better than you would think though for the price.
3.0,The light fell out the first day I had it.
3.0,"I really wish I hadn't bought these. The reason is this: one of the hinges doesn't work properly and when I fold the temple back, it doesn't close smoothly. This portends trouble down the road.  I don't expect these to last very long due to wear and tear brought about by misalignment of the hinge. They look okay and feel pretty good, but the price is way too high for something that doesn't work properly.  I have a pair of discount store glasses I bought for $6.99 that are better than thiese.  Too late to return it now."
3.0,Lots of room love it .so easy to keep up with
3.0,"I wanted so badly to LOVE this dress! Honestly, I would have if it were made in a petite size. It was just too long for someone who's 5 1"
3.0,I love the wallet itself. Product was exactly as described. This product however cannot hadle contious use. The zipper breaks easy.
3.0,"Works okay, doesn’t handle water that well."
3.0,"I liked the concept and thought we could use it on our month long trip to Italy/Portugal.  When we were doing our packing  the night before our flight, we discovered that the opening, once locked on the top, was still not tight enough to be secure as we expected.  The grommets need to be set back about another 1/2 - 3/4 of an inch to really tighten it up.  We pulled on the nylon belt and saw that it was possible.  With that being said we knew that someone could get into it with a pair of thongs, etc. and remove things through the opening if they wanted to.  We thought about putting our money into a water bottle inside of it but the last thing anyone needs on a long travel trip is more bulk!<br /><br />We ended up taking it as just another obstacle for a thief in case someone did get a hold of our things!  It was more like a place we knew to put our legal and travel docs, our money and credit cards but because we ended up putting the entire bag in the safe anyway.  But, we could have used any carry bag or pouch for that matter.  We ended up keeping it inside our Osprey backpack if we had to keep it on our person during travel days and we never used is as a backpack on its own.  It would have been a bit too much to get in and out of it if we were shopping, etc.  We personally didn't find a real situation or need for it on our trip as we expected.  We also never put a knife or anything like that to test it out; no need for it on our type of travel/use."
3.0,"The dress itself is cute but even though the reviews said it was long enough, it wasn't for me. I'm 5'11 and wear between a 10-12. I ordered the red wine in a large. My ankles were showing by a solid 4 inches. Returning."
3.0,I need it for an African attire event
3.0,It’s nice but won’t recommend it on a daily bases
3.0,A little wide fitting.
3.0,It fit very well and I'm 5'11 270 Lbs. It's very soft and comfortable. Not see through at all. The only downside is that it has absolutely no support. If it has even a little bit of support for the bust it would be a fantastic product.
3.0,"Sure, it protects the lense.  Though it takes no time for the black finish to come off and leave you with shiny silver accents.  For the price of this thin piece of metal you’d think the finish would hold up better.  Black sharpie touch up required."
3.0,"Firstly, I really like the rounded corners idea. Nothing to cause poking hazards as typical with other kinds of umbrellas. Plus, the perimeter of the umbrella has a reflective material so it's easy to spot at night. Secondly, the spring action to open and close is pretty good. The handle is large and easy to grip. The canopy does open to about 40"" in diameter. It's great for one person, a little tight for two people.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />Folding it up! It's not easy. And the hard part is left out in the diagram showing how to close the umbrella. Every other umbrella I've owned is fairly easy to close, adjusting the folds, rolling up, and clinching with a snap or velcro tie. But the material on this one does not naturally fall well for folding. It takes a while to straighten out the material folds so that it will roll up neatly. Otherwise, you will have many wrinkles in the material that could compromise water resistance. It took me a little over TWO MINUTES to fold it up properly, versus 20 seconds with my favorite traditional umbrella (Leighton). While there is a nice sleeve to stow the umbrella, you have to make sure you roll up the umbrella tightly & cleanly for it to fit. Given the surface area of the umbrella, I would have expected it to be about 2"" shorter when folded. So, it takes up more room to store than you might like.  Despite the description claiming ""light weight,"" I'd call this a medium-heavy weight, but hopefully that means quality materials. As for performance, the fabric seems to be coated. Water resistance is good, but it's anyone's guess how long it will last. I got my umbrella for $11 on discount, so for that price I'd give this a 4-star rating. But for the list price, it's 3 stars."
3.0,I like that they have a rubber sole for gripping.  They do run on the small side.
3.0,"It's coming in good size, but the cluster of the pearls are not as shine as expected."
3.0,Made out of clothe
3.0,"Cute dress, but I didn’t realize the top and bottom skirt were such different fabrics. I didn’t love it. The skirt was stretchy and fun though."
3.0,"Runs VERY small.. petite as much as tiny ... I've purchased this brand before and love my others, but not this. Weird fabric too.. of course it's synthetic, but it feels like a plastic bag."
3.0,I bought these for my 4 yewr and who has relatively small feet but they couldn't fit her OR her little sister who has a whole size and a half smaller. The bands have no stretch so they're little feet can't push through the sandal. And it's even worse if your child struggles with putting shoes on like my youngest who is autistic. They are super cute but almost unrealistic with the fit.
3.0,"I bought the black belt and although it was very cheap, I feel like it looks cheaper, could have bought it for less at forever 21 or somewhere else. It gets the job done, but the buckel is a little bigger than I thought it would be. I'm keeping it but wouldn't buy it again"
3.0,The calf was big enough but the foot area was super tight
3.0,"Great transaction. haven't worn them yet but, I did try them on and they seem to fit ok. One thing I did notice, which is something I have noticed with all of the shoes that are at a lower price then others, is that there is no support or a nice cushion soul. I realize the price is a lot lower than others but, the souls need more support. it would then be a much more comfortable fit. I wouldn't think it would cost that much more. to improve on that."
3.0,I THOUGHT IT WAS COTTON...DISAPOINTED IT WAS NOT FLOOR LENGTH...COLORS WAS..BEAUTIFUL THOUGH 😉  ❤  👍
3.0,OK this product was neat once you couple put it together. You wouldn't think that it would be hard to put these together but you would be wrong. The only instructions they give you is &#34;break and shake&#34;. That's it. It took four grown adults to put 6 caps together. Lol<br />Also they are not very big. Some of the teenage boys that they were for didn't fit in them.
3.0,Runs large; order smaller if you want a cuter look. I didn’t exchange just because it took so long to arrive. Washed and dried on delicate to shrink it a little.
3.0,Nice pieces but bad quality<br />the bend broke easily the very next day
3.0,"So the designs are cute and as advertised. The only thing I don't like it the placement.  Some of them are too low on the mask so it doesn't look as cute as it would if it were higher up. :/ and the masks are kind of large. It goes all the way up to right under my eyes.  If the design was placed better, and the masks weren't so big I'd like them alot more"
3.0,Did not keep...great fabric but even the small size was HUGE!! I ordered medium first and returned for small but they were made for giants...
3.0,"I planned on wearing this as part of a Halloween costume and it worked for that, but, wow, did it fit weird. I am tall but have a short torso. I can only say that the waist fell around my rib cage rather than my waist and I looked like a cookie jar. The belt doesn't stay buckled. Probably needs a snap on it as well. And the neckline had a strange fold at the crease. I am going to take it apart and resew it as just a skirt. Just be warned that if you are buying for actual dresswear, you will probably have to alter it or rework it accordingly."
3.0,"It does the job! Unfortunately, it’s all synthetic material and makes my legs itchy at the end of the day. One more thing, I wear 6.5 shoes and the foot part is way too big and the toes area loosens after an hour of having the socks on and for the rest of the day that area is baggy."
3.0,"Well made, but much small than I had thought it would be. Bag has a magnetic closure in front. Also have a zipper at top to keep contents safe. Able to hold quite a bit of stuff. Two interior pockets. One has a zipper and one doesn't."
3.0,"The purple is way darker than the listing photo. Not super happy with how dark it is. It’s very soft material though so it’s quite comfortable. I also have a thin neck so I have to wear it on the tightest snap. Other than the color issue, it’s a nice piece for the price!"
3.0,Good material but bit too tight and very comfortable. Hopefully it will loosen up after a few wash.
3.0,This is such a cute dress but the back by the zipper sticks out a bit and the stitching underneath the silver stripes are a bit itchy by the waist area. You could potentially remedy that with a slip underneath but it would have to be a short slip due to the cut-out by the knee in the front.
3.0,"THESE ARE NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!! I bought these specifically for the waterproof. I need shoes I can wear while watering outside. They were wet inside in no time,  and I was just walking through my grass."
3.0,"I returned as it was too small and tight, I wanted a baggier tunic and I'd already ordered an XL.  It was a little thinner than I expected too."
3.0,Good size over all. A little on the thin the back side
3.0,"Jacket is really a lot shorter than it shows on the model. It hits right around the waist, not at the hips. So it’s more of a crop jacket.<br />And the pockets are really kind of far back, so they’re awkward to put your hands in.<br />However, that being said, it’s super soft and has to be one of the softest and cutest jackets I’ve ever touched. And the hood is great. The sleeves are a good length, and the jacket zips fine. For a smaller woman/or teenager (with smaller breasts - mine are DD’s), it would be a really great jacket."
3.0,"This is so cute. Way small & very thin...but flattering. AS soon as I lose 40lbs, it will work."
3.0,"It's a really beautiful corset, fabric is nice and soft, shows off my boobs and everything else, but the only problem I'm having is<br /> doesn't do much for my lower abdomen, in fact it looks almost like an open umbrella (and my hips are not that small 40&#34;)<br />Try different ways to adjusted but nothing, I know it will eventually mold to my body with daily use, but I had it and use it (at home only) for a long time now and I still looking like I'm hiding an small umbrella under there!"
3.0,"I didn't realize how small it was. I used my dime to compare and it's the exact size (not counting the top part of pendant). I'll keep it, but I'm still in search for a little bigger than this"
3.0,"This bracelet fits my ten year old daughter perfectly. It's too bad that I bought it for myself. Just a warning to all, it runs small!! It is very pretty though..."
3.0,"i am excited about this suit. it is flattering to my apple shape body. the only problem i have is that it is a size to big, i ordered a size up from large because i wanted to make sure it fit and it turned out to be to large. so order true to size in my experience."
3.0,Its small length wise and the arm sleeves were very tight and its almost see thru.
3.0,Material wasn’t good quality
3.0,"All the plugs are pretty however, they’re super short and fall out of my ears constantly. I was super excited about the wood pairs because all I’ve ever worn is wood. They’re the best material in my opinion as they’re light, they stay in, and they don’t produce any odor. The wood plugs in this pack made my ears smell to high heaven and they got crusty as though they were getting infected. I’m not sure what he issue is. I haven’t had that problem as much with the stone pairs, but they still get pretty stinky which isn’t common with that material. I’ve since threw the wood pairs away."
3.0,For the price I couldn't expect much more.
3.0,THese were huge. Read the specs first to make sure u really want giant ones. But they appeared to be fine otherwise.
3.0,"The neck gaiter fits right and snug. Fits just right, but if you’re expecting Rick & Morty to be at the center don’t lol. It’s Pickle Rick at the center. Rick & Morty sit way too low. The shipping is also a lie. They say one day or two days, but it takes longer than that I waited a week. Hence the three stars. No issue, because it still arrived. Other than that great print, made with a light to medium nylon material. Good stuff."
3.0,It's more like a square in reality. Doesn't look like the picture
3.0,Quality good but runs very small
3.0,This top is cute and seems to be made well. I just didn't like how it looked on me!
3.0,"These are cute but higher than I thought. I probably needed a half size up, my toes felt so squeezed in."
3.0,"I am 5ft4in, 120lbs.<br />There were a few frays I found. It’s one size listed as oversized. I am typically a size XS-S in tops, it fit me perfectly, but not oversized. Has a nice stretch to it. I think for a $7 sweater, it’s actually not that bad. I’m impressed.<br />I docked one star for not being oversized and running pretty small.<br />I docked a second star because it arrived with a large stain. I didn’t see it at first, but thankfully noticed before leaving the house. I’ll be returning and repurchasing a new one."
3.0,They fall down because the top part lost it's stretch almost immediately! Wish they had lasted!
3.0,"This dress is cute. I purchased white and the fabric is very thin. Even with nude underwear, you can still see through and see outlines. Not sure if it’s worth the money for the thin, cheap material but it’s functional as a cute summer dress. Fit true to size for me."
3.0,"These seem to be good quality and will probably be comfortable but they run small, really small.  I wear a 10 1/2 so I ordered an 11.  They were at least one size too small.  I sent them back and ordered a size 12.<br /><br />BIGGEST CONCERN- the pair that I was shipped was very clearly a pair that someone had bought and worn for a short period and then returned.  The tread was slightly worn, there were those plastic tags still on the sandals  and then new tags and labels attached."
3.0,"I use a shoulder messenger bag sometimes and one ripped off. They're really cute, just don't lightly manhandle them."
3.0,I hope she will wear it.
3.0,Shows too much in my shoe. Material was thin.
3.0,"This is not a dress!! This is a shirt. This could only be a dress on someone who is shorter. I am 5'8&#34;, 135lbs, slightly muscular physique. The fabric is a polyester type, not a movable sheerer like I had hoped, and it is full of static!"
3.0,"Pretty basic..not a fan of the ribbed design which I don't think you can see in the pic. One review I read said ""cute with jeans or dress pants for work"". It's more like cute with anything you'd wear to clean the garage. It's not cute. It's no boho. It's an ok shirt that I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,They work alright.  Nothing to brag about.  The shoe horn is a little flimsy.
3.0,"It's just a bit short, it comes above the knees, one or two more inches and it would be perfect for me."
3.0,Quality product and good value for the price.
3.0,Comfortable but shrinks
3.0,After 3 months of less than daily use one lense fell out. This was inevitable when after receiving it I noticed the top right corner of the right lense didn't sit flush. However since I am not looking out of that corner I overlooked that. After falling only once and from a height of less than 1 foot the lense fell out. While the glasses are great for driving in the sun and with the reflection from oncoming headlight. If I have to spend $20+ every 3 months it is not worth it.
3.0,I didn't look close enough at the photo. It has two earring hooks not a necklace clasp. So I need to modify it into a necklace you hook around your neck. But it's cute and will work once I can get someone to put a clasp on for me
3.0,I love it but haven't found pants and shoes to go with it yet.
3.0,A little too loose for my liking. Not as supportive as I would like.
3.0,I love the pattern and material. I just didnt like the way it fit me. I like a lower cut.
3.0,"Super inexpensive casual dress. I read the reviews and ordered a Large, turns out, the Medium would have fit better. I'm returning it, I won;t exchange the material isn't nice enough for me to want a replacement. I recommend ordering true to size. I'm a pretty standard US Medium. Might have kept it if it were a better fit."
3.0,"Not the best quality overall.  The stamped wings like the rest of the hat, don't look so good."
3.0,Warm gloves but the touch screen fingers aren't sensitive enough to play games or even flip pages in my Kindle app.
3.0,cheap matrieal
3.0,The quality and image is beautifully designed; however the threader chain is too short to be secure.  I will be returning it.
3.0,I wanted to love this mask but it simply does not fit comfortably.  When I tried it on the left eye is almost completely covered making it more like a pirates mask.
3.0,Nice but pulls on hair and everything it touches and comes loose often
3.0,"My gf loved it, but it broke on her after her 2nd time wearing it, so she had to improvise to fix it. The metals on it are cheap, so beware."
3.0,The color is right exactly on. However the quality is not what I expected. The zipper is very industrial. I gave it as a gift. It is still holding up- but I just expected something nicer
3.0,Its a good jacket I didn't expect it to be satin and it runs short I ordered a 3X and it fit but it was short good for the one the wear for a halloween party probably wouldnt order again
3.0,1. I cannot believe this is how I received this pajama set.... Inside out wrinkled as all can be the pant leg is not even pulled out.<br />2. It's a nice set and I going to keep it but come on this is for Christmas!<br />3. The shirt has no stretch to it you might want to go up a size pants are perfect.<br />4. Material is very nice.
3.0,The buckle and belt is shedding. I have another belt bought same time that has held up well. Was good while it lasted
3.0,"The dress is nice - the white part is puckering right now, but I think I can fix that with an iron.  If not, it's still okay.  It is definitely dramatic looking.  But much more comfortable than I would have thought.  The material isn't crepe but it will pass in dim light for better quality fabric."
3.0,"Great shoe laces, however the locking mechanism is very hard to place on the laces and when you are finally successful the locking unit only works for a short time.-"
3.0,it's too big- the sizing is mixed up
3.0,sleeves are a little snug it isn't as comphy as other brands
3.0,"The shorts fit fine. The waist of the top is a bit too loose and big. The chest of the top is too tight. In other words, if you have a bigger chest and smaller waist, this top doesn't fit well on either part. It was cheap though, so worth it for a few wears."
3.0,My son is 11 years old and size XXL was super tight
3.0,The hat was folded and smashed when it arrived...
3.0,"This dress was just okay, no real redeeming qualities about it.<br /><br />The material felt very rough and constricting, even though it looks soft in the pictures, it is not! Also, the dress needs a slit somewhere, the skirt part of the dress is column style and quite constricting when you are trying to walk.  I ordered the small and there was at least 4 inches of additional fabric on the ground that I would have needed to get hemmed. (I am 5'3&#34; 1/2) It also was gapping weirdly in the chest and shoulders, like it was almost too big on the top, but fit well in all the other areas.<br /><br />I didn't like it enough to be bothered with the extra alterations it needed, so it was returned."
3.0,Nice robe but returned and spent a bit more for a different softer robe:)
3.0,"Normally these watches are very reliable and will last several years. The last one I purchased failed after one year.<br /><br />That being said, I will still recommend this as a purchase."
3.0,I appreciate the fact that this is sold for a less price but unfortunately I do not like this product as the Mickey faces all have disappeared within the first week of having it and only wearing it twice.
3.0,The dress looks to be well made and the material is beautiful. Will NOT wrinkle. Would pack beautifully. But it runs small. Unfortunately I need to return it.
3.0,Seems like a high quality socks. However it appears one of them have developed a run or a hole for some reason.
3.0,"I like it fine. I can’t rave about it simply because the design is not exceptional in any way, but it works. I like the fabric quite a lot. It’s warm mid-weight fabric. The pockets are actually a single, roomy, kangaroo pocket.  I ordered a medium pink, and received an accurately sized and colored shirt. I am 5’7 136lb."
3.0,"I returned it. The sleeves looked great and the material was nice, but unlike the picture, there is absolutely no shape. It is a perfect pillow case shape. No tapering, no contouring, no fitting around the bust. It's just a rectangle with fantastic sleeves. For some body types, this would work fine and look great! I need the waste to taper in like in the picture to look right on my body. I almost kept it and got it tailored because there's enough room in the fabric to do it, but I didn't want to invest more money into it."
3.0,"Same as other reviews, product is not the same as picture shown.  Product is good quality for the money but be aware that you are not receiving what you ordered.  The UV protection and polarization both work well, just with they would ship the item shown or change the images."
3.0,"Arrived broken, seconds aren't displayed properly. Sending back, will update if replaced.<br /><br />Update: Up to 3 stars for quick replacement. Light is a little dim so I chose to go with the Casio Illuminator. Very happy with it so far."
3.0,Cut when paired with my earings but not for everyone
3.0,"I love this bracelet but it's been kind of hit or miss when buying replacements. I wear it every day so it gets worn out, as expected, but my last two replacements have been disappointing. One won't stay tightened, no matter what I do, and I've almost lost it several times. One has unraveled, and I'm not crafty enough to rebraid it. I love it though."
3.0,"These are one size fits most, I'm 165, 5'7&#34;, normally wear a 10 or 12 depending on the style. These are comfortable but after wearing for a few hours they start to slip down and the crotch sags so I'm having to constantly hitch them up. The print looks kind of cheap and fakeish, especially the fake holes. If they would stay up I'd give them 4 stars. But for the price for two, not too bad."
3.0,Quality was less then expected
3.0,"These are very thin, but still decent quality..."
3.0,I like the product a lot and fits as expected. But it took over a month to get so if you want to wait it is a nice shirt.
3.0,"I ordered the white one and the green. I loved them. But then I washed both of them and the white one shrunk into a shirt while the green one is still intact and can be worn as a dress. I’m 5’3, 138lbs and the Small was perfect. Flowy, comfortable. Flattering. Prepare for a hit or miss I guess"
3.0,"These came defective on the left ear piece; i tired to tighten it up with the tool that they sent with them but it’s not a screw loose, the whole ear piece rotates; I don’t think it’s something I can fix; I like how light these glass are but they are slightly loose so if I bend over when I have them on they fall off but if you just need them for driving or non-active wear they are comfortable. I need to contact eye love to see it they will switch them out for me."
3.0,This is worth the buy
3.0,It was not white like the photo. It’s very off white and practically beige/antique looking
3.0,Normal bandannas. I wasn't expecting anything unusual.
3.0,Top is way too small across the shoulders. I am 6'5&#34; / 210 and I already ordered XXL. All-in-all not very happy with the fit and weight of this product.
3.0,"From the pictures, I thought I would be getting something a little more sturdy. I know it is a soft gel case, but it seemed a bit too thin, and it was a bit loose, not fitting snugly and wiggling around a bit on the sides. It irritated me whenever I held my phone. I stayed with my old case instead. Also, the sides were clear, not white like it seems in the picture. On the plus side, the design was very attractive, exactly as shown, and the buttons weren't covered by the case. Decent, just not solid enough for me."
3.0,The material used on the insole is slippery. My feel slide around in the boot more than any other hiking shoe I have had.
3.0,"Looked horrible on me. Super baggy medium. I am 5'9"" 34-28-40 chest,waist,hips.  Curvy but this dress was way over sized and the design in person wasnt that good looking."
3.0,It was much shorter than I expected but I am going to try to figure a way out to extend the legnth
3.0,"Just fine, too much for the price."
3.0,Very sheer. Need a camisole under white shirt which defeats purpose of summer tee.
3.0,"The fabric is a heavy weave, and the pattern is exactly as pictured.  The shirt has a good trimmer fit, but the sleeves were A bit short for me. But, I hav elong arms and that is to be expected.<br /><br />UPDATE: I washed it once. In cold water, hand wash, line dry.  The shirt shrank, A LOT! The sleeves are at least 2 inches shorter.  Now it will have to be rolled at the sleeves.  The fit is about an inch trimmer around the waist too.  And I know I didn't gain weight this summer!  Oh well....  Down to 3 stars."
3.0,Not as big as I thought. But it is pretty
3.0,"These beanies are probably meant for a preteen, they seemed small and had to be continually pulled down over my ears again.  Cute style, but I guess I should have read the fine print on the sizing."
3.0,"I like the colorfulness, but the proportion between flowers and chain is off, the flowers are on the heavy side, makes the chain very thin and flimsy."
3.0,Cute but runs a little small.
3.0,The quality was not as good as I expected.
3.0,"The fit was okay, but the fabric was extremely thin.  I don’t want to wear a slip under it in the summer.  I returned it.  Also beware of weirdly sewn seams on the sides."
3.0,I have had trouble with China made clothes needing to order up multiple sizes just to get an XL in misses. Having tried just ordering XL in the past and received more like a small I decided to size up this time. Well I ordered an XXL this time and it is super huge. I am going to have to totally take it apart and cut it down. The embroidered sleeves are very pretty but the seams and hems are so skimpy and cheaply done. I do like the Boho look so I will force myself to break out the machine and sew. I guess order your regular size this time. So hard to know. One time I ordered a 4X and it was a Medium.
3.0,The top is very long; it hits well below the bikini bottom. Fits as expected.
3.0,"Cute top! It is a lightweight long sleeve. The sleeves can be a bit tight ( and I don’t have large arms either ) and rides up a bit in the front . But for the price, it isn’t bad !"
3.0,These are great. If you have bigger nipples don't buy them. They are extremely tiny. But I think they should put in the description that they are 16g. I'm wearing them because they're cute but they are not 14g and that kinda upsets me.
3.0,Picture and description says and shows yellow and pink.  it is not yellow; it is more orange.  would not have bought it had I known it was orange.
3.0,"The lanyard works however compared to other wrist strap lanyards I have purchased off Etsy in the past the leather is okay quality, but not great, and the silver components look a little cheap.  If you're looking for something functional...go for it.  If you're looking for something aesthetic you may wish to look at other products."
3.0,"Cute, and flowers. Great for spring. The fabric is like a thin polyester.  And almost sheer. It would've been better if cotton."
3.0,The mask itself feels like a thin shirt
3.0,"They are great pants but the elastic band at the waist is extremely tight. I bought the small and the large and it still was not working. I am a regular small/ medium and had to return it. Also, the pants are. It very long; I am 5’10. I feel they would fit someone very skinny and not too tall."
3.0,Too long for my ears.
3.0,Quisiera consultarles como se activa la luz de la esfera de este reloj Aguardo sus comentarios<br />I would like to ask you how the light of the dial of this watch is activated.I wait your comments<br />Send by email<br />arnoldopasik@yahoso mucho.com.ar<br />Thank you
3.0,Cute hat but it was completely smushed to fit into the plastic bag packaging so when it arrived it had dents and creases in it that I couldn't get I out without having to cut the bottom open because it was completely closed. This meant I couldn't use it for the project I was doing which required covering it in fabric. I needed a relatively smooth surface. I ended up buying a full size top hat for my project anyway and my 10 yr old GodDaughter wore this one as is.
3.0,"It is a nice enough bag, especially for the purpose I am using it for, an emergency document bag. But as others have mentioned, it had an odor so bad, that I had to leave it outside for a week before it could come into my house. During this time, it rained and the inside stayed dry."
3.0,"I bought 2, 1 was really nice, 5 star quality great glasses for the price<br />second one was not polarized or anything.  Cheep $.2 glasses. would rate 2nd pair 1 star<br />averages to three stars<br />buy at least 2 or else this is a massive gamble"
3.0,"The dress looks nice, the fabric just isn't what I expected. Its thicker than what i thought, and it has a glossy pattern in the top. It does fit nicely. Has nice shape."
3.0,Fit good and comfortable
3.0,"I bought these Ishvaku Bohemian raffia straw earring getting ready for the warmer summer season as jewelry accessories to go with my cool sundresses, especially if you're a fan of Yoga, Palates or East Indian Cultures in general. These are very summer cool ivory color that pretty much goes with everything you put on, and definitely will help accentuate your overall looks, they are also extremely lightweight, and they're neither too small not too large, so you definitely will get noticed, especially by passerbys 😋😋😋😍😍🤩<br /><br />On the flip side, I don't think these are of the highest quality, and in fact, it appears a little flimsy & things can fall apart easily - not necessarily the whole thing will disintegrate, but a hook or something tiny piece on the earrings could detach from the rest -as it did with a previous Ishvaku trinket-like set of earrings I had bought, one of many trinkets on the earrings severed just from unboxing.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you want something Bohemian, and in general, a fan of the Indian culture & practice yoga on a regular basis, I thing you will enjoy this to your overall jewelry accessories. But, it's not made of the highest quality, as reflected in its price, but it's perfect for a little girl or if you don't have too much expectations as far as its durability is concerned.<br /><br />😒😏😏😔😣Not Recommended😣😔😏😒"
3.0,The glasses looked great however not on me.  That is why I returned them.
3.0,The color is beautiful and it fits exactly as expected but there is no way that is 65% cotton and 35% polyester. It’s probably the other way around. It doesn’t have a cotton feel at all. Almost feels like plastic or spandex. I’m keeping it but I would suggest wearing a shirt under it as it’s not comfortable against the skin.
3.0,good sweatband.  just do not put in washing machine.  it will curl up out of shape and cannot wear.
3.0,As a huge inosuke fan im unsure i still love the plush it came wonderful and very nice quality. fluffy and soft but when i looked at the picture thinking it was just the lighting that made his head look tan but unfortunately it came his head ended up coming tan to be fair that is my fault but kind of disappointed since it was so expensive still recommend.
3.0,It was soft rubber not a hard helmet like the picture looks like. There was a glob of glue in the front and 2 tiny eye holes. The “glass” to see through wasn’t all see through like you’d think. And the light up area wasn’t very bright.
3.0,I purchased 3 different colors. The adjustable sliding buckle is on on backwards on 1 of them.<br />1 of them will not close or open to the combination we set. We may have bumped it before moving the reset button back to A.<br />I gave less than 5 star since I have the above issues with 2 of the 3.<br />Would love to know how to reset it to 000 and start over since it is totally worthless now.<br />Over all the others seem sturdy. I purchased more for piece of mind in the event my zippers fails. I think it would work for that.<br />I do not think it would stop someone from getting into it if they wanted to. But it is a deterrent.
3.0,"Dress is made from a super lightweight T-shirt material (think night shirt quality). At 5’2”, it falls just above my knee. The top (bust) area is ridiculously huge and bulges out at the sides- I’m a 36 DDD- it’s very oddly proportioned- unwearable"
3.0,This bag is good to carry all the essentials. But looks cheap. so returned.
3.0,I got this band on Wednesday and by Saturday the pirate skulls both fell off. I like the way the band fits my little wrist but very disappointing about the skulls
3.0,So idk maybe it’s me but I ordered this thinking it would be a regular gold color but as I’ve been wearing it I’m noticing it’s rose gold. I thought well maybe I accidentally picked the wrong one no big but then I double check and no where in the title or selection does it say ROSE gold plated. Idk I think it’s misleading if it’s rose gold then maybe mention it. It’s a good chain for the price none the less
3.0,The construction of this item makes it very difficult to put on or take off. You have to stretch the neck opening nearly to its breaking point to get your elbow into the armhole and same for taking it off.
3.0,This is an interesting top.<br /><br /> The waffle knit pattern is very soft. The material isn't too thin but definitely not thick. Kept me warm in 40° weather.<br /><br />The pattern is strange because it looks like it's inside out. Nice & flowy in the right areas. Not at all tight in the arms. Hides my love handles & mommy tummy perfectly without making it look like I'm wearing a garbage bag. Classy fit.
3.0,"This is a really cute top, but sizing seems to be a bit off.  Considering ordering another in a larger size."
3.0,"Made a mistake purchasing this.  It is very, very small and very, very shear.  I'm old and big."
3.0,"I’m a little bummed by the quality of the dress given what you pay, in person it feels/looks more like a $15 dress from WM. Definitely need a slip underneath, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a lightweight option for warmer weather. Still looks kinda cute, fits as described."
3.0,Lack luster.  Not well made.
3.0,"Buy a larger size if you like the pajamas comfy, it comes to tight. And what I did not like about this pajamas is the fabric, the pants are for really cold weather and the top is for spring, is light. Makes no sense the combination of materials."
3.0,Really on the small side.
3.0,"Great price for this lovely dress. Only thing is we had to alter it ever so slightly. The arm and neck openings were very itchy to the girls. We added a satin ribbon around it to make it less itchy. Also, in the smaller dress (we got two different sizes for two flower girls in a wedding) we had to add a modesty panel in the front. The existing modesty panel did not go up high enough and cover her little lady bits. We added a two inch section of white satin behind the existing panel to extend it up higher and if you didn’t look for that specific thing you would have never noticed. For the price, I was not miffed that we had to alter in these ways. However, you should not have to fix a modesty panel on a little girls dress. Quality control needs a little help."
3.0,The size runs too large
3.0,"The &#34;olive&#34; color is not olive at all. It's actually brown. I kept it only because it's an ok fall color, but I'm disappointed that it wasn't the color I was expecting."
3.0,"This band was beautiful, but it would not clip into place. The thickness of the band was preventing it from fully locking into place. Had to return it."
3.0,"These are very cute and my son loves them. However, the quality of materials is very poor. They wore out in a matter of weeks. I purchase a superior brand shoe and it's lasted months with the same wear and tear."
3.0,I love the style of the jacket but the hood of it is too pointed it should be more rounded bit besides that its good
3.0,Amazing quality as expected but they run SO narrow. My daughter fits in a 5 in every other brand of shoe but these are SO narrow they don’t fit her even though they are plenty big.
3.0,"Material somewhat thin, without body."
3.0,They fog up way too easily.
3.0,Not as dark as the photo but cute none the less- just too short for me and a bit snug on top (hit quite a bit above the knee and I am only 5'3&#34;
3.0,"For the price, I'm a little disappointed.  The features are good, but the separation between the two bill pockets is flimsy and wants to fall down."
3.0,These pants aren't terrible but fit much looser than the pic shows. If I had ordered a size down they would have been too short
3.0,"Poor quality, poor look, not giftable at all....very disappointing but, hey, you definitely get what you pay for. Not happy."
3.0,It is a nice tie but it was not as bright as the picture showed.
3.0,They are a little delicate for our use.  But having so many in the package they will last awhile.
3.0,Gave 3 stars because they are cute but missing hole for button to go in.
3.0,"We are processing your review. This may take several days, so we appreciate your patience. We will notify you when this is complete. Please note that if the review is about your experience with a third-party seller, we may move it to the seller’s profile page."
3.0,it was okay. But I thought from the pictures it would be a lot prettier.
3.0,"The dress is cute. However, it is too thin."
3.0,Wish the sock was longer and more loose at the top. Too much like a regular ankle socks on with slip grip.
3.0,"These are pretty, but cheaply made. The beads fell off with the first wear and continue to do so."
3.0,ITS AS ADVERTISED AND LOOKS.  JUST THIN AND SMALLISH.  ITS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR MY WRIST AND I AM 5'8&#34; AND HAVE 7.5-8.0 INCH WRIST.  ITS COSTUME LOOKING AND COULD BE MORE DURABLE.
3.0,"A cheap watch but it works and my six year old son likes it. It does tell time but only one day after he got it the latch pin on the watch band buckle broke. It still stays on his had due to the two band holders though.<br />The watch came with no instructions for how to set the time, etc. but another Amazon reviewer passed them on in a comment and I will pass them on to you:<br />&#34;Mine had a tiny instruction leaflet folded at the bottom of the box. Here are most of the printed directions:<br />There are 3 buttons on the right of watch- one top outer protrudes & sets off the flash (B1), the middle is recessed (B2) and the third protrudes from bottom (B3). It says to use a &#34;pen&#34; to press the middle recessed button. FOR MONTH-Press B2 twice to show month, B3 to change month of the year. FOR DAY- Press B2 once to display day & press B3 to change day of month. FOR TIME- Press B2 once again (which is the 4th time now to show hour) &#34;A&#34; for AM and &#34;P&#34; for PM. Press B3 to change hour and AM PM. FOR MINUTES- Pres B2 once and again to show minutes. Press B3 to change minutes. Press B2 once again to show correct time. Press B3 once again to &#34;start&#34; watch. Blinking dots indicate watch is &#34;running&#34;"
3.0,These are beautiful colors and soft velvet but they are all too small for my 8 month old. They each fit differently with the black being the smallest. Super disappointing because they’re really cute.
3.0,"This is a decent shirt for the price, and the fit is not bad, but the stitch at the neckline is a little wonky. The waffle is much smaller than the photos, so I think it looks more like a thermal/pajama shirt. I think if I wash it and dry it, it may shrink and fall a bit better at the neckline. I am 5""7"", 36C and ordered a medium and it is very roomy."
3.0,"Totally different color than pictured so it didn't match the rest of the costume. It wasn't clear how to tie on the tail... you need to belt and it velcros around the belt/belt loop. It would have been nice to know that! Overall, they were cute, but the color was way off- they looked more like grey wolf ears."
3.0,"The pendant is pretty, but not as impressive as I thought for the price. I'm afraid that the recipient will think it was cheap- Looks like something I could have picked up at the teen section of the  department store. It was difficult to see the entire saying, so we printed it out on a card so she would know why we selected it for her. The medallion is lightweight and the chain is very delicate also. Sorry to say I wouldn't have purchased it if I saw it in person."
3.0,"Should have gone one size larger, it didn't fit perfectly but overall pretty cute."
3.0,"Good every day skirt but wish it came in other colors besides this dark indigo.  It's now spring and I want to wear something other than dark colors.  You can wear this practically all year 'round (not middle of winter) but it seems to only come in one color.  Also, elastic is fine at top but begins to stretch out before long. Also, VERY thin denim material. Really would like to see another color in this one."
3.0,Wrong color hat it was blue
3.0,Love the material if only they were a little bigger like a 3x would perfect. I would definitely like a bigger pair and I would recommend this product/company!
3.0,"way smaller than stated, the material is good but none of that matter when you have to return the product. my daughter is 9 so I purchased size M and had to return for the L , which will only last one year because it fit just right but doesn't had any extra room or stretch for a couple of years.  she is average heigh and weight for a 9 year old girl so im assuming due to the size issue she'll be using the adult size in 2 years"
3.0,"The chain holding one of the shoes broke within 3 days of having it in my pocket. I tried to fix it, but the loop on the shoe is very tiny, and won’t fit directly on the key ring. A key ring doesn’t work well if it easily breaks in your pocket. Having said that, it is otherwise quite beautiful is appearance."
3.0,"I didn’t want gold arms or trim, but I wanted lighter colored lenses so I went with the brown.  These lenses don’t look like the picture, they look more like the dark green.  The lenses are too dark for what I was wanting.  If I’d known this was what I was getting, I would have chosen the silver arms and trim.  So not really happy with them."
3.0,Too tight in chest
3.0,Kind of weird. Looks super cute in the picture but I actually don't like it. Will give it away.
3.0,"The back of the holder is not clear as shown in the pictures. It’s opaque black with a permanently-printed logo in the center. If you need something to show both sides of the card, or something unbranded, this is not it.<br /><br />Unfortunate, because it seemed to be a fine card holder otherwise, especially for the price."
3.0,Too tight on the arms and shoulders.
3.0,Great deal! I enjoy the medium size bag the most!
3.0,S/M fits like an xs.
3.0,"Love them, just Beautiful but one of them has a loose clasp. It snaps s*** but I don't think it will last long."
3.0,"The slippers are not all it chocked up to be. I was looking for the best slippers available when I researched this company and willing to pay a premium for good slippers only to find these wearing out in a few months and you lose the cushioning altogether. They are tight if you have an average foot width so order one complete size up;<br /><br />Although they look nice out of the box, it won't last the limited use and time you wear them.  As a quick replacement with no strings attached they are fine though and stain easily on the outside..."
3.0,Very nice but bigger than I expected. Too big for a petite person
3.0,This outfit is so cute . I brought this for my sons 2nd birthday. But the hoodies arms ran too small but the pants for perfect buy a size up
3.0,"Not so sure about this one.  The 30x is a killer deal.  The 10x focus distance is about 5mm, way too close to use much without a light source.  So I wasted $2, big whoop."
3.0,The glasses fit my 7 year old pretty well. He uses them for baseball.  They just don't work underneath a batting helmet or a catchers helmet due to the arms of the glasses sticking out.  They work underneath a ball cap just fine.
3.0,Love everything about this except for how much it shrinks with its recommended washing. It already runs 2 sizes too small. Would give more stars if sizing was better
3.0,"Personally, these socks were for my girlfriend and she's not the type of person to be in the cold weather. Still, she did not feel warm with the socks."
3.0,Soft and pretty material. Too long and the puffs on the shoulders are akward.
3.0,"This dress is 3 quarter sleeve NOT long sleeve. The fit is true to size. The white color is more off-white or ivory, not bright white. Petticoat is needed to have that puffed out ball gown look. If not wearing petticoat, dress will be rather long. Overall I still think the dress is nice for the price however I ended up returning it because I needed a Long sleeve, bright white dress."
3.0,Super cute in picture just not on not as full as pictured in the skirt.  I did end up returning it.
3.0,Good price and quality.But just wish could adjust little more for larger heads probably fits women better
3.0,"I have in the past purchased tips, blouses and a dress or 2 from Jones of New York and I must say this top was disappointing in the fit. I Have always bought a size small in thier products and this just isn't the same."
3.0,Time was not work. But time and worked for a couple hours when I took it off at night put it to go to work was not working
3.0,Fit is way too big even with pads but they are good quality
3.0,Excellent bag for the price. Received with broken zipper on the back
3.0,I really don't like the hat because it is stiff. It is made well.
3.0,"It’s really pretty! It’s just a thin piece of fabric so it’s more fashion than function. I hate to admit it but I didn’t realize the little rubber pieces on the ear loops were so I could adjust the length and I pulled them right off. That made the ear loops way too big but I tied the string behind my ear and it stayed on fine. I saved the rubber pieces and am confident I can get them back on but haven’t tried. confident I can get the rubber pieces back on but haven’t tried, pretty sure it will require a tool of some sort and definitely some motivation."
3.0,"I received this top in a size X-large, and wear a size small. It may work as casual loungewear or a nighty. The fabric is soft, and the crochet work is pretty, albeit heavy for this very lightweight and thin fabric.<br /><br />I think it is the wrong fabric for this style in this size. If I were still heavy, it would be clingy and reveal every bump and bulge. Honestly, I don't think it's an attractive look for me in any size. It is comfortable but looks and feels cheap."
3.0,These shirts are sized small. I even went up a size and it was a little small.
3.0,I bought this bracelet for my daughters for Christmas. All three bracelets have the word crow where crown should be. I don’t have time to send them back and find something else.
3.0,It`s okay... Not very flexible!!!
3.0,I wasn't happy with it. But that just might be me. It didn't go on well and didn't feel comfortable. I returned it.
3.0,"it is nice looking, but material seems really cheap and thin...."
3.0,Not made with good quality
3.0,Love the leather and the black and brown together. The problem for me was the short handles. The crossbody strap was too long and the handles<br />We’re too short. Just not for me.
3.0,"Interesting fit!!! They worked to my delight!! They have this strange high waist —almost like a maternity band,  but it’s stretchy and soft & hides easily under tops —so the waist size is no problem from there down the pants are fabulous, I’m 5’7, the length was good, they’ll be great with lots of shoes or boots"
3.0,The necklace is extremely polished and shiny.
3.0,Just okay. A bit scratchy and they run small.  Would not repurchase
3.0,"nice tent, goes up fairly easily although the poles need to be bent pretty hard to get them in place. Set it up in pretty good rain and wind...totally dry, didn't blow away.<br /><br />The only thing is the price. I'm not seeing the value here. I have a tent I paid $89 for that is comparable. Maybe it will turn into a longevity thing.<br /><br />Also, I had a question for MSR and wrote to them twice, about 2 weeks apart, through their web form. No one got back to me. That's really bad customer service."
3.0,"The color and look was nice and pretty, but the button would open to much as I had it around my shoulders afraid things would fall out, it keep opening"
3.0,The picture shows something that is more of a tan color. In actuality this is more of a brown color. I still like and it have worn it but feel as though this picture is nothing what the actual item looks like
3.0,"I have lost 3 of these. No matter how much i tighten them, it still manages to come loose."
3.0,"The print of this dress was really cute, but the seam of the tiered skirt fell in an awkward spot across the middle of my rear-end, which made it slightly uncomfortable, especially for sitting."
3.0,I think this top is really cute but it gives me cone boobs!  I look like Madonna but not in the good way :(
3.0,feels small to me for pfs and waistline was lil tight
3.0,Snaps apart too easily while wearing
3.0,"They look great, very cheaply made. I used one of them and it broke on 1st use."
3.0,Chep looking to me and not one side fits all...unless you want to look like your getting squeezed! I wear 12 and it fits good and snug...my sister wears 16 and it was way too tight
3.0,"Cute, but turn fingers green fast"
3.0,"Runs big, I got a medium, and it was really loose"
3.0,decent value
3.0,Good for price.  Has a red line through it like it was misprinted.
3.0,I had a great time wearing them but my hand did not fit well. the room for the fingers are to narrow. but It looks great.
3.0,"I love the compression. Really lifts your butt, but they ripped within the first week of having on the inside of leg. Probably will buy another pair. Recommend normal size."
3.0,"I bought this dress and it was to small, and very short to were I need to wear shorts with it. It is tight on the upper part of it, I should have ordered 1 size up I guess."
3.0,This is cute but entirely too big.
3.0,The necklace was much smaller than I was expecting - it is nice but very thin.<br />I also wondered why sent silver extender with gold necklace-doesn’t make since.
3.0,After post arterial angiogram I was pretty sore and unstable and the socks I left with from the hospital provided grip and added confidence while trying to get around in my home so I decided to buy extra socks. These are comfortable and are not constricting but they are shorter than what the pic advertises but I still like them. I have not used the metatarsal pads included in the package so I can't provide an opinion on them.
3.0,"Fits as expected, but the headband is definitely not the same color blue, they clash"
3.0,These are so nice looking. I ordered a medium as per the size chart but too tight. Sent it back. Would probably have to go up to an xl.  I usually wear medium. Definitely order at least one size up.
3.0,"These leggings are super comfortable and adjust appropriately for all activities. Unfortunately, THEY ARE SEE THROUGH despite what others may say. I am in doctoral physics therapy program where we closely analyze squats, lunges, etc. so it was a little upsetting when my husband and friend informed me they could see through them when I was performing certain moves. You'd think active leggings would be made to cover your dignity while being active..."
3.0,Bought for my 12yo to use for virtual school. One pair broke the first day my daughter wore them and the other pair was bent out of shape when we got them.
3.0,"It was shorter than i expected, ended up returning it"
3.0,The boot is very narrow. I purchased them for myself; but had to give them to my niece who has freakishly narrow feet
3.0,"Nice looking, well made and comfy but run small and very narrow"
3.0,"The shirts are ok but not how I expected them to be. The stitching is very defined , so it makes the shirts look a little manly."
3.0,BIgger than expected.
3.0,Smaller than I had anticipated -- barely an inch wide. Some of the lettering is so small it's barely readable.
3.0,"The fit is true to size. However the fabric is not very soft, and the neck line is very unfeminine and unflattering."
3.0,feels so soft and cool
3.0,Honestly the bathing suit was alright but the back was a little bit more showy than I expected. I'd personally prefer something a tad more modest but depends on what you're looking for.
3.0,Almost homemade quality
3.0,"I love the style and print of this suit but it is really large in the bust area. I am not exactly small busted, but not huge, either, but it just seems like way too much material. Also seems to be extra material around the hips that bunches at the waist.  Maybe I am just too short for the cut. I was really disappointed because I wanted to love it! I don't think going down a size would have fixed the problem, either. It seemed well made, just more material than necessary for a spandex item that should have some stretch and give to it."
3.0,"I bought these back when they first came into stores.  I had the Iverson Rewind jersey and the pants matched.  So I had a &quot;outfit&quot; with everything.  Eventually a few of the buttons on the bottom of the pants fell out and I can't figure out how to repair it.  So now they are my sleeping pants and are very comfy.  At the current price, it's a great deal."
3.0,Not as it looks in the picture
3.0,I wish they would have been longer.  Wouldn’t purchase again.
3.0,"The sizing is off -- the decorative cuts are very rough looking, and appear that they will tear if barely touched. I'm not sure it will survive the washing machine."
3.0,"I ordered an XL according to the chart for measurements 35/29/35 and 150lbs<br />I am 40/32/40 and 150 lbs. 5'4""<br />The suit was well made and I really like the zippered wrists and ankles. I thought the back zipper should have more shielding between the back and zipper, the fabric was thin and not very wide and when zipped up, did not lay under the zipper, but folded back under the suit.<br />I found this suit fit well in the chest, legs, arms and hips, although the limb length was a bit long.<br />But, the back of the suit from the shoulders down to the sacrum, had about 2 inches of  air space between the skin and suit. This will negate the insulating purpose of the suit."
3.0,Fits oddly. Baggy in the arms. Ok otherwise.
3.0,Does not come with the interchangeable lens
3.0,"Nice material, but difficult to take out than orhers bands."
3.0,Quality not as expected.  Guess it's ok for the price.  Would have kept if it had fit
3.0,"I liked these gloves, I think they are not good for riding a motorcycle with. I felt like I had pillows on my hands, which was very uncomfortable trying to ride with it made me feel like I didn't have as much control over the bike. They're great with anything except riding in my opinion I sent them back."
3.0,"I'm giving the product an excellent rating for quality and garment strength. I give it a thumbs down for the dozing difference. It comes from China and the sizing chart does show a conversion to help you select the correct size. It might be a good idea to order a size up. I purchased a large, got the conversion of XXL with the actual garment and it was still too small. I am a solid size 12. Had to send it back."
3.0,Its a very heavy bag.
3.0,"This top is a lightweight chiffon, which was expected.  However, it is sized one or two sizes smaller than expected, no doubt Asian sizing."
3.0,thin material. rips easy
3.0,"The shorts are cute. But, pI bought them for my daughter to use at volleyball practice and they were longer than we anticiapated. She thought they seemed a little uncomfortable. Hopefully she will wear them again."
3.0,"I ended up giving this shirt away because if you don't get the perfect size it fits really weird, doesn't hang right on your body!"
3.0,"I bought this jumpsuit to wear for my bachelorette party. It’s a nice low cost outfit, but remember that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Pros –<br />The price was excellent<br />The material had a lot of give and is clingy<br />The jumpsuit was true to size<br /><br />Cons –<br />As other buyers have indicated, the jumpsuit is quite long. I am 5’6 and will be wearing it this with 5 inch heels and the bottom of my pant still grazes the ground.<br />This outfit is thin and because the outfit is so thin, it will cling to EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY<br />This is a backless jumpsuit so you can’t wear this with a bra. I’m a DDD, and because it’s so clingy it’s VERY apparent I’m not wearing a bra.<br /><br />I’m going to pair this with a blazer and a lace bralette.<br /><br />Overall – I would not purchase this item again. It was described as indicated online, but it’s just not the best fit for a curvier girl."
3.0,I was not able to wear this product. The product was smaller than advertised.
3.0,"I like the fabric, but I bought two different Size's and still not a perfect fit, I recommend go 2 size more over USA size"
3.0,This is gorgeous however its cheaply made and  metal silver embellishments literally fell off it as I took it out of the bag and all over the ground. I believe they were supposed to be on the front of it? Disappointed with that but it is pretty.
3.0,"I love that this bracelet comes in different sizes and that you can buy it in stainless steel.  However, one stone quickly fell off. I’m glad I bought it for myself and hadn’t bought it as a gift."
3.0,I got a size extra large and it fits me like a large.
3.0,"It fit a little more snug than I like and its a little on the thin side, but very comfortable."
3.0,This bra is slightly too big..while it is comfortable..the latches on the bra easily unhook while doing everyday things. They are not secure.
3.0,The brackets on straps are a cheaper plastic but overall cute!!!
3.0,Cute but really small!!!
3.0,Gloves are offer a solid level of heat retention for the price however I question the quality when less than a month in the spider-man esk web design is already peeling off the gloves. Makes me wonder about the overall product over time.
3.0,"Love the shirt, but the sleeves are too small.  Be prepared for that if you buy.  Had to stretch them out when I got the shirt out of the washer."
3.0,not very supportive. looks nice
3.0,"Super long skirt, even with heels but is comfortable and good quality"
3.0,"This product did not meet my expectations.  The fabric was thin and only one layer.  The ear holes were just that, holes cut in the fabric.  No loops so we could adjust.  I kept them but should have returned them."
3.0,Looked nice but were too wide.
3.0,I love it so freaking cute!
3.0,Served their purpose. Rhinestones made them cute-ish. They were the largest Fit Over Glasses I could find to fit over my larger framed glasses that weren't completely geeky looking (I say this as an admitted geek). The solid sides were hard to adjust to and I found I had to turn my head much more while driving due to the lack of peripheral vision.
3.0,"Pretty, but were much bigger than I expected, blue stone was a little cheaply looking...i have other Kendra Scott jewelry in other colors that look much nicer - for $50-60 I think could find same look of this specific colored stone at Claire's.  I love Kendra Scott jewelry in general for quality and style, just didn't care for this size or color, had to return"
3.0,Overall craftsmanship could have been a little better.
3.0,Item arrived in the said time-frame but the embroidery part started tearing in the corners.
3.0,"I have a small face so this being small is surprising. The seam digs into your nose and it falls down way too easily. I have to buy other modification items to make them functional. Even for an accessory, the person making these needs to work on the structure. the studs weigh it down which is why it is falling so much. Some padding for the nose would have helped make it more sturdy, and maybe a thicker ear band. Otherwise it is cute if I stay as still as a statue."
3.0,Good enough for a costume but far less impressive than leather
3.0,I would not recommend this shirt. Looks and feels super cheap. Also runs very small! I will be returning.
3.0,"I've looked for quite awhile for a lightweight scarf with penguins, so when I saw this one, I snapped it up. It has a few flaws in the fabric, but not noticeable enough to return."
3.0,These Legging are exactly what I was looking for! I purchased 2 pairs blue and red.. Unfortunately as soon as I opened the bag I noticed that the red pair waistband was not sewed together. Huge disappointment! The blue pair looks and fits great. So comfortable!
3.0,This would be flattering if the top was proportionate to the bottom. Weird fit.
3.0,"I found the earrings to be very large and over the top. Also, the clip that holds the post in your ear is visable from the front. Just not what I expected. They need to down sized and they would be great. Returns process was easy, always important when buying online."
3.0,Even though we use measured my wife's hand per the guidelines we are having to return them. The thumb is too small.  Having to exchange a large for an extra large.
3.0,"The shirt is a lot shorter than it looks, but is comfortable."
3.0,"Okay, it's made a little big, but I think they did that on purpose.  Still, it's really a nice beanie.  The little metal buttons fell off, but it still looks good."
3.0,"These underwear are very comfy. I rarely buy full back underwear because I can't stand pantie line, but these are pretty smooth. I thought I would receive 3 black pairs but instead I got purple, pink, and white. This may have been clear when ordering and I missed it."
3.0,"They came well packaged, but were tight above the ears. The frame wasn’t flattering for my round face, so I was going to give them to my hubby but once tried them he said they were uncomfortable around the ears. He did like though that it came with a little screw driver to tighten the frames. Unfortunately, we had return them, but maybe these would do well with other facial structures."
3.0,"Very pretty color and style, but in the solid color I think wrinkles presented an issue. 5'7 34D 135lbs and medium fit well. Sending this one back unfortunately."
3.0,"When buying this, I certainly expected something more functional. I am sure the RFID protection will be there... if actually using it will ever prove truly practical."
3.0,Still use them! They are good enough but not size wise. These companies really need to revise the one size fits all (or most) policy. I am constantly fighting with how large they are and them falling off. I have very small (and busy) hands.
3.0,"It pinches your skin, I stopped using it.  Looks cool though."
3.0,"Comfortable and a well shaped footbed, but too wide"
3.0,These socks fit a little larger than I was hoping for. Normally this wouldn't bother me much expect they don't look as nice when they are &#34;slouched.&#34; I was expecting them to &#34;slouch&#34; like the slouch socks of the 80's that I would wear with stretch pants.
3.0,"Product fits and looks like the picture. I wished it was a cotton dress, instead it is a staticy silk like material. I found it too clingy and it would probably be too hot in the summer. Definitely a fall dress!"
3.0,Not sized for human feet. Super narrow and overly long.
3.0,"It'll do for a temporary mask, measured in weeks."
3.0,"Nice and thick, which is good for winter. They are a little too slick so any hip hugging tops tend to slide up to the waist, which isn't ideal. They also snag easily. Overall I like them alright but not my go-to leggings."
3.0,"I will keep it for a beach day, but it’s too big for me to wear out as a summer dress. It makes me look much bigger than I am. Not super flattering. I ordered a medium, should have ordered a small."
3.0,Suit was nicely made however the torso was a tad long.
3.0,"After this has been in the washer twice, the words start to tear off easily."
3.0,"blah! the top is ok the bottom is kind of akward fit, too wide"
3.0,The Value for money is perfect! Most rings are comfortable too!
3.0,Cute enough just PJs.
3.0,"It's cute but it is wayy too long, and the pattern is blurry which wasn't a huge deal. Had to return because of length, not worth altering. I'm 5'3&#34; and ordered a small. I can't imagine this dress being short enough for anyone under 5'7&#34;"
3.0,A little small and the latch may not stay closed. However nice bag.
3.0,This costume was ordered for my 7 year old who wears a size 7 and this is way too big. Not very good quality either.
3.0,Material looks and feels cheap but for the price shouldn't haven't expected much more.
3.0,I loved this but had to return it because mykey fob did not fit. It was too small. I wanted to keep the rope part but  it was not an offer.
3.0,Turns your ears green first time u wear them
3.0,"Definitely doesn't fit like pictured.  Its much larger and roomy, If I didn't remove tags I would have returned.  Otherwise if that's what your looking for the shirt is nice material and nice style."
3.0,"Love the fabric pattern, hate the take draw string. Be warned!; Draw string does not go around the waist. It does absolutely nothing!"
3.0,"I ordered the &#34;light control full coverage lace girdle&#34;.  They are not girdles. They offer just a little more support than a regular nylon panty.  These are very nice quality panties.  The elastic around the legs are comfortable. The elastic around the waist is comfortable. It's a little wider than average. They don't ride up. They are very pretty.  The fabric of the panties is durable. The do come up to the natural waist. The 2XL fits a size 14/16 comfortably. The size chart is not accurate. The seller has the size equivalents listed in the question and answer section. That's accurate.<br /><br />I received panties in different colors than shown. I received bubblegum pink, soft purple, beige, black, white and navy.<br /><br />UPDATE: I lowered my rating on this panties.  Parts of the lace is substantial. The substantial lace is just held together literally by single threads. The threads tear apart very easily. That includes both the V panel and the lace around the leg openings.  That leaves a lot of holes in the lace. The threads that holds parts of the lace together is so weak, It is much weaker that the average spool thread.  It just breaks apart.  I am able to close up the holes with regular thread, but it does take away from the original beauty of the lace....and it's time consuming.  I don't recommend this style.<br /><br />Hand washing doesn't help.  I have only hand washed mine. The lace looks beautiful, but the quality is poor.  The rest the quality is great.<br /><br />I"
3.0,Took big on the shoulder
3.0,These undies fit well and are very cute but the colors faded very quickly and they look pretty old now after just a few washes
3.0,The cleaner was not what I expected.  I was disappointed. It didn’t clean my silver coins.
3.0,Adorable romper but unfortunately It shrunk after washing. I would suggest buying a size up.
3.0,I was going to use these to make custom products for my clients....however some of these had holes in them. Did not notice until I started cutting them for my crafts. The only good part is they came pretty fast.
3.0,It’s comfy
3.0,"I loved this purse when I received it, but the zipper broke within two or three days.  I liked the purse so much that I tried to make it work, but the purse kept breaking open and the zipper kept jamming.  I still think I'd buy La Cle again, as the purse looks and feels high quality.  It seemed like it could have been a fluke."
3.0,"My sons foot is wider, but nothing crazy- most sneakers fit. These weren’t a great fit for him. Super cute but not the best choice for him."
3.0,"I would wear it but, it is too thin for me."
3.0,The material is nice and the fit in the top is great but it's insanely short this is more of a top that you need to wear with pj pants
3.0,"My wife's review:<br />I would do less for star rating BUT it is a somewhat flattering swimming suit... here's why I gave it 3 stars:<br />1. The fabric seemed to be good quality compared to everything out there<br />2. I LOVED the thicker strap! It was comfortable on my shoulders and I didn't feel like I'd need to keep adjusting or pulling them back up.<br />3. The rouched fabric hid a bit of mom tummy bulge in the upper areas.<br />but here's why I sent it back:<br />1. I am only 5'0 tall, with saggy C, breast fed three kids boobs. Average to smaller torso length. It was WAY too tight in length. When I tried it on, after 10 seconds it was giving me uncomfortable pain in the side leg/hip creases.<br />2. If you have boobs at all, or even worse, some mom sag in your boobs, they will NOT stay in the cups. They fall down so you have double boobs. The seam cuts into your breast and literally you miraculously have two boobs on each side! Plus, the insertabke cup pads were a hilarious shape. I also had pointy boobs. Four, pointy, saggy boobs. Totally NOT what you want in a swimming suit 😂🤦🏼‍♀️<br />3. I wish the rouching would have gone down lower. Most moms who have a bit of baby belly and want to hide it with rouching, don't have problem areas in the upper torso, it's the lower stomach area. So if it had gone lower, it would have made much more sense 🤔<br />4. The sizing is WAY off. I sized UP because of other reviews and it was STILL a bit too tight for my liking.<br />Overall, the price is good but I don't think it matters on price....whether you paid $20 or $200, if it doesn't fit or isn't comfortable, you don't want to wear it!"
3.0,"Love the fit, stretchy material, light weight, super flattering on!! Just bummed it faded so much after 1 wash. I will now use as pjs. I got a medium"
3.0,This dress is comfortable and I loved the color and print of the dress. BUT the cinching/tuck part in front of the dress causes it to have a hole bigger than the size of a quarter right below my bra. It looks like it can be easily sewn shut but I returned it because it kind of looks like a pregnancy dress on me (it would be pretty as an actual pregnancy dress!) The fabric is not stretchy enough to breastfeed in case you were wondering. Hope this review helps someone.
3.0,Came damaged on deadpool logo
3.0,"dress is nice, but very small fitting. will have to be gifted."
3.0,"The dress is as pictured, but the fabric seems very thin. My daughter will wear a camisole under it"
3.0,They are OK. A little big for my taste. The double row made them heavy.
3.0,"This product is well made but did not fit my baby. She was 6 months old and chunky and the 6-12 month size was so tight on her that she couldn't wear it. Besides that, it is super cute but not for chunky babies."
3.0,Very stretchy but runs small.
3.0,General feeling of the seller did not write so good!
3.0,"Expect closer to a brown scarf, its not the pretty creme color like in the picture. The keyring is a solid metal band,wasnt even sure what it was when i saw it. Quality  of scarf was ok, but color isnt very nice. I dont expect  to ever wear it"
3.0,"Definitely happy with the actually product, but careful because it runs extremely small. I ordered 18-months thinking our son could grow into it because he’s currently wearing 12-months. This 18-month is smaller than our 12-month onesies. Now he’ll only be able to wear a few times between growing and washing."
3.0,"Cheaply made, not true to size.  But I made it work."
3.0,"I was under the impression that this was like a cover that you simply fit onto and around the brim of the cap.  That is not the case. It comes with Velcro that 1. Does not adhere tightly and snugly and 2.  It is smaller than the cap size, so make sure the background matches the color of your cap or else it will show"
3.0,It cute but it is too small for my 10 years old son. Very sad.
3.0,"Nice design but the measurements were off.  A little tight.  But for the price, kept it.  Might give it away."
3.0,"I like the size. I’m glad that it is not too big and it’s just the right amount of things. However as the pictures show, it came with the Reading hanging out of it and it should never come out the package and just like that. I don’t understand how that even passed basic quality control. Probably won’t order from this company again. But I do think the bag is cute and I’m glad that is vegan and cruelty free."
3.0,looks good but after wearing it several time they hurt they will need an insole because is really flat and uncomfortable.
3.0,Watch band a bit too stiff
3.0,I LIKE THE STYLE BUT IT IS TOO LONG AND THE FABRIC IS TOO THIN.
3.0,"The straps are super confusing and I feel like I spend 5 mins trying to figure out which strap goes where due to the cross straps it has to make it have a cross back.<br /><br />Other than that, it does seem to hold up pretty well after many washes and is super super supportive."
3.0,I don't think they're nickel free. I wore the gold pair for 6 hours and my earlobes are super swollen and irritated. I won't be wearing them again.
3.0,I recieved the wrong color. But they are still cute!
3.0,"The dress fits perfectly and the material is a nice quality.  However, the tie at the neck isn't long enough to tie in a bow , only a knot.  Makes it look messy and kind of weird."
3.0,"I’m comparing this to the hospital binder that is given after surgery and honestly the hospital binder wins.<br /><br />This black binder is not very stretchy so in terms of recovery post op, depending on what you’ve have done it could become very uncomfortable.<br /><br />The black binder material isn’t soft like a hospital binder.<br /><br />Also, the hospital binder in general has more material, a one size fits all situation where you can better adjust compression to your needs and tolerance. And of course the hospital binder is “free”."
3.0,Cute top but fit is definitely on the small side
3.0,I'm 5'4&#34; and 115 pounds and was drowning in it
3.0,"emstones Total carat weight 1.25 Genuine Garnet, 2 pc, Round Cut 4.00mm Genuine Garnet, 2 pc, Heart Cut 4.00mm vibrant color clean clarity Earrings pure sterling silver stamped .925 1.79 grams"
3.0,"Definitely summer/spring pants.  I normally wear size 4-6R, 8P, depending on the style of the pants.  I anticipated these being a bit baggy but they weren't.  They fit like a normal pant but I wanted a look more like the photo.  I returned them.  They were nice though.  The fit just wasn't what I wanted."
3.0,It is a little bit small for a man
3.0,Shorts are perfect for golf. Great cargo style with lots of pockets. However way too long. Had to have them shortened.
3.0,"decoration only., not a functional top at all. lol"
3.0,Its nice but I think it's expensive anyhow I asked for black but I received mirror
3.0,This was wayyyy too small and dingy. Not the best quality :(
3.0,These were smaller than I had thought and the latch not very secure.
3.0,"Runs small. This dress has no stretch to it. Beautiful colors, just order up a size."
3.0,wanted for a toddler almost adult sized
3.0,I got these for my five-year-old for days at the pool and she enjoys them. It took a little time for her to get used to how tight they were on her head but she has never worn goggles before. After seeing other kids and how they use them she got right on board with it and liked them. The straps adjust on the back pretty easily and I love the easy button release on the back. This kit also comes with a case a nose guard earplugs and an extra snap in the back in case the first one breaks.<br /><br />Update: after a few uses at the pool my daughter still enjoys them but I’m not as big of a fan. She has had a lot of trouble placing the goggle on her eyes correctly for the seal so she’s constantly getting water in them.
3.0,"Material is comfortable but very thin and could be cheap looking. You get what you pay for and overall ok with the purchase, but nothing special."
3.0,"So all knows when looking at the necklace on Amazon it would appear that it's shiny black & shiny silver (chrome). The necklace is mostly black<br />The parts you see thinking it's gonna be bright shiny is gonna be more like a dark black chrome look.<br />24"" (60mm) is a bit long for my taste, I contacted seller & all I was told is out of stock on 50mm which was upsetting.  Allnall seems to be a legit piece & should hold up for many years."
3.0,Runs small... was told that they were sending me another ( larger than what i purchased)  and they never did.
3.0,"I really liked this chain.  I had to add an extender because it is clearly for a tiny person but that wasn't a big problem.  I wanted the whale's tail because I had visited Costa Rica and stayed in Uvita where there is a beach called the Whale's Tail.  Unfortunately, this chain broke easily when it got caught on my clothes and could not be fixed.  i will find another chain to add the charm to."
3.0,"Cute dress extremely silky I can’t remember what it was made of but the feel of her silk polyester combo very slippery Feel. I don’t know if it was the wrong size I just it was not my style I was looking for something more conservative but I’m usually a V-neck or sweetheart neckline for a larger bust it just wasn’t cut right I probably would’ve kept it if I could’ve belted it myself instead of the sewn in Thai I’m short waisted but that tie came up under the bust line it just wasn’t cut for 5’5 lbs @ 194 it just didn’t sit on me right. Tie right under bustline. I am short waisted. However, An A line design would’ve fit me better straight from the bust w/o the elastic at bra line."
3.0,This fit in the torso but the leg holes didn’t seem to have the elastic needed to fit correctly. We wear with shorts over then.
3.0,"Very cute, just wish they would stay on. They slip right off."
3.0,"Very nice hat and I wish it had fit. Too small and is not in my opinion one that should be 1 size fits all. It is being returned.<br /> A FOLLOW UP ON THIS REVIEW. i did want to say the hats looked well made and in this case I feel that the mfg. was wrong in telling this seller that the one size fits all. I want to again say they are both beautiful, which is why I chose them in the first place..If your head is med to small they would probably be a good buy for you"
3.0,Didn't fit well and the color wasn't red
3.0,Disappointed with band. Extremely brittle for Ceramic. Be extremely careful when sizing as lugs in links break off easy. I will need to replace it with something more substantial.
3.0,"I am 165 pounds, a size 14 and ordered an XL. The dress is very flattering in the front, but not so much in the back, where it really shows off a bra bulge. I suppose I can put a cardigan over it to hide that.<br /><br />Its a soft material and appears finely threaded. A little too thin though, because you can perfectly make out my bra outline just like in the model picture."
3.0,The quality of the sweatshirt is great but it runs VERY large. I ordered a size Large for my son and it swallows him. I compared it to some of my husband's XXL sweaters and that seems to be the &#34;true&#34; size of the sweater.
3.0,More for a child then an adult. I have a round face (not very large) and these googles make my head seem large because the lens part is small
3.0,Nice shirt but me personally had to return it because the under arm space was too bid for me.
3.0,"My three pack of glasses are all comfortable to wear. The lenses are crisp and clear with no distortion. They include blue light blocking lenses, something I have to take their word for since I can’t verify it.<br /><br />What these glasses don’t have is spring hinges. Spring hinges make the glasses fit better and last longer. Not having spring hinges is not that big of a deal, unless the description states that they do have them but they don’t. I suggest that the seller updates their product description."
3.0,Its huge!
3.0,these are cute but they clank pretty loudly. and they are pretty heavy so they pull down in the front of my piercing hole.
3.0,Tight at the waist so I had to return it
3.0,"I have added a photo above which shows the sweatshirt in both sunlight and shade.<br /><br />The fleece seems thick and the sewing seems high-quality. No tags. Zipper seems fine.<br /><br />The buttons are on the left-hand side which is a typical for the American market, so be aware of that. The American flag seems to be embroidered well, however the colors used are white and navy blue. I was expecting at least black and military green or potentially gray.<br /><br />The green fleece itself is not military green but more of a pea soup green. That’s the biggest disappointment for me.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone else."
3.0,The sizes run small!
3.0,Runs Very SMALL! other than than the print is exactly as you see here and the quality goes with the price.
3.0,Nice top or mini dress.<br />Washed and dryed without shrinking.
3.0,After using it for a while it gets harder to open. You will end up ripping the button of the fabric eventually.
3.0,"I like the wallet BUT I have only had it for a little under 2 months and the handle broke...when receiving the wallet you must clip the handle on...no problem right, right...but today while grocery shopping the handle came off, when I tried to reclip it onto the wallet the clip broke in half (so just to reiterate it was only clipped twice; the first time and then this time).  It’s rather disappointing.  Otherwise the wallet seems nice, I like the bright color and you can fit quite a bit in it.  I’ll continue to use it but will miss having the handle."
3.0,"This bikini was cute but it's made by Shein, which I found out from the tag attached. That being said, I don't expect the piece to last very long, considering the track history of Shein's quality and the fast fashion industry. I would not have purchased this if I knew it was a Shein bikini. Oh well."
3.0,I guess i have slim legs because the socks are not any tighter in my calves than normal socks. It is tighter around my ankles which I guess will help a little. I was hoping for a tighter fit in the legs to help prevent varicose veins which I am prone to. Other than that they are cute socks.
3.0,They are too long. If you cut to fit in nose you loose them daily. These are not the same quality as what I purchased before
3.0,"Had to return this item because the zipper malfunctioned.<br />The item was replaced by Amazon, however the same problem happened again.<br />How can I get a refund?"
3.0,"The design is super cute, very soft and great colors.<br />However, the sweatshirt is on the small side and is also fairly thin. This won't keep most women warm in anything but 60 degree weather! And if you're looking something like that then this would be good but my wife typically goes for function over style!"
3.0,"Excellent service and quality. We were just looking for a compression fit that would help hold things in. These did not have that type of material at all. We’d also bought a size smaller. They were more like a wicking golf shirt material. If that’s what you need, it’s a great shirt."
3.0,"Zipper is backwards for a male.  Other than that, it's what I expected."
3.0,"Order the 4grey expecting the same color but it was significantly lighter grey. Overall love this hoodie since it’s long and comfy, but beware that you should definitely order a size up. Also….the hoodie strings are obnoxiously long. Other than that it’s a great lightweight hoodie to have around."
3.0,"The material when arrived  had some loose threading that I had to cut off.  When I tried it on though it looked good, I ordered a large (155lbs) and 5'9, I should have gone with the medium because it is a little loose around the chest and arms. It is a good dress to wear to a wedding though."
3.0,"It's cute, but the post is quite small, and the dolphin itself is smaller than i thought it would be."
3.0,I was disappointed this go round. The mask wasn't 100% cotton as the 1st set I purchased. It makes it hard to breath with the mask.
3.0,It barely covered my butt on the slit side.
3.0,"It was a little smaller than expected, but it was ok."
3.0,"Only problem was the composite toe that separated after a few months wear. If looking for an everyday work boot this is not it but an occasional wearer would find it comfortable.  Seller is great, boot craftsmanship is not."
3.0,The length didn't  seem to be right they were still to long. The fit over all seemed to be ok. Material seemed to be a little on the thin side.
3.0,"The posts were too small for my earrings. These need longer posts.  And this, consequently, made the earrings irritate my ears."
3.0,Ok for the price. Coating/anodizing seems to wear off very easily. Etching is smaller than it looks in the photos and isn't vertically centered on mine.
3.0,"My son loved these shirts but when he put the one on (to go cut grass) he showed me the rip in the material. He didn’t care since he was just going to cut the grass but feel the material is very cheap. He said they are great for working out. Feels good, likes the racer back better than other tanks. Just a little disappointed that one came flawed and can’t return due to him wearing two of the three already."
3.0,"These are smaller than they look in the picture, and the metal is really thin and bendable. They were bent when I took them out of the box. They are pretty, but cheaply made."
3.0,"This is sexy, but much more sheer and less fabric than shown. The panties are made for a child it seems. Wish the panties fit because the style is very sexy. The top is nice but would not worth more than $5 shipping included."
3.0,The ring is cute but stained my thumb green
3.0,Nice product but fits way too small. My wife is still losing the baby weight otherwise we would have sent it back.
3.0,"I am 5’4, 36 c, 170 lbs curvy blk woman. I ordered xl based on the reviews. I have a bit of bottom belly. The top was too big. My breasts were too small for the top so I have to figure how to take that in. The body part luckily has velcro so I can just add extra and overlap it. I feel I could have gone down a size or two. The panty part was made for children. If you have even the slightest rump this is going to be very revealing. just to get it to cover the crack the whole top of my v is out. I’ll have to make my own bottoms. The leggings do not go past my knee b/c of my thick thighs…not sure what I’m going to do about that…(will add photos later if it allows)"
3.0,I didn’t like the material at all
3.0,"the cheap metal left my fingers green, but the ring is quite adorable"
3.0,"True to measurements but less roomy than I expected. Slightly disappointed. It's alright for the price not sure that I would buy again though, just not what I was looking for. The tapered style makes the smaller top hard to get into."
3.0,"These pants didn't exactly fit like they do in the photo.  The poof out of the harem leg is quite small and you can't even really tell what the style is.  Perhaps it's because I'm on the taller side and the pant leg was stretched out straight, maybe on a shorter girl the extra fabric would have exhibited the poofy harem style.  I wasn't satisfied with it though.  Also, the material is very very thin and cheap."
3.0,Beautiful dress. But sadly the sleeves were made very small even for a size 12 dress. I am 170 curvey and the arms wouldn’t fit.
3.0,"We got these for our daughter and they are HUGE!  We didn't see the size listed anywhere and were surprised to find that they are as tall as her ears!  So only get these if you want really really big earrings.  That said, they're actually pretty lightweight and the tortoise shell (they call it leopard) design looks nice.  My daughter has actually worn them without any discomfort or issue.  Not bad, just big."
3.0,"Not to happy with it because the band was kinda blackish when it arrived and it looks like it has stains on the band. i really would like to return it, and just credit my account. the stone is very nice. but i would not buy it again, or suggest it for someone to buy it. Please give me instructions how to return this 925 Oxidized Sterling Silver Natural Black ring. Thank You."
3.0,Wanted them to be very low cut which it looked like in the photo but they weren't low cut enough. Edges were still showing out of flats.
3.0,Really bad quality and cutting. My boob can pop out anytime in this dress. Quality doesn’t worth the price.
3.0,The fabric isn’t what I was expecting. The buttons stick out a little aground chest area. Really read the reviews & size chart. Definitely go size up or two just to be sure. It is a cute dress though!
3.0,Color looks different than the pic.
3.0,Looks great I got lots of compliments but the wire above the nose broke after 4-5 washes.
3.0,Didn’t like the straps  Too thin and uncomfortable on the shoulders. I like the wider straps.
3.0,I was thinking this was like a regular pull over. Kinda like sweat shirt material. But it's really thin. My son maybe able to wear it in the fall but definitely not in the winter time. The material is really soft though. I would not have purchased it if I would have known how thin the material was. Anyone that has teenagers know they rather wear their hoodies instead of a jacket. I personally wasnt happy with the purchase.
3.0,Really soft but a little to big in toe areas.
3.0,It broke after a day
3.0,Was very upset with purchase. Dress fit great and is beautiful but it doesn’t look like dress in photo and slit in back exposes everything. Had to return
3.0,"He liked it, but it was very cheap feeling. For the price it was a good deal as a cheap gift."
3.0,didn’t come with a box. the bag was clearly scratched and flawed.
3.0,"The craftsmanship of the pendant is good.  But as you can see from the second picture, the gold is dull looking and not richly plated like it is in the amazon picture.  From far away it looks a little more yellow, but still, overall pretty disappointing.  The chain is also very cheap feeling and as you can see from the fourth picture, it has that frail kind of closing clasp that is easily broken.  Expect to pretty quickly not be using this chain and if you're putting the pendant on another chain and don't mind that the luster is on the duller side, you will still like this.  Otherwise i'd say pass.  I wanted to like this and love Eye of Ra jewelry.  But this looks as cheap as its price, which I guess is ok.  Thats why the rating is ""ok"""
3.0,"Color was a little off, looked very brown"
3.0,Not lined js.
3.0,The shirt didn't really have any compression and that is the reason I bought them. Will not buy again.
3.0,"color was not what I expected, but it was a gift and they like them."
3.0,"I bought the pants for my granddaughter,  they fit great except they are a little to short.She is 5'8"", the pants could be about 4"" longer."
3.0,"Im usually a size 8/10 in dresses and I got the size L and it fit fine. I liked it and liked the fit, but it was a little right around my booty and hips. Biggest complaint is that the sequin around the armpits dug into me really bad, and I couldn’t wear it for more than a couple minutes or else my skin would get irritated."
3.0,"I'm skinny and not the biggest guy, but this shirt has great sleeves, width is great but the length... Too short!!!"
3.0,"After looking at the descriptions and the comparisons in the thickness, I was hopeful these would be better than what I’ve been able to find in the every day store. However, the sickness doesn’t appear to me to be any different than what you find in the store. In my opinion it is too thin"
3.0,These are comfortable socks but difficult to wear for barre. The sticky spots don't go up quite high enough on the toes unfortunately. I have tiny feet so I think I just get unlucky with most socks being too big.
3.0,"Look at the size chart before you order.  You'll have to order larger than your normal size.  Personally I think this thing clings too much in the back, but I'm keeping it because it isn't terrible and doesn't accentuate my &#34;soft&#34; belly.  The little cleavage insert is a sufficient size, but the one on mine is crooked, so one side is higher than the other.  Not a huge deal for me, but might drive someone else crazy.  I ordered 2X and have a 43 inch bust, so I'm right at the measurement on the size.  I wish it had a little bit more room in it than it does, but, again, it works.  The apricot color is more ivory/beige, which is what I wanted.<br /><br />I actually paid for this item."
3.0,"Super cute socks, but very thin material. I can actually see my red toe nails through them. First wash the face on Gerald was ruined because of the seaming."
3.0,its a long. sleeve shirt black sabbath. not really life changing!!!!
3.0,Ok quality not what I expected
3.0,"Very cute but you definitely have to wear a tank or cami under it. A bit of an ""odd"" or awkward fit but I love the hearts."
3.0,"I wish there were more colors that's about it. I think they might be a little on the small size, but they stretch a little and they're not irritating to my feet. I guess that's good?"
3.0,"The dress itself is nice, however there was a major flaw for me – the bust area started way lower than the actual bust would be. Perhaps having large bust would compensate for a lower start line, but for me it did not work. I had to return it."
3.0,"They run small ,very pretty but small."
3.0,"I like the fit, but it sheds horribly!"
3.0,Bought for a fundraiser jewelry making thing for Relay for Life...doesn't glow like I thought it would.  Cute concept though.
3.0,My kids love these but after one wash they fell apart.
3.0,Calf hole way small also smell weird
3.0,"OK Bi Focal sunglasses, but one of the nose cushions came off pretty quickly :("
3.0,"I have large upper arms and the lines in the print and stretch fabric were not flattering. I really wanted to like this top.  I always wear 1X but the XXL size did not fit through the shoulders, arms or bust. Going back☹️"
3.0,I found these shoes to be smaller than other Umi shoes.  We are such a huge fan of them and were shocked that these fit differently than the rest of my daughters pairs of Umis.  They are very cute though.
3.0,"I had a hell of a time trying to figure out how to put it on, once on my tits kept popping out. Yeah it’s a cute shirt but it’s not practical"
3.0,This is not a true jelinda brand garment
3.0,The toe area is also Velcro and comes off easily.
3.0,Great quality runs about 4 times too small
3.0,This dress is really well made. And very cute. We ordered the 6-7. But the fit is sooooo off. We ordered the yellow one that would be Belle. The top part of it is loose. And the bottom is about knee length on my very average height almost seven year old.
3.0,prob returning an will lose miney therecwhich is annoying. its cute but size is awkward an strsps rvto short for shoulder so carryings awkward too. to small for beach but to big for purse. idk whst id do w it. bany bag maybe???  should b smaller....
3.0,"For the price, a good purchase."
3.0,"They are OK.  They serve their purpose.  Nothing special.  Not particularly attractive, but not terrible."
3.0,"nice but runs small, and the front is very low cut."
3.0,very thin material and is super stretchy but I got a large and wear typically 10/12 this shirt would fit a 4/6 correctly or maybe 8/10 tops if you want it snug very disappointed wanted to like it but just can't sizing is so off.
3.0,This material pills.
3.0,"Tag inside states Rayon, polyester, nylon and 20% cashmere. It would be nice to know where you can find 100% cashmere or mostly cashmere. Keeping them because they are good enough, help keep my hands warm, and I don't want to continue looking for something that doesn't seem to be offered on Amazon. I gave it 3 stars for ""Value for money""  because they were under $10. But, you can get a 6 pack of varied colors for almost the same cost, and they are more honest about what they are made from."
3.0,"A pretty good dress overall, but if you have any lumps in the back area, this dress highlights them."
3.0,Hardly any down. Very overpriced. More like a late spring jacket.
3.0,They did not come up over the ankle. I had read over ankle. I like the colors and the wear.
3.0,Didn't fit like they were described nor were very flattering which was a big bummer. Not the greatest quality in craftsmanship as well. Returned these and purchased a different pair from a brand in familiar with instead.
3.0,Runs a size or two small.  Order up!
3.0,it was ok straps were a little too long material was pretty good color was awesome
3.0,"I wanted to like this. But they are just so unflattering, awkward build, and seams. Material is ok, may get irritating after working out in. I especially don’t like the seam going across my bottom and down the crotch, not matter what I do to fix it, it won’t stop the unflattering looks."
3.0,The glasses hurt behind my ears.<br />They are well made with dark lenses. Presentation was very classy with a eyeglass case included. Even without my glasses on the sunglasses hurt behind my ears.
3.0,They didn’t fit my ray bans 🤬
3.0,"Great spin and a good size, but will dent and spin crooked if dropped."
3.0,"Nice pj's great quality. The pants however, are great in length but the top part is not much bigger than size 3. If your child still wears diapers, the pj bittoms won't fit for long. They need to make that part bigger too."
3.0,hard to breathe
3.0,My toes can't stay inside the sacks they keep on sleeping out from the heels. I wonder if there come with toes out. They probable be more secure.
3.0,"This is interesting.  I have purchased three of these hats, two fit tight and the 3rd one is way too small......for a child it might work."
3.0,"I'm barely 5 feet, 38G bra.  I now have a bit of a tummy, so I didn't like how the top blended my breast and belly together. Also, very thin, you can see through"
3.0,"I'm 6'0"" 240 lbs and this is a bit on the small side.  Don't know why they don't come in 2 sizes.  One as is for most women and children and one maybe 1 or 2 inches bigger for most men."
3.0,Very cute but not the best quality.  They bend very easy. Mine arrived bent
3.0,I loved this top when I saw it. I normally wear a large but decided to order an x-large to make sure it was big enough. The top is tight in tge arms. Very uncomfortable. Gave to cousin who wears a small. She lives it.
3.0,"Love the tank itselfgood fabric and nice feel but ordered an xl, which I wear, and it's too small."
3.0,"Fit me well and I like the color. The only problem is that there are bra pads in the top that can't be removed and they are super visible, even when the suit is dry. I mainly just use the bottoms and pair with a different top :/"
3.0,I ordered an extra large and they sent me a large. Had it been the right size I think it would have been perfect. I needed them so I didn't have time to send them back for the corrected size. I like them...just too small and not quite long enough on me.
3.0,The shirt runs very large… It's still very cute I like the fact that it has very fitted sleeves… And it somewhat bat winged ...  but it is very big... I do like it it's very soft and comfortable I'll definitely be wearing the shirt
3.0,The collars can become quitters. It’s hit n miss. Some collapse and some don’t.
3.0,hard to move size band. Looks nice but materials were cheap.
3.0,These offer no compression. They're just like stretchy shorts.
3.0,"It's very comfortable. But it's not flattering on me at all. Kinda boxy, doesn't do anything for my figure. Also seems to run a bit big. Maybe it would have been better if I'd gotten a large,<br />but I doubt it... just not a good cut. I'm keeping it because sending it back is too much of a hassle and it really is comfy, so I'll just wear it to bed."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress , however, I wish it were a bit smaller. If you're not pregnant as most women who purchase this dress appeared to be...you will certainly look pregnant. It compliments a belly very nicely. I am not pregnant, nor am I wanting to appear so. Therefore,  I was forced to return this dress. If I had the means and time to, I would've sought alterations."
3.0,These are very cute and comfy so my daughter says!  I bought them for myself but they run way small!  I am an xxlarge and ordered that and they fit my daughter who normally where’s a medium!
3.0,"These slippers are worth $3.99, not $13.99.<br />The fit is fine, but they are very lightweight. Think “dollar store” item."
3.0,too long for 5'5
3.0,They feel too tight and still slip off.
3.0,super tangly- even for one time use
3.0,Cute but too tight for my curvy and short daughter
3.0,"Worked great when I first got it, but after a couple months it slips off nearly the same as most other bands. I didn't wear it often, maybe couple times a week<br />No longer use."
3.0,"It said to order 1 size larger than your shoes. I wear a 10 1/2, so I ordered a 12. Could barely get it on my foot."
3.0,Look cute but def feel cheap.
3.0,"🤷‍♀️ Looks nothing like the picture, feels like paper. But I guess I need to wash it or something. I’ll update later because I had a dress from them before and I love it!!!"
3.0,"Overall it's cute,  but it came with no directions so was difficult to assemble"
3.0,"Got this backpack as a Christmas present for my husband who seems to go through gym bags quite frequently. This one is nice, its roomy enough and the materiel it's made of does seem durable. Still, I paid about $90 for the bag and I don't think it's awesome enough for the price."
3.0,"This is by far the worst talking watch ever.  If you pass 12am, you must wait until it resets to 12 again.....with the second hand running at about 1 min per 10sec.  Then, there is no way to manually lock onto the 60khz WWV(?) signal, and there is still no way to reset the time manually.  There  is no way to advance the minute or hour hand independently. The watch is suppose to reset at 3am.  We'll see. If it does, I will retract some of this review.  If there is no retraction on my part, it means it didn't lock on to the signal, and you should avoid this watch like the PLAGUE.<br />Addendum: Watch didn't reset at 3am.  It did however reset at Noon...after doing a complete factory reset (again).  It is an accurate watch (positive).  But for an elderly person, with poor eyesight, it will be impossible to maintain on their own....especially if they start pushing the wrong buttons.  I still think there are better options out of the box, but I have revised my 1-star to 3-stars to be fair."
3.0,"They are loose and comfortable. These will defiinitely crack up my grandkids on St. Patrick's Day!  They are fun, bright and silly."
3.0,Not a bad ring at all leaves a mark if you press it into something
3.0,Way to small and texture is rough.
3.0,Nice boots but too small
3.0,The ornament was great - apart from arriving broken.  The piece that sticks out on the back left was snapped off and was not even in the box to be glued on again.  As this was unopend and waiting  at my inlaws house for a year between holidays I was unable to return it for replacement.<br /><br />Because the ornament can be hung on the tree with either side showing I have turned it so the broken bit is hidden.  It's a shame because my Hubby loves it!
3.0,just a little heavey
3.0,"The last paragraph on their product page states that these  compression stockings can be returned or replaced---NOT TRUE.  I tried to return them and it stated they are not returnable.  Mine do not fit at the top of the stocking. Other then that, they seem to be well made.  They, also, state that they are easy to put on-- not true. It is very difficult to get them on over your foot because that area has the highest compression.  It takes  strength in your hands to finally get them up your leg.  My brother has arthritis in his hands and could not put them on."
3.0,scratched lens but not worth the time of returning Love them still
3.0,"Liked it enough to keep it, but very cheap looking vinyl.  For price I guess it's ok.  Use it alot as it holds all my stuff and very roomy and I wanted that color brown which is kinda hard to find on the web.  Like the long strap too."
3.0,"One thing I didn't catch when I purchased - it has a 1.5 - 2&#34; mesh (bigger than normal holed mesh) panel up both sides of the top. This runs from the base of the shirt up to where the bottom or your bust is. From the side, you can see the bra padding and skin. Not something I'd want for a teenager, so I returned."
3.0,"Very pretty but very small...I usually wear a large, bought an XL and ended up giving it to my step daughter that wears a medium"
3.0,Beautiful pendant but chain cheap and missing ring to attach clasp.
3.0,This is more like a Tee shirt! Not as happy as I wish I was.  Very disappointing
3.0,"I ordered this cardigan in green a few months ago and got lots of compliments on it, so I decided to order another, this time in what appears to be a dark shade of purple. It turns out that the color is closer to fuschia, which I'm really just not used to wearing and turns out it doesn't compliment me as well as dark purple does. Fits great, but be prepared for shade shock."
3.0,Delivery was fine but they are extremely hard to put on the frame . Maybe I'm just slow and can't figure out but the metal bands feel durable
3.0,These collapse under the weight of the dress.....dress is not too heavy.....I had to do some reinforcement with stay to keep the shape of the pannier......I can't recommend because of this.
3.0,Way small. I had to return. Looked like nice quality though.
3.0,Too blah for me.
3.0,"The dress is OK. Stretchy. Either I’m gaining weight or it’s a little smaller than expected. Color is misleading,  I bought purple, I got Fushia. I’m kind of disappointed bc I would really love the purple."
3.0,It ran small but very pretty
3.0,"I was looking for a new swimsuit to wear in our hot tub. I hate wearing the old lady style with skirts because they drip a lot after you get out of the tub and in the winter, that's really uncomfortable! I usually wear a size 18, so I ordered the 5XL. I used the size chart for the item and I took my measurements.  It fits and is wearable, but it's a little too long and gaps a little on the sides below the chest/torso area. I think a size down would have been better. Since I ordered this for use in our hot tub, not to be worn in public,  it will work well enough. There are cup liners/pads, but no support at all in the chest area. A smaller size might have offered a little more support just because it's a little tighter. There are two ties in the back - one around the neck and the other at the lower part of the bra area. The one around the neck was a little annoying because I had to tie it so tightly to support my chest.  The color is really bright. It's more of a neon pink. The construction of the suit is fine. And it arrived much earlier than estimated which is always a plus!<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own."
3.0,"The top ran a bit small, but otherwise it was good!"
3.0,"I can wear a large in most things and this was very tight, with very little stretch.  Cute overall, but no way someone with a 40 inch bust can wear the large.  Also, was not allowed to exchange, only return, and I had gotten it on sale so I won't be re-purchasing."
3.0,"It's ok, but could be a little longer."
3.0,"I was a little bit disappointed with this product, I thought they would have been of a heavier metal but than I am wearing everyday"
3.0,"I have purchased wigwam work sock,which fit perfect. For some reason these socks which are the same size do not stay up on my calf frustrating!! Otherwise warm socks."
3.0,It loosens very easily and you have to readjust several times during the day.
3.0,"This jacket truly is as lightweight as possible. It packs down to almost nothing. However. It wouldn’t advise it more more than a light mist in warmer weather. It does breathe through mesh panels but maybe too much for tons of wind. I haven’t really used it in harsh wind conditions so I can’t speak to that, so much as I can the rain. The arms of this really wetted out and it stuck to my skin like damp toilet paper.<br /><br />Being thin, it dried pretty quickly once out of the rain, but I just don’t think I’d take this traveling the way I’d intended. I might bring it to Hawaii, but not to Ireland or Portland, for example. If it’s cool out, you can’t afford gear that lets you get that wet."
3.0,It was okay. For the price it's what expected. The fabric is definitely different than the photo posted. But it is okay for a cheap dress
3.0,This was the perfect birthday gift for my little niece but when they arrived 2 of them were stain the packaging was intact with no damage but unfortunately she won’t be able to use two of them.
3.0,Loved it matched my luggage but a bit large for my needs
3.0,I like the purse except for the fact that it is smaller then they say it is.  The out side of the purse may be 10 in long but the big inside pocket is much smaller.  My phone and  kindle will fit so I will keep it.
3.0,BROKE after 3 month of use
3.0,this is wayyyy wayyyy wayyyy bigger than i expected/ wanted. i ordered a small but got an extra large
3.0,pre-teens enjoy this
3.0,Band is too big. I
3.0,"It's a nice anklet by the 'S' style clasp isn't sturdy enough. Keep a close eye on it, it'll try to slip away!"
3.0,Not lasting very long.
3.0,"It's an incredibly well constructed case and I really wanted to like it, but it is thick. I carry a card holder like this rather than a traditional wallet to reduce bulk so I returned mine. I'm hopeful that Red Wing releases a thinner version in the future."
3.0,"Purse arrived on time, however, one of the rhinestones on the clasp was missing. Since I was leaving for a wedding in Italy and needed the purse for this event, I did not have time to return it for an exchange.  Disappointed that it arrived damaged."
3.0,"Pretty color, light weight, three graduated sizes. I have not used them yet but the zippers seem to be a bit exposed and it is not expandable. Wheels r each single I hope they can hold up to rough treatment by baggage handlers. Very nice looking."
3.0,"I ordered a pink but got orange, was disappointed but not returning it incase someone else will want it."
3.0,Nice but runs small with little stretch. I ordered true to size per seller recommendation but I barely fit into the top and I cannot even get the panties around my hip to try on lol. I’m debating if I’ll exchange or just keep it until I drop a few pounds.
3.0,The material is costume like but not horrible. This dress is see-through in white and is a little longer than I expected.
3.0,Nice colour and comfortable. Material stretches out after washing.
3.0,"Bought shirt for my wife's birthday and she usually wears a medium, but this was too small and I have no idea how to exchange it for a new one."
3.0,It looks really cute on them  so I kept it after a 2 weeks started bending under their feet and second strip stipped off. Good for when you are sitting around or taking pictures not for climbing and playing and summer fun.
3.0,Duplicate order
3.0,It's getting 3 stars because of the price.  Loved it when i got it but after 3--4 washes the material is very ratty and uncomfortable.
3.0,"Very cute! Good price, but very itchy so my daughter wouldn't wear them."
3.0,"I ordered this and a shirt for my son, I didn’t receive my dress...I just received my daughters dress and my sons shirt...waiting to see why. Very upset about it.."
3.0,"The fit was good, just a tiny bit small. The quality at first glance looked great! But after wearing one of the tops for a couple of hours the lace at the bottom separated from the shirt. Very disappointed because these were exactly what I was looking for!"
3.0,Weird fit in the hand kinda. Touch screen is non existent. Keep hands pretty warm with construction. Definitely not no-30 temperature. Barley good in 30.
3.0,Ordered a 2x but fits like a large.  Unfortunately there are no larger sizes so I'll have to return it to get something else.
3.0,It's okay. ...a little cheap but u get what u pay for.  It does look nice though
3.0,"excellent ship time - arrived in one day. Bought for a friends milestone birthday - were a big hit. Drawback is that you can't see out of the glasses when the lights are flashing, so a little dangerous to wear and walk at the same time.  Very fun though."
3.0,"Beautiful dress! If you have a longer torso or slightly bigger chest than average, this will not fit properly. The skirt rides up too high. Disappointed it did not work out."
3.0,Sizes are def not true ordered a xlarge typically order large. But knowing they were going over clothes i ordered size up and these are more like a medium
3.0,They were super cute ….<br />But break easy … only thing that I still have are earrings.
3.0,Daughter like it.. but don't seem to be great material
3.0,"These were sized too small—we actually ordered a size up from usual and they were still tight. The fit was more like leggings than jeans—while we expected “skinny jeans” and a slimmer fit, these are men’s jeans and shouldn’t fit like cheap leggings for working out. We were a bit disappointed—my son wore them only once, and it was to a family function, never to school."
3.0,I didnt even have them for a week. They broke in half so easily. It was fun while it lasted.
3.0,"These earrings are quite large and I knew they would be, but the color is not what I was expecting.  The picture on the initial ad is very different from what showed up in the mail.  I was thinking it would be turquoise and I received a kelly green color that looks cheap.  The small glass pieces in the bottom are really rough and I expect they may fall out."
3.0,"I am 5'4"" 170LBS and carry my weight at my waist. This dress WAS NOT flattering to my body shape AT ALL. The fabric and quality were good."
3.0,"The opening is three if not four times as wide as it should be, you can feed multiple loops of strap through it…<br />."
3.0,"The loop is so small in which you to view that it is very hard to hold it at the right direction.  I would rather have a loupe that is at least 1 1/2' or 2&#34; in diameter.  The strength of the actual viewing glass is great, but it is so small, it doesn't work for me."
3.0,It just didnt sit evenly on my daughters head. The beal was to low so she couldnt even see. Shes 4 so the size was the correct size i bought. Just didnt work out
3.0,"The item is quite similar to what is described, has plenty of room.  I bought it for a two weeks trip to the Amazon and I was able to fit in there all the needed for such trip.  What I like the most was the lower compartment for easier access to stuff in the bottom and better organizing.  The color is really nice, it is good that it comes with the waterproof cover, but the disappointment came when after one week of use the fabric started to tear close to a seam.  Now it has a hole in the lower compartment and not sure if this can be fixed.  I'm giving it three stars for the color, the look and the space, but if you're planning to use it for jungle or more demanding activities, I would advise to reconsider other options."
3.0,"Although the material is fairly thin and is somewhat see through, I liked the styling, I liked the ribbed T-Shirt like fabric with the stretch and I liked the length of the top.  I normally wear a L/XL, but based on reviews I ordered the 3XL and I was not able to snap the bust areas closed."
3.0,"The shell fits somewhat snuggly, but the drapey front part is actually TOO drapey and adds extra visual weight"
3.0,"They're cheaply made. I like the designs of most of them, but I don't plan on wearing them often because of the quality. It reminds me of the cheap quality of the costume jewelry, that you'd buy just to wear on Halloween night. They seem disposable."
3.0,"I love the color and look however, I chose the ivory/cream color and it is see through. I have to wear a cami spandex in order to not show anything underneath. Overall, a good dress and if you ordered a darker color you probably wouldn't experience this issue."
3.0,"I got the multicolor coffee with the brown and blue print skirt.  The print is cute but the top is black not coffee (not obvious from the photo).  First, why would we want yet another black top?  (And I live in New York.. We wear a lot of black.)  Secondly, it was the brown blue combination that made it cute and different.  I bought a size medium and am returning it for a large, in another color combination."
3.0,Its little big
3.0,Some aren’t put together very well. I was able to use about half of these
3.0,"These extenders don't work for me, as the spacing between the hooks and the eyes don't match the ons on my bras.  However,the quality Iis good, so I will give them to a friend."
3.0,Nice. Put in back windows or they will fly away when you open a window
3.0,"Obviously used. The tags were half cut off, including the sewn tag on the back of the neck."
3.0,"Got this for my daughter, and the feel of the material is more for a tablecloth than for a dress (just my opinion of course). The size is a bit on the bulky side as well. It's OK if you are more on the heavy side, but it doesn't have much flair to it. Mostly a bit basic. I think it's OK, and might be enjoyed by some, and would look good on them too, but not on my girl."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter about 2 months ago and it keeps up but it’s not good for jam packing fullness. the zippers are faulty and trying to stuff the bag will cause them to break
3.0,Had to return due to a black mark on the top.  Otherwise it was a bit too large.
3.0,Fits smaller than indicated
3.0,"A little bit shorter than the band that came with my watch. Even though they're both 22mm quick release.<br />But my wrist is bigger, so if you have a smaller wrist then you're good"
3.0,purchased for my sons first birthday.  Ordered a 12 month and fits like my sons 9 month onsies. Shipping was faster than anticipated. Color looks a little different in person. Overall wirked for birthday pictures but I wish I would have sized up.
3.0,"I should have measured the length before purchasing. Definitely a little short for me to be wearing as a dress. Much more appropriate for someone in their teens & 20's. Plus no matter what I do, the skirt is always wrinkled. That drives me crazy. The sweater is very soft but the acrylic material makes me very itchy. The dress is really, really cute in the pictures and I love the layered look without the bulk but this is a case where I should have sent the item back. I missed the window by the time I realized."
3.0,Too big if you have tiny wrists!!
3.0,"I wanted this jacket.<br />It had everything I could possibly want- a nice colour, softshell, a hood, plenty of pockets, velcro positions and more.<br />Im a big guy. 6ft and pushing 300lbs. I can wear 2x but typically buy a 3xl so have some moving room and comfort.<br />I cant even zip this.<br />My shoulders are pushed in to the arms. If this is a 3xl I need a 5 or 6. Maybe the smaller sizes are ok but on the big and tall spectrum this falls way…well…short."
3.0,Arrived chipped
3.0,Extremely tight!
3.0,Not what I wanted.
3.0,They are alright. Came broken though.
3.0,This dress is very cute but the cut is just a little bit off at the neck which makes it look quite awkward. I needed a navy dress for an event and it held up fine after I first wore it but after consecutive wears it started to tear at the neck and arms. It also shrinks in the wash so it is significantly shorter now than when I bought it
3.0,The shirt is really nice but beware it is pink and purple also!
3.0,"I normally wear a 3x but I like tops and jammies to fit loosely so I ordered a 4X.  Well, I looked like an over-stuffed sausage in these. It fits like a small 2X.  They are very cute and medium soft but order 2 sizes larger than you think you need.<br />Other than the sizing they are pretty nice.  Sturdy looking material, well made, clean graphics. They have a lttle stretch but not much. Good value if you get the fit."
3.0,Very light sucks but I washed them once and 2 of them ended up with holes.
3.0,Bought these pants for work in the summertime since I work outside and get hot during the day. They're great for keeping me cool and fit as expected. They did however begin to rip in the crotch area pretty quick.
3.0,Not great quality and not nearly as long as the picture shows
3.0,I used the size chart and the dress still fit smaller then expected. Unfortunately my return window closed so I can’t exchange but it’s very cute. It’s also shorter than expected.
3.0,Cute but runs big!
3.0,"No instruction sheet included, bigger than expected, second hand hard to see."
3.0,Shirts are nice but just not true to size.
3.0,"Much thinner than expected, however still a decent neck piece."
3.0,"They look fantastic while wearing them, unfortunately mine also broke the flowery ring off while I was sleeping in them. The filigree portion is simply too thin to stand up to major use, but they are great for a special occasion or a night out!"
3.0,"These might work well if you have a small butt, but for me they are too tight and keep falling down at the waist, so even with a belt, they feel awkward and uncomfortable. The material is thick, so not good for hot temperatures. The texture is soft, which is nice and other than that I like the style, but the proportions just seem off for the sizing. I ordered the 2X, which normally fits me in other pants, but the waist is a little too large, legs are fine, and butt is too tight. I am 5'8, 240."
3.0,"This was cute. Only negatives were the material doesn't breath well, and the shoulders are too loose.cute otherwise."
3.0,"I still love the actual design of this shirt, but I want people to be aware of the sizes here...I ordered a medium (which is my correct size, sometimes I can even wear a small) in this shirt and it just arrived yesterday...I can't believe this is considered a medium in Ladies sizes.  Kids maybe, but not adults.  Seriously, folks?  It is reeeeeeeeeeally tiny.  So, just be aware of that when ordering.  Off to figure out how to exchange this..."
3.0,"I am a standard small in everything. This skirt runs extremely small. The waist has elastic, but the fabric itself has no stretch. It’s beautiful, but sizing purposes, I’m not happy."
3.0,The top was very cute and true to size. I'm 5'6 145lb 34b and got a large and It fit perfect. The only problem I had with it was that there was barely any of the pattern on the shirt. In the picture it shows having alot of the print on it..and while I don't expect them all to look the same because patterns vary..i did expect it to have more of the pattern on it then it did. It was mostly a black tank with very few flowers on it and in a weird placement. So just be aware that its most likely not going to look like the picture.
3.0,Not as stretchy as I'd like. One piece suits are difficult for us shapely women.
3.0,I think the size small would fit just right but the extra small that I received is too tight around the neck so I’m returning it.
3.0,The dress was a little too large so I had my seamstress tailor it to fit. The fabric is thinner than I like so I wear the dress with a jacket. Love the pattern.
3.0,I wish they came with the plastic backs as they fall out easily
3.0,"I love the look of the purse and the color. Love, material it is made from, too. The purse is deep, which I really don't have a problem with, and has no divider to make two separate sections. That would be preferable. The reason I gave it 3 stars. instead of 4 is because I have a long wallet and along with my checkbook it is difficult to get them in and out, especially in, of the purse since the opening is small and cannot expand. That with the purse being deep makes no sense and is annoying. Plus, try finding the zipper to close the purse easily. I usually don't bother closing my purses, but if someone does, that too is am inconvenience.  Now that I think of it, maybe I should have returned it. But no, it's nice looking and suffices."
3.0,The colors are not as pictured!
3.0,"I like these earrings because they are larger in size but very lightweight so they don't pull on my ear at all. I also like the flecks of silver that are in the snowflake to make them more sparkly.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because to me that is a passing grade but nothing extraordinary. If you look at my first picture, you can see that a piece is completely missing from the earring on the left at the bottom left hand side. It wasn't in the bag either and therefore I am left to assume that it broke before it was even packaged and shipped out which calls into question quality checks before products are shipped out.  There were also a few diamond pieces that hadn't been completely pushed out after being cut from the original source piece.<br /><br />So in summary, they are fun, inexpensive, and lightweight but the products are not inspected for quality before shipped out. Best of luck!"
3.0,Mine had a scratch showing the stainless steel bar had to return
3.0,This shirt was to small. Maybe it would have been ok if it would not have been so thin. I had to sadly return it.
3.0,Nice dress but runs small in size. The size chart is incorrect as to dress was still to small across chest.
3.0,"I used these at beach during winter to keep my feet warm. They are NOT waterproof, water will seep in through seams but I kept them anyway."
3.0,"First let me say these earrings are beautiful!! I love them. However, it came broken 😩 I don’t have the time to send them back! Plans to crazy glue them and hope and pray they don’t fall apart when I do wear them!"
3.0,Great fabric. Nice pockets. But size was too small
3.0,its too smallbut during the summer ill wear it to bed.
3.0,Not made for bigger people i wear size 20 because of my bottom half and could barely put on and the material is so thin. Absolutely no tummy control or even flattering. Fits snug into the rolls and cellulite. I can see these being good once I get smaller but I dont like my clothes super tight like this. Material was soft but too thin. Also got biggest size. So does not fit true to size cause I can normally wear 1x and 2x if its small and they have room still.
3.0,"In general shirt seems well made and warm. However, is way too small. Ordered a size bigger and could not even get it pulled down. Got it on a special deal so I passed it along to someone much smaller. They love it!"
3.0,Nice color...send me wrong size!!!<br />Big miss take!!!
3.0,Second pair of XL socks I've ordered. Socks were of unequal length in the pair I received. First pair was fine. Second pair was not the same length as the first pair that were also XL. Sizes are a little inconsistent.
3.0,I am 5'8 160 lbs and I ordered an XL.  Normally I wear a medium sometimes a large but can't get swimsuits to fit.  This one was no different.  The butt area was lopsided (one side wanted to ride up the other not so much) and the torso/crotch area fits short.  The bust area was too big for me ( I am a 32C).  So it just doesn't fit right at all.  I have trouble finding one pieces that fit my bottom half and top for some reason.  Didn't work for me.
3.0,"These shirts fit beautifully and very comfortable before washing. After washing with cold water and drying on light heat , beware... they shrunk up. At least I can still wear the two I ordered but they aren’t as comfortable and as long as I preferred. IF, I order again I would go to a large but I never wear a large. I am 5’ 125 pounds and small chested so I definitely do not warrant a bigger size.  So, yes, this shirt fit as expected, but only before washing and drying. I won’t order again.😞"
3.0,well if you want everyone to see you in all your glory and what's under your pants this is for you.
3.0,Fit way too big and material is a little stiff. I guess I was expecting that but was hoping to be surprised.
3.0,"Over sized, baggy.<br />I do not like the fabric.<br />Although the shirt is cute and made well."
3.0,"They appear to be of good quality for the price and I think they will hold up.  The do look like the picture so THAT I CAN'T DENY.  However, I don't think the yellow/gold color is bold enough and it is sort of washed out in my opinion.  I wish the color was more bold to stand out more.  Otherwise, I am ok with my purchase!"
3.0,"This is definitely lovely but, it came with one of the stones missing. Ah well, I still like it!"
3.0,Gold wore off after only a couple weeks which disappointed me.  Lays nice and is  very comfortable to wear tho.
3.0,"My husband said they feel good once he gets them on, however, they are definitely not easy on/easy off.  It took him at least 15 minutes to get them on.  If you are weak or you are buying for someone that is weak, this is probably not the compression sock to buy."
3.0,Nice necklace but the map is barely visible due to the color combination.
3.0,Matserial seem low quality. But you get what you pay for. Good for temporary use and to have around for personal use.
3.0,The dress is shorter than I expected. It is a sheer dress.
3.0,"The pants fit perfectly. They arrived within two days and I love this brand and will buy again. However, I ordered the color &#34;Magenta Space Dye&#34; and the color was nothing like it was in the picture. I also order them in black, and obviously there would be no problem in color there."
3.0,Pink
3.0,"Slid down and act like a tourniquet on your ankle, meh."
3.0,Update to review.  After I wrote a bad review the company contacted me and sent me a new wallet.  I have used it for about a week and it is ok now.  It is good if you dont have alot of items in your wallet.  However with the phone and my checkbook it doesnt work out because it puts stress on the zipper.  However I love the color and the leather!!<br />---<br />Broke after 1 week of use.  The zipper is low quality
3.0,"Queda muy justo y como que se baja<br />Talvez es por la tela, es caliente pero no me gusto que tenía que andarme lo subiendo"
3.0,I’m usually an XS and the S was definitely very big on me. It’s a cute design.
3.0,Easy wear sandals for my three year old. He never complained about the fit. My only negative criticism is that we have had these for about 3 months and the stitching on the Velcro straps is already pulling apart in a few areas. He is not tough on his shoes.<br />Cute and functional for the price.
3.0,Got this for my little sister as a gift. The trainer belt is built well; it's sturdy and comfortable. But it's too short. When my sister puts it on it covers the lower part of her abdomen but not the upper part so a fat bulge forms at the top of her abd and it's very unflattering. In general we like the belt but it's not wide enough to cover the entire abd.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,"very cute style.  the fabric is really cheap and kind of stiff and the quality of the sewing is not great, but for the price, it's OK.  the style is really cute, so I'm just going to give it a good pressing and wear it!"
3.0,"Pretty color, flows nicely. Too tight in the hips for me."
3.0,It’s thinner than I thought it would be. But overall it keeps him covered when going to the bathroom.
3.0,It is a nice product but sizing is way off.  Bought for a 16y old ended up fitting a 10y old.  Kept it.  Size up several times if you don’t have a back up person who can fit into
3.0,They eyes are very off. And kinda looks scary but the necklace it’s self is fine. Pretty long.
3.0,"This long sleeved t-shirt is soft and I ordered in a beautiful green. I did not notice  when I ordered it that there are extra straps interwoven into the shirt - not a good look, and this is on me, for not noticing this.<br /><br />I ordered the size according to my measurements and it was too big, arms to long and made me look like a frumpy old woman. Not a fan."
3.0,Warm and cozy. But the other reviews are right-- it can make your belly area look weird.. Even if your super slim.
3.0,Es mucho más grande de lo que pensé. Para mi gusto no.
3.0,First off the advertisement pic is misleading: u think you’re getting 3 masks but you’re getting one and a bandana. So you’re basically paying $9 for 1 mask (what are u going to do with the bandana?). The fabric is thin but it does have a convenient filter pocket. The ear straps are easily adjustable. The metal nose piece is really thin and didn’t really hold the mask in place for my son. It was a tad big and my son has a very round face. He said is was comfortable but to me it didn’t look like it stayed in place very well. It is a cute pattern but not worth it. Overall just a meh mask. Spend your money on better quality masks.
3.0,"They are nice riding pants, however, they don't fit as nicely as the boot cut.  They are tighter and the waist band feels a little different.  I was a little disappointed."
3.0,More in the black/ivory mottled look than I was expecting. Posts are crooked. Definitely not my favorite. I can wear them but not what I expected
3.0,"Mask looked and felt fine, but it was so big it covered most of my face. How big do they think people’s faces ARE?! I have a long, narrow face, and had to get a child/teen size. SO, BUY SMALLER THAN YOU'LL NEED. Also unhappy with how long it’s been taking to get my packages!!"
3.0,I wanted to help the women. I also liked there bracelets. There a little bit to tight. Wish they were a little bigger. They are beautiful well made just small.
3.0,"Six layers, but hard to wear for an hour.  Rest of family do not like."
3.0,I bought this dress in white but decided I wanted a different color
3.0,"Overall, it's not that bad of a sweater. The material is really thick and is very soft. However, the sleeves are really long so I have to keep it folded up. And the color somewhat washes out with the first wash."
3.0,These socks are huge! They're bigger than the 4/5 boys socks I bought at the same time.
3.0,my bad for not reading entire size.. beware. nice little thing but not what I needed
3.0,When this came first I was suprised by the material. It felt silky almost more like a dri-fit material and I was expecting cotton feeling. I didn't mind the feeling and think it would have been quite comfortable. The product did run small I ordered a large and I am 5'10&#34; and 157 and the shorts were a bit snug on me. What I did not like about the set is the top. It was extremely boxy and short on me. I am tall but I have a short torso and the top barely hit my hip bones and would hike up super far if I raised my hands. I will be returned due to the fit of the top.
3.0,They are very pretty but they are super hard to open!
3.0,Pretty dress that fits well in the chest and waist.  But it is way too long in length.  I would have had to have it drastically shortened to wear it.  I chose to return it.
3.0,They are ok.. just buy a size bigger unless you want it real real fitted.
3.0,"Beautiful Dress BUT it literally fell apart by the end of the day. First of all I had to order a tan maxi to go under...couldn't wear it otherwise because it is extremely sheer! Second: The part of the dress right under the bust is kind of awkward where it ties...I feel like there should be another button because the elastic is so strong, it pulls too much and gaps open. The back shredded by the end of the day...can't fix it because the dress is so sheer."
3.0,"About what you would expect.  My TARDIS necklace had a dent in the side, but it's fine.  Cute necklace when dent-free."
3.0,"bought 2 of these, a silver and black for my husband and the black and blue for me. mine is holding up well, my husband's is not. 3 of the black plastic chips have fallen out and he doesn't know where. my blue and black seems to be fairing much better. we both wear them all the time and work in similar jobs, a little bummed by the apparent quality of his bracelet."
3.0,Love the dress. Except whoever made it sewed the slip on inside out which makes the  seam show throug the dress.  I have no idea how im going to wear it for my Bridal Shower Saturday. A little dissapointed.
3.0,I was complimented for this top...its cutest of my all Allegra buy...Its not white but beige color..I recommend this top
3.0,"I loved the wonderful smooth vintage leather (SMVL), but I disliked the buckle detail that extenuates the width of my calves. Even though I got these at a steep discount, I'm returning them and keeping my eyes open for a different Frye style."
3.0,the gold grommets are so ugly. I am banking on them to tarnish and look dark silver or something.
3.0,Material is cheap but you get what you pay for
3.0,They are nice and soft enough and they stretch just enough to fit my larger calves over my leggings. I don’t think they will fit over my jeans though. (I will try that later).  But I give them only 3 stars because the color of the “purple” leg warmer is not the same as the picture. I was expecting purple and the color is more on the maroon side. Still they are cute.
3.0,A few weeks later it turned silver.
3.0,"It's much thinner than expected and the size charts are way off. Measurements said I need a large, but it is at least 1.5 sizes too big. A med would be loose or a small would fit snug."
3.0,Is nice but look very low quality
3.0,I have to tie the straps so that it will fit a little better
3.0,I like the color and not the quality.  They look cheap.
3.0,This dress has the feel of a flanel shirt.  Not what i was expecting.  Collar looks larger on my daughter than on the model.
3.0,I really like this at first but I barely use this bag and the string is already coming unraveled.
3.0,"Sticks to my skin and makes me feel sweaty all day, every day. Yuck. Doesn’t matter how loose I wear the band.<br />Purchased because I don’t like the color that came with my Samsung Galaxy watch 4.<br />I do like that these bands are thinner, with multiple colors. They fit and are functional. But man, they’re so uncomfortable!<br />The original white Samsung band is a different material and feels much more comfortable."
3.0,I love it until the Buddha charm kept falling off even after tightening the link.
3.0,It’s a nice bracelet but it’s thin and I’m afraid my daughter with break it within the first wear.
3.0,"The ""real Leather"" is extremely stiff but the band is cute. No actual problems w/it, just a comfort thing."
3.0,like the color very pretty dress
3.0,"Inexpensive, looks nice, sized right for small wrists. Braiding does not look real up close, not sure if leather is going to hold up long. For the price, still a good deal. Wear with clasp out so steel does not get scratched on desks etc"
3.0,Seam wasn't sewn properly and there's a hole in the top. Otherwise cute for the price. No time to return.
3.0,I'm 5'5 between 145-155 and I thought the dress may have run small so I ordered a large and it was extremely big!!! I reordered a small and it was still slightly big and a xs is not an option so I had to get it tailored. Overall the dress is comfortable and I received so many compliments!!!
3.0,"I wasn't exactly expecting this dress to be wedding quality, let me make that very clear.<br /><br />My daughter has been wanting to do a Corpse Bride cosplay for a while and I thought it could possibly work for her to use for her cosplay.<br /><br />Unfortunately , it didn't fit  as intended, and even still doesn't exactly have the desired look and effect.<br /><br />It's great if you want to use it for a quick shoot, or a ruin the dress concept, but I wouldn't exactly bet on this for an actual wedding or prom look.<br /><br /> I will say for the price it is not a bad dress ..<br /><br />The  material isn't the best and the inner slip kind of rides up in a weird way , which makes it feel like it's not fitting properly.<br /><br />I would suggest ordering a size slightly larger than your normal, and if you have to get it altered,<br /> it's better than it being too small!<br /><br />The company includes a specific dust cover/garment bag ,<br />which I think is a nice detail that was unexpected, especially in the price range."
3.0,Very disappointed. Got out to wear this year and a stone was missing. Love them but looks like I am not the only one this happened to.  So the quality control is not good. Would buy new ones but at $40 a little steep plus might happen again.
3.0,Numerals too small
3.0,"I ordered 5 different styles in small. I don’t think they are worth 17 dollars each but more like 10 dollars maximum. They are lightweight which I like and will need to be hand washed and air dried to keep them in good shape. The fabric, stitching aren’t of the best quality I would say a bit less than F21 and the shirts run very small. Luckily they have some stretch so if you like a tight fit order your regular size or of you like a less tight and more comfy feel then order a size up. Otherwise they are cute tops but will most likely not last very long due to the quality and craftsmanship."
3.0,"I was very disappointed in that the stitching came out after only a month. My friend said that they were comfortable, BUT there was no reason for the stitching to come out so soon."
3.0,"I had to return the small as they were too big in the waist, and I do not have a small waist.  34&#34;- 28&#34;- 34&#34;  Otherwise the quality appears to be good."
3.0,"I continue to search for a durable everyday shirt for a retiree. I'm actually looking for a replacement for the oxford cloth dress shirts I used to order from a famous company in Maine. I could get off-the-shelf  shirts in the neck, chest and sleeve sizes to fit me comfortably. But times have changed, and those shirts are now expensive, with fabric that is not very rip resistant. Right off, the Red Kap shirt in ""large"" is too tight around the neck and chest, and the sleeves are about two inches too long. Nor are they wrinkle free as advertised, and no one in this house does ironing anymore. Bottom line: OK as a work shirt if I move the sleeve buttons over a bit to hold the cuffs above my knuckles, but not perfect for my body shape. If they work for you, the price is right."
3.0,The material is cheap.walmart is better but for the price it's worth it if your on a Budget
3.0,Fit was too tight. Definitely does not fit loosely like the picture looks.
3.0,Meh.  Quality was ok.
3.0,"The boots were sparkly,Hoever the heel is brown n black not black as shown in the picture.  The toe is a snip toe not round as it discribed."
3.0,In my case the medium was a bit too snug.  I usually wear in between a med. and a large. Something to consider if ordering.  BUT I also bought a medium in the gray color and they fit great.
3.0,cute shirt but runs small
3.0,Order up the size runs very small
3.0,"Size, price, and weight are good. Not the best for communicating with people while wearing it. I catch myself having to pull the mask down so that people can understand what I'm saying."
3.0,"Pretty color, but fit is very strange.  Runs pretty small up top.  Very short."
3.0,Kinda big and baggy. Wishing I would have ordered a medium instead. Also the black lettering on the dark gray T-shirt isn’t obvious at all. This is why I hate buying clothes on amazon.
3.0,"Loved the cuff links, but the top came off ..appears it<br />Wasn't welded or glued properly...now stuck with one broken cufflin..:("
3.0,Pants run a little big
3.0,I liked the style but there is no way that its size matched  I ordered a size bigger and is still way too small
3.0,"Loved the rattan look- nice and light, modern size but the gold disc thats part of the post looked cheap & gaudy to me. I actually removed that and added a brown wooden bead. But that was easy for me because I also make jewelry. If I didn't have that resource I would've returned them"
3.0,"Pretty basic white shirt, a bit see through but good for layering."
3.0,"This band is slim and comfortable to wear. It matches my Apple Watch very well. It does not snag my clothing like my last mesh band did. I also love that the mesh is not folding over at the joint between watch and band like the magnetic ones do, however, this clasp is fiddly to close. It’s difficult to put on by myself, and I have had it come undone while wearing it. I give it 3 stars for the clasp issues, if these were corrected, it would be a 5 star band!"
3.0,"What I expected for the price. It's really a cute styl, fits well, I haven't worn it yet, the cups look like they mitt &#34;flote&#34;, and the skirt edge is not hemed, but for the price i would recommend."
3.0,didn't stay on my boyfriends feet very well.
3.0,Great product just thought the sizing seemed a little small
3.0,"I love it, but it flips over and doesn't stay in place,"
3.0,"For the price, the earrings are okay.  The posts came bent, but I was able t bend them back into place.  The skeletal hands are much larger than I thought they would be."
3.0,I did not receive the High Low Tunic as shown in the picture - it was a tight fitted top with loose arms.  I did not want the hassle of trying to return it so I kept the top.
3.0,"I ordered xxl, but it was too small.  I typically wear a 14-16 in dresses, xl in tops, 12-14 in pants. I’m very curvy and that’s mostly why the dress didn’t fit I wear about a 36G bra size and this dress is made for a much smaller chest even in the xxl size. The material is stretchy, so my arms fit fine, but having broader shoulders and a larger chest caused gapping in the armpit area, smashed my breasts, and empire waistband came across my breasts rather than under. The fabric is stretchy and has a slight shine to it like bathing suit/leotard material which I did not expect."
3.0,"2 pair fit good, 2 pair a bit tight, 1 pair definitely way too small"
3.0,"I thought these would be a roomier.  I don't like really clingy clothes and these are skin tight.  I think that is what they are supposed to be, however, not for me."
3.0,Didn't come with any instructions on how to set but my son loved the look of it. Still not showing accurate time
3.0,"The hat was perfect, except when it was shipped, it got squished, and the band around the hat was not intact. Actually, i dont believe the band was intact initially to begin with... Maybe have something inside the hat to keep its shape while shipping? Otherwise, i love it. I can glue the band down to the hat myself."
3.0,"The dress was very cheap made, looks like  Halloween costume , pay $34 was not worth, and also was too short , the back split part of the dress will showing your butt"
3.0,I love them but I would only take them on vacation to a colder climate not great for where I’m from it’s too hot here
3.0,So long!!! Looks more like a robe than anything.
3.0,Bow tie is not  as neon as photos indicate.
3.0,"These are really cute, but when you wear it, it keeps flipping over so it always looks backwards"
3.0,This t-shirt shrunk terribly.
3.0,Didn’t fit my watch as I hoped it. Fell off holder and scratched front guard. I used packing to make fit better.<br />One can’t adjust band to fit machine!
3.0,"Pouch was nice but with passport and papers, it was too heavy for the thin straps. Lasted 2 weeks."
3.0,The biggest issue to me is that it has way to big of a neck hole.  I like my neck collar snug.  I also could go for smaller arm sleeves too.  Comfort and fabric is ok. If these were anything more than a work shirt I'd return it
3.0,i ordered according to their size chart and ordered a large and they were way to big. the other downside to these is the waist rolls down on them constantly.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but I didn't love that it was slightly see-through, like another review mentioned. I would've needed to wear a slip of some sort underneath it, so I returned it. I bought the black, size small."
3.0,The Top Pocket Zipper will eventually break from the inside Seam. The Middle Front Pocket is useless because you can not access any of the internal Pockets. I put Velcro in order to make use of the space.
3.0,"Okay, my son needs shirts.  This is on the thin side.  It will not last long."
3.0,"It's marketed as fitting ""true to size"" but actually runs small. The material is very thin, so you can easily see through it.  Love the length,  colors and style. Just disappointed in the fit and quality."
3.0,"cheaply made, doesn't hang well"
3.0,"Nice material, however the arm size was tight. Not sure how many wears I will get out of it because of arm size"
3.0,Cute tutu but it didn’t come with the handband
3.0,"I bought a skirt it was one size fits ,it fits but not contable it’s to tied in waist , but is ok cuz 👍🏻"
3.0,My mother don’t like because of something about Watering system. I’m not sure what the issue.
3.0,Watch band fits like the original. Only complaint is about the included screw/tirx driver. The head stripped while screwing in screw 2 of 4... would have been in trouble if I didn’t already have a quality Torx driver in the right size.
3.0,The onsie is small. And looks like they forgot to sow a button.
3.0,"The only thing I liked about these sandals were the colors; I got the green and blue. Super adorable in that respect. The fit was not great. As I walked, my foot kept sliding backwards and my heel stuck out about an inch. My fiance said it didn't look bad, but I sure did feel uncomfortable. The width of the sandal was perfect though, and I have pretty wide feet. Def returning them and getting Sandalup instead."
3.0,"I was not really pleased with the clasp. The lug width is a tight 20mm, and when attached to the watch, it looks decent enough, but it’s kinda cheap looking  and feeling.<br /><br />Also, any attached band doesn’t look as nifty as a band which is built for this type of deployment clasp.<br /><br />Overall, it was a nice idea, but it’s better to just buy a band built with this deployment already. It’s a poor aftermarket substitute, but it got the job done."
3.0,"Very tight and short, xl fit my size 5 daughter..."
3.0,Runs small. Not for an extra large waiste
3.0,little cheap made
3.0,"It’s probably my fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions, but this bag is huge. It’s also very stiff. I do love the wallet and use that every day."
3.0,Love the design but they are too big.
3.0,This is a pretty tee shirt and fits well enough what have you; but the design is just stamped on and has begun to flake off after one wash/wear so that's greatly disappointing.
3.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they just made my size 8 feet look like clown feet bc the shape made them very elongated. I’m 5’3” and I just thought I looked ridiculous.  Super comfy though and I loved the material bc they could easily be washed or wiped clean."
3.0,It was kinda loose by the hips
3.0,"It's a good dress for the price. It fits well. It's NOT 100% cotton. 75% cotton, 20% spandex and 5% poly. I decided to keep it but I'm not overly excited about this dress probably because of the quality and material,"
3.0,I have used Stone Mountain bags in the past but this one wasn't quite up to the standards. I love the style and the many separated sections and places to put stuff.  I do not like a hobo type bag.  One of the zipper pulls came off in August so that is a bit annoying since it should be made better than that.  The feel of the leather is of a lesser quality.  Love the style but wish it had the durability of the older Stone Mountain bags.
3.0,"I like the clicker more than the horseshoe ring. The horseshoe was bigger than I expected it to be, which was disappointing. I love the look of the clicker, but it was hard to remove."
3.0,Such a cute top but way to small.  Gifted to a friend who is much smaller and she loves it!
3.0,I am petite it slides off. Its huge!! Beautiful though..
3.0,Material is soft but it’s short. Just goes to waistline.
3.0,The fabric looks much cheaper than the one pictured.
3.0,"They are what I figured they would be and therefore . . . just fine.<br />For bifocal sunglasses that I can wear driving and working in the yard. . .  and not be worried about them . .  they're perfect.  I refuse to pay ""big dollars"" for a pair of ""big name"" sunglasses!!"
3.0,"These boot cuffs are fine quality wise, but I was very, very disappointed in the color. I have matching mittens, hat, and scarf; they matched the color of all of the pictures posted. When they arrived, they were extremely dark maroon, not the vibrant dark red, as pictured."
3.0,"I ordered size 4T but it is huge. I like the quality, but it is not suitable as girls undershirt because it is too big."
3.0,"Good earrings overall, design and comfort-wise. But two had the bar attached to the other segment instead of the base, making insertion les comfortable."
3.0,Ran small for my waist. Returned. Good material and stylish though.
3.0,"Very nice shirt but it is very rough, not soft."
3.0,I like this shirt. The fringe is adorable. The only thing is that the shirt is actually a t-shirt with the fringe sewn on. But it’s still cute.
3.0,"I really like the look of this case, however, when I received it it was way too large to fit in my purse.  I returned it.  I'm not saying there was anything wrong with the construction, or the materials.  It just was too large for my purposes."
3.0,The pants were covered in little bits if thread when I took them out of the package. The stitching looks as if its about to fall apart. They make my butt look weird.
3.0,"I wish I had realized that the pocket is really more of a pouch on the front of the shirt.  It's awkward to carry supplies, pens, or anything really."
3.0,Great product but not for a female with small build!
3.0,10 pair found so far that do not work. Purchased for 5th grade science and 19 pair found so far that have no prisms on the film.
3.0,It is not fleece lined at all but it is comfy
3.0,"I am a plus size woman and it fits. If someone is chasing me, I might fall since its snug around the legs area but it fits."
3.0,Every big over the neck
3.0,"The dress is pretty but it was more off white than white. I need pure white.  Plus the slip was too short for me.  Many people prefer them that way, but that doesn't work for me."
3.0,My half glasses for reading work better.
3.0,"It is too large, about 1/2 to and 1"" too long...does not fit in pocket or jacket.  Otherwise a great wallet. Made in China."
3.0,I loved the shape and the fabric and the design of the shirts. I Purchased three. Unfortunately they run a little too big and I wish I had ordered the size below.
3.0,"I really wanted to like these. However, the pants are too long on me (I’m 5ft 4 in) and so they end up looking like scrubs! If they came above my ankle it might have worked. They end up just looking baggy and sad."
3.0,"Slippers very cute - good quality, but these run very small. I wear a 7-8 shoe size normally and ordered a large; I could have worn the slipper, but not comfortably - and who doesn't want to be comfortable in slippers? Good buy, but choose a size (or two) larger than you would normally order."
3.0,"Came as pictured, I ordered pack mainly for the black and gold rings, I already have a silver ring. Gold ring came broken, will not clasp. The other 2 are fine."
3.0,"Ok - so I bought this dress in two colors and two sizes. I am 5', 138lbs, small/medium chest. I usually wear a medium or small in tops, and a medium in most dresses.<br /><br />1) Navy-green, size Medium<br />The sleeves are tiny. I have generous upper arms, but there is literally no give in the fabric and it is cut small. I couldn't fasten the keyhole in the back because I couldn't lift my arms, and my husband had to help me shimmy out of the dress because I couldn't bend down and reach for the hem (not my finest moment). YET even though the arms are tiny, the shoulders are huge with a sad, strange little puffed up thing happening. The body of the dress is tremendous: I have a smallish chest and a bit of a belly and I was just swimming in it. A belt didn't help, because there was so much fabric that it bunched up in terribly unflattering ways. The color of the dress is exactly as pictured, as are the flowers, but the print looks cheaper in real life. I'm returning this one.<br /><br />2) Black Red, size Large<br />The sleeves fit! The dress definitely rides up a little when I lift my arms, but I was able to remove myself from this one without assistance. There is no keyhole in the back (great, less details to worry about). The body of this dress was more proportionate to the arm size, though still larger than I would prefer (def flowy and not just &#34;skimming the body&#34;). At my height of 5' this fell right around my knees, and shorter when belted. The color is NOT BLACK: it is navy, which is how it looks in the picture, but it's beautiful. The print looks way better than the navy-green; richer colors, and I love the overall rosebuds. Keeping this one for sure."
3.0,It was a cute and soft top. But the holes were waaaaayyy too big that I just wouldn't wear it.
3.0,"The leg holes in the bottoms fit a little snug, but stretched out a bit making them more comfortable. The butt of the bikini is full coverage, if you're wondering. I ordered the XXL and I am a 38DD/DDD and the top was waaaaaaaaaay too small. No way in heck did they fit in there. There arent as many strings as shown in the photo either. I can't wear the top, which sucks, but the bottoms are doable."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress. Everything about it fit well except the chest. I am a 38C/36D and the large squeezed uncomfortably over my chest but fit well everywhere else. I was so disappointed because it was so cute
3.0,"Beautifull sunglass, color is great"
3.0,nice strap but cumbersome and time consuming to adjust. no real stretch capability so adjustment needs to be precise and due to cross strap design this is slow process.
3.0,The large is very big !
3.0,"Dress runs big, a little darker in person but still a pretty silver."
3.0,Proper fit.<br />Cloth is stiff. First day worn started getting line indentetions.<br />Not worth the money. Go with leather better.
3.0,Looks cuter in the picture but it's still a nice piece of jewelry
3.0,Definitely size up. Runs small. 7/8 fits more like a 5/6.
3.0,"Be sure you buy a size or 2 larger than your size.  They fit great, looked great, and were extremely comfortable.  But, after the first wash in cold water...I can’t wear them anymore.  I got another pair and I hand wash and stretch it out on 2 separate  clip hangers to be able to wear them.  It’s like the old time pant stretchers from the past, you have to block them to be able to wear them."
3.0,"It's cheaply made, but cute once you put a tank top over it. The cups are very small. The girl in the picture must be an A cup."
3.0,It was a much lighter color than pictured and the sleeves were way too short. I ordered a medium but it was much tighter and more clingy that I would think for that size.
3.0,"I didn’t think the slit was that deep on the picture but when received it, it was.Then when I sat down it really opened. I had to add more material to the opening so my thighs weren’t showing.😮"
3.0,"No me agrado el color, el color seleccionado era blanco y llegó gris"
3.0,"Color fades very quickly, after being washed twice...."
3.0,"I had really high hopes for this suit. The design looked so flattering on everyone in their reviews. My problem is with the top part of the suit. The cups are not nearly big enough for your boobs. I have C/D sized boobs and ordered according to the size chart, and the underwire came half way up my boobs. The bottoms fit me great, and so did the rest of the top. If the cups fit appropriately, I would have kept this suit."
3.0,Not what I expect.
3.0,"I got a XXL, i am 5&#34;7 and have 39&#34; Bust. The fit is much much boxier than expected, but sleeves, length, and bust all fit great. Luckily, I know how to sew, so i'll be taking it in a bit to give it a nicer shape.<br />For the price, it's pretty good."
3.0,"170lbs  5'9"" Medium.<br />Pants a good quality. But they are spandex feeling more than fabric. Which I don't care for. They do have the V in back to shape your booty nicely. They weren't totally squat proof and they will not stay in place. I felt like I had to keep pulling the up just looking at them in the mirror!"
3.0,"Wow, this dress is orange!  I actually like orange dresses and have a few, but this one looked like an orange highlighter!  Besides that, it did fit well and was cute, but I couldn't get over the color and had to send it back.  If you order it, just know its really really bright."
3.0,Too big. Wife regifted them. No biggie.
3.0,Made me look like I was pregnant.
3.0,These were not at all what my girlfriend was expecting when she ordered them.  Way too large.
3.0,"It's soft and way larger than expected. When unzip, it would look cheap, as outer lining/cloth of zipper shows off."
3.0,"Only 3 stars because the fit is too small. But, the flowers are so beautiful! The shirt is well- made!"
3.0,They block the light but are very light and feel almost cheap. For the money they are ok
3.0,My daughter is in love. It is just hard to keep on her head.
3.0,the so called fleece made my shirt black from all the lent that came off
3.0,ordered a 2Xlarge. coulda went with 3X does not fit like I expected
3.0,super cute just longer than i expected. comes way past my knees but still cute
3.0,I love the bra but have trouble opening it.  My hands are not strong enough to do it easily and it takes five minutes at least to get on and off or else drag it down and take it off over my feet.  What a drag!!!
3.0,It hangs backwards and has the red cross logo. I specifically chose it because it is the only one that did not show the logo in the picture. But it works.
3.0,"Basic winter hat, Loki g to replace my older spyder winter hat which had the spider sewn into the material. This will do as a replacement fleece lining will be nice in cold weather."
3.0,The wrap around strings are a bit long but blouse is cute.
3.0,Definitely not joggers they are leggings and I got a size small they are big in my crotch and the backs of my knees it’s very uncomfortable with extra fabric there I’m 17 5’5 and 150 Ib
3.0,"Love the outfit, however the zipper gets stuck a lot"
3.0,2xl fits morr like a large.<br />Too tight and the material is too thin..
3.0,A bit large for my husband's head. The under armour ones fit better but might not be the case for someone with a bigger head.
3.0,Pretty small. Def pay attention to the measurements because if you are bigger than a 34 band on the top and 36 waist/hip (depends on where you place it) it won’t close fully on the bottom.
3.0,"The ring is comfortable to wear, however, I do not like the color of the gold.  It's kind of an orang-gold.  Ultimately I won't wear it.  Also, it's too light, I thought it would have more weight to it.  :-/"
3.0,"After ~ 6 months of use,<br />- the upper zipper cannot hold much anymore, if there is a little pull on it, it will open BEHIND the pull.... so I have to pull it with force and close it again....<br />Also, the<br />- upper opening is tight, smaller than letter size. If you have papers to put in, you have to roll them to get them in. Inside, there is enough room for letter size documents...."
3.0,"The shirt is fine but it was a stiffer fabric than is featured. It's a women's cut and shorter than expected, so order a size larger."
3.0,They run small and have to return.
3.0,Did the trick for my 7 year old's Cheshire Cat costume. Delivery was fast. They could've been a bit larger for more Halloween impact.
3.0,"Received package early, my expectations were not real high because I was just looking for a cheap one season light weight hoodie. I'm proud to say my expectations were met. Light weight, keep the wind off me somewhat stylish hoodie...there ya go."
3.0,These boots were labeled as new but they were not. The toes were dirty and they had clearly been worn for awhile.
3.0,Too small... Asian size
3.0,Nice but a bit clunky.
3.0,Very small for a 5T it fits more like a 3T though my 4yr old is extremely tall for his age. Love the paw patrol design and is still good non faded after many washed
3.0,Pretty blue color but fit very awkward. I ordered the small and I am 5'3&#34; 110 lb and 32 B. I am very petite so the back of this did not fit around me as excess kind of scrunched up where the cross straps are. I had to loosen the straps completely to fit length wise. I am afraid due to how wide it is on me that a size up will be worse. Very awkward sizing if you're petite and short this doesn't work. If it fit properly I would give it 5 stars. The color is nice and material seems fine for the price. I may send back to size up but I could still wear the one I have uncomfortably.
3.0,They are adorable and if they could be modified slightly it would be a better product. If the posts were shorter they wouldn’t hang weird. Right now they look like a sad Mickey on my ears.
3.0,"Nice dress,fit very well on body,but tight sleeves and chest as usual with all this garments from China. Quite disappointed. I am size 16/18."
3.0,they were smaller than the size indicated
3.0,"This shirt is much larger than described. When I read ""loose fitting"" in the title I was thinking a sexy easy breezy shirt that I could wear for hikes and camping.  Instead, the shirt is more like a bag in it's shape and fit.  I'm a slender 6'1, 180lbs male and usually choose large for my shirts but due to the ""loose fitting"" descriptor I chose medium just in case.  Even though I chose a size down it is WAY too large. The cuffs go to my palms, the body of the shirt could fit another me comfortably inside of it.  The shape of the shirt is very boxy and not very attractive<br /><br />That said, this shirt would be good for those with a bigger girth. It is also a comfortable material and seems to give me the sun protection I was looking for. I also liked the cost and range of colors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- price<br />- color selection<br />- sun protection<br /><br />Cons<br />- a medium fits like an XXL<br />- the cut is very unflattering<br />- not the most breathable"
3.0,"These shorts are great material and very comfortable but they’re not “high waisted” if you have any kind of rear end. The front does come up to my belly button, but the rear end is not very roomy and barely stays up over your butt - again, if you’ve got any extra on your rear, these aren’t gonna be high-waisted. They’re like a hi-low waist, the front pulls up but the back isn’t very roomy and sits much lower, closer to where your underwear likely pulls up to."
3.0,"Ok to wear around the house, but wouldn't wear for exercise. Fit ok when I put them on, but they quickly stretch out and get baggy."
3.0,It was really small
3.0,"I ordered these a few years ago and ordered a range of sizes and then utilized free returns to assist.  I am usually a size 8-10 in normal clothes.  I think I ordered the equivalent of an 8, 10, and a 12.  The 8 fit great through butt and legs, but not a chance the waist was going to close (by like 4 inches).  Then the 10 was skin tight on my butt and thighs and HUGE on my waist.  And lastly the 12 was so baggy in the legs and butt, but fit perfect in the waist.  Clearly none of these worked, but I felt the 10 had to work so I ended up ordering another 10, just to see if the first pair was a fluke, and it was. These are thick leather so they are not flexible by any means.  And the lining seems to be sewn in crooked or something so they do feel like I will never win an Oktoberfest dance contest, but these are a costume and I only wear them once a year so it's good enough for what I use it for.  Do take advantage of the free shipping and returns if you have Prime."
3.0,"Product was delivered on time. Only downside they are not as thick as described,you can see threw them."
3.0,"I purchased two of these for male friends, but had to return them.  They're nicely made, but they are very small - I couldn't close the clasp, so I doubt the average sized man would be able to either."
3.0,Works great on batteries but the usb plug broke after 2 days.  Kind of disappointed but it still works on battery
3.0,Tear in the corner was not happy
3.0,"It too big in the top and super tight at the bottom. Not sure what type of person this was designed to fit. That said, the fabric and color was great. I read other reviews that said different colors fit better than some. I may try again because I do like it."
3.0,I did not realize the earrings were screw back...OUCH
3.0,Seems to be a decent wind and water-resistant and jacket for the price. I expect that it would be reasonably warm for a Fall walk.<br /><br />I normally wear a large jacket which allows enough room for a fleece top in winter. There is no way that I could do that with this jacket. I ended up ordering the XL but might return that too because of the hood that is supposed to fold down into a collar. There are 2 velcro settings that results in either a high collar or a very tightly rolled collar. Both versions look weird! It would have been nice to have inside pockets!
3.0,"It is so nice, fits well. color is vibrant as the picture, however it feels like wearing baloon like material!"
3.0,I’m told it’s comfortable and I can see it looks good but why does a shirt that looks old and worn have to cost so much?
3.0,"The shirt still looks great and its soft and comfortable. However, the size chart and the actual size are not accurate. It fits a bit snug compared to shirts in the same size."
3.0,This is an update...the seems are coming apart around the zipper area.  I am telling you I loved this bag until now.  I ought to return it for another because it is awesome but I guess the material is cheap!<br /><br />Perfect! Larger than expected but perfect for my mornings before work at the gym. Everything fits fine...bath towel face towel work clothes shoes toiletries makeup bag LOL
3.0,Very thin material and small for size! Returned the product
3.0,"The material is durable but the logo on the cape isn’t as clear as I thought it would be, kind of blury"
3.0,"This item cannot really be worn as a skirt. It is extremely sheer. I used it as a bathing suit cover up instead, which was pretty cute, but not why I bought it."
3.0,I loved everything abput this blouse except the size. It wqs too big.  I wish the sizing was correct. I had to return it.
3.0,Not my favorite bun hat. I have a small head and it is become a project buying a comfortable baseball cap that fits on my head without trying to go over my ears. I am still searching for a good cap.
3.0,"I ordered two of these for my daughters, blue and purple, but they are not the same size. I prefer the size of the blue one and it matches the web description. The purple is smaller and doesn’t even have the same label has the blue one or the web description/photo. I’ll have to returned and hope they have the purple one available."
3.0,"This is pretty, but the loops are smaller expected. That's ok though... It looks nice with what I pair it with, or just by itself."
3.0,I was expecting a Sun and Moon necklaces and ft best friends necklaces instead...still cute though.
3.0,like the style but it was a tad to small & the hysterical is cheap
3.0,"I like the blush color frames but I thought these were sunglasses. The lenses are totally clear, not tinted at all. It looks like i am wearing regular prescription glasses. Not cute."
3.0,The box is dammage
3.0,"REALLY large frame, even on my basketball sized head. Very light plastic feels cheap but they do work. For the price guess I can’t complain. They do feel like a cheaper quality than drugstore glasses for a few dollars more. 👎"
3.0,Fell apart faster than I would have expected.
3.0,The suspenders worked great. The bow tie's clasp broke at first use.
3.0,I ordered these in small and they were too big for me. I sent them back.  Not bad looking but don't know after washing.
3.0,The picture is deceiving the fullness is not at all.
3.0,"Its a meh product really.  Its good if your 13-16 years old. For adults, just say No."
3.0,"I like the small size its what I was looking for on nights when I dont want or need a bulky purse. It can get very tight when its full but its not big so that's expected. The strap is a good length I have trouble with other crossbody purses the straps have been too short for a curvy woman but this one has a nice long strap which I enjoy. My only complaint is whenever I open a zipper its big production and time consuming to zip up again, its like a riddle you have to solve to finagle the zipper shut again its annoying it always catches and jams."
3.0,"Cute design that covers all my unflattering areas. It fits a little smaller than expected and it is warmer than expected. Of course, you don't notice the warmth once you get in the pool."
3.0,"The design is awesome (just a bit long) but the fabric is a slick heavy polyester. The gown doesn't flow or feel right. It would be so much better if it were made of a soft cotton.  I doubt if many USA women would choose this fabric. In my opinion, if the company would make this design with a better quality fabric, they could sell this item at a higher price and have many more satisfied customers.Sadly, I had to return it."
3.0,The ordering size chart is way off. Came in 3 sizes too small
3.0,They look nice but 2 different sizes arrived
3.0,Loved product just to big.
3.0,"shirt is very cute but I would go with a smaller size than what you wear, I ordered a large and as a 5'5&#34;,150 I normally wear a large to xlarge and I would have ordered a small in this."
3.0,"The holding screw got unscrewed in my pocket after a month of the light use. Luckily, I didn't loose anything. Needs to be screwed in every couple of weeks."
3.0,"The charm on this bracelet is clearly a dove, which I love. Not that wild about leopards &lt;g>.<br /><br />The bracelet is very light weight and I hardly notice it. I was concerned  that the dangling cord and beads would bother me, but they don't at all. I do think this is going to stretch out over time and if it's too lose on the wrist, the charm slides around on the wrist.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the size of the little crystals. I can only see them in super bright light and they don't really sparkle at all. It would be better if they were larger - yes, it would mean less crystals but at least you'd be able to see them!"
3.0,Not bad for the price. They were a little to cheap looking for me.
3.0,Very pretty dress. Runs a bit big.
3.0,I like the style but it runs small.
3.0,Not a bad rag. But a rag it is. What can I say ?
3.0,I liked the print and the fit was very comfortable.  They are not for cold weather.
3.0,"This lanyard is made out of very light material, something similar to nylon? It's not a cotton woven twill, which is what I thought from looking at the photo. But the clip and construction and everything else are fine, and I'd still recommend it."
3.0,"Not the same as the picture shows 😑 Not completely different, but much bigger and less pretty. I bought 10 for my bridesmaids and returned them all. One came broken as well. Too big!"
3.0,"Cheaply made, they don’t pinch hard enough and the rings securing the chain to the clamp easily comes off. Perhaps invest in a higher quality set."
3.0,"These shoes were way too small for me even though I bought my regular size, so my daughter, who wears four sizes smaller than me, has been wearing them, and they are just a little too big on her. They are cute and comfortable, but that doesn't really matter if you can't get your foot in them."
3.0,Good quality except that the gold color fades after 5-6 months
3.0,"I'm an XS in a lot of things, usually have to get a S in bathing suits because they don't always come in XS. This XS, however, is TINY. The band of the top doesn't even reach to the bottom of my chest. This top was made more for a young girl IMO. The shorts were very small, too. I can get them on but they are way too tight. I should have tried a small, but am not sure the top would've still been long enough. The top is well constructed and the shorts nice enough (I'm not a fan of the seem down the front or the waistband) but this XS is definitely made for a young girl's body."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress but I’m a tall girl (5’11’’) and it was too short for my liking
3.0,"The product looks really nice so I don't want to slam the product.  Also, they refunded my money right away, so I don't want to slam the company.  It says product runs small, order one size up, so my wife had me order one size up.  Even that was small and unwearable.  My advice is order at least two sizes up."
3.0,Extremely see through!!! But other then that it's very nice looking
3.0,Received items when promised however half of the lights wont even turn on. Very disappointed! Now I have to go through the trouble to send the items back!
3.0,"This cardigan leaves much to be desired, the texture is rough and the materials are very cheap.<br />Also seems like the sleeves run small because my arms feel very snug in the sleeve. I only use it for work and would not wear it out on any nice occasion. The material is also completely see-through."
3.0,The 12- 18 mo size fits my 4 year old😭 I just want gloves for winter play that fit my 2 year old!! The gloves are nice besides running big. I'm going to try the 6-12mo.  They aren't water proof but I'm go to spray them with shoe water repellent
3.0,"The sleeves weren't sewn as is pictured and they are both sewn differently. I found removing the sleeves gave the dress a nicer look because the difference was so noticeable. The dress was comfortable and I do like it, but just a little bit of a let down."
3.0,"Okay this looked more silvery metallic in the pictures but know that this is 110% white and a very chunky, plastic looking white on top of it. That being said, it is a sports watch and it is waterproof so the plastic will serve it well in that capacity. It comes with decent instructions and I had it set in just a couple of minutes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Everything works well and it was easy to set up.<br />Waterproof, so if you want a traditional watch you don't mind getting rain or sweat on, here you go.<br />Cons:<br />This plastic has the feel of a cheap 90's watch.<br />Looks silver in the pictures, but it is white white white!<br />Just about the thickest watch you'll ever wear.<br /><br />Its a waterproof sports watch. It does what it says. It just doesn't look very good doing it."
3.0,"The size, guality, but purple is very dark. No real shine."
3.0,It’s okay the part where the diamonds are is solid so the whole bracelet doesn’t bend and may even break but all in all it’s good for just wearing out to dinner or for a special occasion
3.0,The fit at the top was a bit too large so I had to get it altered.
3.0,Glasses fogged up.  No nose piece for bridge of nose.  Nice designs and adjustable
3.0,"I ordered a small because I'm a size 4-6. I got this for my bachelorette trip, but when it came in it was too short! I didn't find a model height regarding the dress, so I kinda just guessed it. I'm 5'7"" and and it hit right under my butt cheeks. It was too inappropriate for me, but if you're someone who's okay with that, then have at it! Other than the length, the fabric was of good quality considering the price and the top fit great!"
3.0,"Decent fleece, runs a touch small.  I use it as  middle insulation layer, a little too tight over multiple layers.<br /><br />Breast pocket zipper leads nowhere, purely decorative.<br />Zipper is backwards,  mens jacket with zipper release backwards"
3.0,They were too small and the material is thin so it's pretty see through. Mine also ripped not long after I got them so I can't wear the one pair anymore. Overall they were okay but I wouldn't recommend them.
3.0,Like it very much... But it was too small for me.. Went too order a larger size..was out of Stock..😕
3.0,Shirt is ok but could be better with the print looks like it’s faded
3.0,"Nice colors and material, I went up one size, but wish I had gone up 2 sizes. I am a medium and went up to a large. I wish these companies that sold rash guards would put some kind of sizing in the description. At least a weight or chest mesurement."
3.0,"This shoe was marketed as a wide in sizing, so I expected the toe area to be wider than normal, however, ordering my normal size and wearing with thicker socks, I still found the heel area to be very large and therefore loose fitting.  That is odd.  Having a wider front portion of the shoe is welcome.  Having a heel area that is slipping is just asking for a blister.  The shoe feels overall as if it is stiff in the shank area and will require some breaking in, however the leather allows the foot to ""splay"" out when you are walking around.  That is not normally seen in a work boot which are normally stiffer in those areas around the foot due to stronger material that is really about the protection.  This is not a steel toe, so I didn't expect that, but I would expect a feeling of safety in a shoe touted as a work boot.  I would hesitate doing work in this boot that required heavy object moving or anything using cutting tools such as a chainsaw as this shoe provides minimum protection.  It looks stylish and therefore would be better suited towards looking as if you are working rather than actually doing the work.  I would wear it for riding my tractor or my Zero turn as I like a work boot on when using those tools, but I don't expect to do too much other than the occasional getting off the equipment to move something or walk through some mud or muck.  I would do that with these shoes and not have an issue."
3.0,Runs kinda small
3.0,Nice heavier material but way too short! I am 5’4”  and they came up about an inch above my ankles! Looked more like capris. I was looking for a nice breezy pant to wear after a day at the beach or in the pool..
3.0,I’m 5.5 Way too long dress and see trough bra. But cute color.
3.0,"Too small, and it’s definitely the same size I usually order."
3.0,This swimsuit is really cute but doesn't offer a lot of support in the top. I felt like I was going to fall out of it at any moment. Not to mention one of the clasps on the top broke within 5 minutes of having it on. Nothing a quick sewing job couldn't fix. I will most likely buy another top with more support to use with the bottom of this swimsuit. Shipping was very quick.
3.0,These sandals are not a 5 but not a 1 either. I give them a 3. The front strap is a lil large but nothing I can't handle. The heel is quite comfortable . Only time will tell on whether they wear as well as the heel projects.
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but unfortunately I do not. It doesn't look like the picture; it's kind of baggy in all the wrong places and makes me look frumpy. It's also super itchy, even after three washings. I will probably end up donating it."
3.0,Good product but Not designed for big breasts. I had to return it
3.0,"My Size: 5’3”, 115lb<br />Size ordered: Small 29” inseam in Khaki and White<br /><br />While we love the high waist and wide leg fit and drape/flow of the fabric, it shows every everything from undergarments to dimples.  The fabric acts like some kind of knit jersey, not like expected as sweatpants or fleece-lined material, sadly.  I removed 2 stars for the see -though nature.<br />Change the fabric and keep the style!!!"
3.0,This suit was to big for me and I got it for a XS and I’m usually a XS.
3.0,"They’re cute but pretty large.  They also don’t seem very durable, but I didn’t wear them.  Returned product."
3.0,It was not as soft as I had expected.
3.0,Disappointed in that it needs an iron.
3.0,"Got it for a gift, need better container bc no box jusr plastic package."
3.0,"I've gotten better ones at Walmart.  They are really long, the inside part it actually kind of sharp, and the front part (gem) is huge, doesn't really keep it hidden I have my lip pierced at work....the customers notice more when I wear these then my actual metal lip ring with a diamond on it!"
3.0,Not as pretty as it appears.
3.0,Did not like this product and it was returned to Amazon
3.0,Returned. They are made of a linen material and were not as comfortable as I hoped. They also run small.
3.0,The bag is 15 x 13.5 inches
3.0,I was bummed that this hat wasn’t a bit deeper because it was actually pretty cute besides the fact that it arrived smashed. If you like hats that sit low (over your ears)…this won’t work.
3.0,I thought this was the answer to my grandson always breaking the arms on his glasses. The arms on this pair are in good shape. However the plastic piece on the outside of the frames broke and we lost the lens. I plan on buying again as a backup pair of glasses.
3.0,They are nice but they came in a bright Christmas red color. I was expecting something closer to the photo.
3.0,"I bought the 12-Pack for my sister and I to split. We wanted marled socks to wear with our bean boots and these were one of the cheaper options. As the other reviews mentioned, they aren't thick camp socks, but rather regular (thinner) socks with the same marled look. My bean boots are tied with the eastland knot and these socks constantly slip down when I walk, which is disappointing. However, if I tie my bean boots the old fashioned way, then I can tighten the shoe enough for them to stay up. I wear shoe size 7.5 and these were meant to be up to shoe size 6-9 and sock size 9-11, so I was hoping they would stay up a little better. Overall, I'm satisfied with the marled look and I like thinner socks for summer rainstorms, but I did wish they had a stronger elastic band to stay up. Also, they were pretty cheap. It did take a while for them to come (Ordered on April 9, Received on April 22), however they were all individually packaged well."
3.0,"Very cute, love the color and the leopard and mesh bits but theyre not quite right on me. I'm 5'9 and 135 lbs buy the medium was pretty darn tight and the legs a little short. The material is thick and the waist super high so when folded over its even tighter and thicker. Returning."
3.0,The costume itself was awesome but I wish it would’ve been true to size. It was tight around the butt area and also the straps were very tight around the thigh area. The neck area was loose.
3.0,I saw a small difference
3.0,nive color
3.0,I love these but they ran a bit small
3.0,"I ordered these masks specifically because they were advertised ""Made in USA"". When I received them I was disappointed that there was no confirmation of being made in the USA on the masks or the packaging. I wrote to the company for confirmation but never received a reply. I assume that it is false advertising and will not order from XCHIME again."
3.0,"I ordered a size S (which I normally wear as I am size 4). It was really small. So I returned and ordered a size M - and it seems like the exact same size as the S. I can hardly get it over my head, and it's super snug. Not much stretch to the fabric either, so sadly I have to return again."
3.0,"too small for large busted woman, really cute other than that."
3.0,"I really like this shirt, but I don't like how the shirt dips under the arm. You have to wear a shirt underneath."
3.0,"I love the shirt but the cut is not the same as the picture. It is not oversize unless you will purchase a two times higher size than you normally wear or else it is just a shirt that has a tale on the back. The sleeve is not long but a ¾, I wear size small on US sizing so I ordered medium assuming that cut is exactly the way it is on the picture. Since I am short the front length of the shirt is just enough to cover the buttons of my pants and the back long enough to cover your behind. I don’t know how would it look on a tall woman but I believe it will not going to look good. The fabric is thin which is great I can wear it on the hot Florida weather but still I had to wear camis underneath though it is not super thin but you have to wear it because it still going to show your body. I am giving this a 3 star because the design need improvements. The stitches are fine for me it is well sewn I don’t have issues with it. All in all it is an okay shirt.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I received this product for free and to review. My review is honest and unbiased; it is based on my experience by using the product. As a customer I also rely on reviews before purchasing the product which honest review is very important for me. I am proud sharing this review. Thank you."
3.0,Oh gosh much to small. To bad they are so small  becasue they are a pretty earring.
3.0,Very stiff uncomfortable shoe boot. I had to buy shoe insoles for padding because it felt like I was walking on concrete.
3.0,"I like the way it fits around my neck which has arthritis and keeps the chill out. However, I agree with prior criticism<br />about the zipper which is low quality."
3.0,My daughter wore these only a handful of times before the bottom separated from the shoes.
3.0,"Pros: Look great, exactly as pictured. Gold colour is very nice, not too bright! Very soft, very comfortable ( surprisingly for my small, and a little wide feet, which are flat and often in pain)<br /><br />Cons: The leather ( can't tell if it is genuine or not) cracked on the border only after a day or 2! This is somewhat disappointing... Although being so inexpensive I was hoping to have some descent looking shoes especially after finding them so comfy...<br />I wear size 5 ( 35 European) . Ordered size 4.5 and they a little bit loose<br /><br />I would give 5 stars if the leather was a better quality and didn't tear that soon!"
3.0,"Material nice, but runs small."
3.0,The company's size chart toes not account for height. Bought the right size per chart. Shirt was snug around waist + hips but loose at the shoulders
3.0,L❤ve the Retro look. Received alot of compliments. 🖒
3.0,I do like the dress and the fit but it's completely see threw. You need a slip or a body suit to go under neath. Other than that it's cute!
3.0,"They run small. They do fit & are pretty comfy, but due to them running small I don't expect them to last very long."
3.0,"This feather boa looks nice, but when putting it on the ends of the features are hard and you can feel them on our skin.  A bit itchy."
3.0,"I really love the material and the fit is nice, but the side seam hem bells out at the bottom. I first got black, saw it fit well and ordered the green before wearing. Before second order got here wore the first for a day. I kept the one I wore, but sent the other back as it has the same issue. It might not bother someone else....but I really don’t like what it does at that seam."
3.0,It looks nice but is not soft. It is very itchy
3.0,"Beautiful yet doesn’t meet in front, is a open coverup that ties under breast I wear US 10-12 so not as lose or flowing as expected. I’d suggest for US normal size 6 -8 wanting open cut style.  Pretty packaged nice gift.  I’ll need to return mine"
3.0,I am going to have to work on making it larger
3.0,"Nice belt, didnt realize it was going to be shiny"
3.0,The good is almost comically large.
3.0,"The chain broke while I was wearing it for the first time, but I fixed that problem with some extra chain and a new clasp."
3.0,Ran on the smaller side but overall okay
3.0,Fits fine. Not the most quality fabric. Probably will only last a couple of washes.
3.0,I’m petite at 5’2 but there’s almost no length to the torso. You have to wear the waist a the natural waistline or the skirt won’t lie right. But then half your chest will be exposed...gorgeously intense forest green colors though.
3.0,THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE DRESS IS NOT THAT DARK LOOKS WASHED OUT BUT STILL OK
3.0,"I bought this because I wasn't sure if I wanted to wear a veil for my wedding or not and I wanted to get something inexpensive for my hair trial. The netting is a little misshapen, but its pretty. Overall, decent for the price."
3.0,"You will probably like these. Of course, you can use them for reading only. You can't drive with them. From a practicality standpoint, what is the use? I read mainly inside. Seldom do I read outdoors. I had my husband try them on, he wasn't too keen on them. Oh well."
3.0,"I love the pattern and length of these shorts, however, the legs are very wide, and I have very muscular legs so I cannot imagine how huge they would be on someone with slimmer thighs."
3.0,"It is a cute bathing suit but unless you have big breasts, the top is too loose.  The bottom fit great but the top was huge and there is no way to adjust the strings to make it tighter.  I returned it."
3.0,"Shirt was super soft, however it was quite thin and already had fraying stitches on the shirt. Print is true to size though and the color is just like in the picture."
3.0,Ordered a 5x. Definitely not a true 5x. It would be a US 2-3X or men's 44. However material seamed nice. Not lined nor are they sweat pants.
3.0,"This is an OK necklace for the price. Looks great. Price was incredible. The clasp is VERY flimsy, I expect it to break any day."
3.0,to thin for me
3.0,"I dont really have big boobs, but you need to be pretty flat chested for it to lay right like in the picture."
3.0,Kinda a weird fit but not to bad
3.0,My daughter is 5’4 and 92 lbs so she’s on the thin side but she does still fit 14 normally but these were more like a 16? And the legs are pretty wide. She will need a belt because of the sizing. Thankfully there are belt loops. The material is fine but the pants look irregular.
3.0,"The collar is a bit big, I like to to meet my neck, as if I wanted it to hang down from my neck I would buy a v neck shirt.  Art work is great."
3.0,Constructed will but should have been larger (8&#34;)
3.0,"Beautiful color and good fit, but no top support at all.  Sadly, my double Ds cannot stand alone."
3.0,Larger than my size
3.0,This clearly says there is a one piece black underneath to this suit...not true. It comes without bottoms. It did fit well. Size seemed acurate
3.0,I’m very disappointed in the quality control. I’m missing a button and the other buttons all required sewing.
3.0,I bought an xl (normally a size 12) and it fits comfortably. Fabric is a little course but the dress is pretty. I had to give it 3 stars because it was missing a button. I have to decide if I want to keep it and fix it or return it.
3.0,Wet disappointed. They bent and broke after a week of wear.
3.0,"Pictures are misleading. The ad makes the ring looks truly metallic, like real gold. What you actually get looks more like brushed, dull gold that looks, frankly, like a silicone imitation of gold.<br /><br />They wouldn't have had to embellish the photos, because it's a good fitting, comfortable, attractive ring. Unfortunately, the exaggerated photos leaves the buyer with the feeling that they misrepresented the product."
3.0,I bought these for my 2 year old because she has sensory issues and likes to put my brothers head phones on when things get loud in the house.... maybe its because they are still new but they look super small and were tight around her head. They were difficult to make bigger and pull apart to get them over her ears. She doesnt care for them much
3.0,Kinda fits the Land Cruiser key.  There are gaps at the seams and you sort of have to force it.  I would say it’s an 80-90% correct fit.
3.0,"I've been using these gloves for over a month now and I really love the quality and style!  I ordered the brown ones, and I wasn't sure if they were real leather at first but they definitely are.  They have a wonderfully thick quality but they are fairly easy to be nimble and manipulate objects with.<br /><br />EDIT: It's been a couple months and I've been using them heavily, but they've alread started to peel a bit on the top of the hand. Disappointed that I'll have to get another pair and find another brand so soon."
3.0,I didn't like the type of fabric I thought it was free flow but it's snug on the body.  It could be beautiful if it didn't fit in this fashion.  I like the colors in the dress though.
3.0,"Nice little bag, though have found the front zipper sides tend to unzip if the button closure is not snapped. I put a couple of safety pins across the zipper about half way up, so if I forget to button it doesn't unzip all the way to spill out contents. Other than that have been pleased."
3.0,This dress is sewn well and fits well but is very thin and too see through in my opinion.
3.0,"It’s a good length for work. Material is just see through, feels a little cheap. I’ll have to buy a slip to wear under it. But I think it will be cute with boots and a sweater for the fall/winter."
3.0,"this has to be a junior size small, not women's. pretty color, very soft, but way too small unfortunately. tiny petites only!"
3.0,These do not offer much support.  Order down a size as they are not sized accordingly.
3.0,The color supposed to be red. When I got it its orange looking.
3.0,"Looks great, fits great, smells awful. I had to wash 5 or 6 times to be tolerable, still has a noticeable smell."
3.0,"What I like about this jumpsuit is that it has a somewhat slimming cut (it doesn't bunch or add bulk) and the wooden buttons add a nice touch.  The color I ordered was Y039 dark blue.  This is actually more of a  medium blue color in person.  Another thing I didn't love is that the cuff of the shorts on one side has the thread pattern, and the cuff on the other side is plain (see the yellow arrows in the photo).  Other than that, it is a very cute little romper.  I guess it's the luck of the draw at where the fabric ends and the cuff is made as to whether you get the same pattern on both sides.  Maybe you will be luckier than I was.  The size is basically what you would normally order. You do not need to size up with this.  You should be able to wear your typical size."
3.0,Great craftsmanship with one con - too heavy!!! Had to return it. C/S (Kathy) was very kind handling the return - didn't have to send it back to China but to their U.S. wearhouse.
3.0,"Beautifully made, rec'd on time, however it was too small for my wrist. It would probably fit a teenager better than an adult. Great bake for the money but I had to return it."
3.0,"The dress is nice, but does not look as bright as the picture. It look more wash out."
3.0,Product a bit stiff and done of the glitter comes off
3.0,Too wide and the clips speared my glasses
3.0,Warm and just ok.<br />A bit lack of quality and not 100% comfortable but good for an emergency or to have an extra one.
3.0,It's fine. Just not remarkable...
3.0,Greta quality but run small. Size 5/6 for like a 4t
3.0,Nice - good for quick views. Just be careful of the color -the silvery is really a dark grey.<br />This are really just good for reading labels/books and then being able to look up with regular vision.<br />The plastic over the ear piece comes right off so just be sure you don't lose it.
3.0,"One ring broke a few days after I bought it. The rings are cute, but unfortunately too big to be midi rings on my skeleton fingers."
3.0,"These are okay. The actual earring hook is very cheap and poorly shaped. I had them fall out numerous times. I finally bent them so that they would stop falling out. They’re cute earrings, not super remarkable. I wear them with certain outfits. I don’t hate them, but I’m just not impressed."
3.0,I gave them three stars for color and the bottom of the bathing suit unfortunately the top is cut way too small even for a medium I can not wear it if you are the manufacturer and you're reading these reviews please look into the hole bra size
3.0,"Very small, too shiny to be able to tell what they actually are.  I was looking for a small earring, I do like the size of this earring, however, they are too shiny & the detail is too intricate for the size.  I can see why this product gets good reviews, appear good quality.  Just not for me.  May try to regift them to someone who would appreciate them!"
3.0,"Not a long sleeve shirt, 3/4 length"
3.0,"Only thing I didn't like were how the mouths looked on these mask, because I have one with the same smile but different mask and it looks better! But these mask have over all better quality then most on the market, which is what counts!"
3.0,it fits but it has a manufacturing smell of oit
3.0,It list cheap
3.0,"These camisoles fit okay and they are soft.  I gave a lower rating because it wasn't the silky fabric I expected.  I was trying to find something a little thinner and slippery, so there is no friction between the camisole and other layers of clothes.<br />Be aware also that they flare out a lot in a dramatic A-line shape, so there is a lot of fabric at the hem.  If you plan to tuck them into a waistband, there will be bulk.<br />On the plus side, they are quite comfortable when worn because the fabric has a very soft feel that is easy on the skin."
3.0,Fits good just should have went 1 size up
3.0,Fabric feels a little on the cheap side.  The lace at the bottom was coming undone a little when I received it.  I trimmed it up and it looks fine.  It is not real high quality.
3.0,"Bought this gaiter to serve as a mask. While it’s about what I expected, I did have to alter it some so that I could insert a filter."
3.0,"Though product looks good, it was very small for an XL. I would order two sizes up!"
3.0,"Bought a pair of these for my bf who let’s say is blessed in the pants department. Bought the xl recommended for him yet his third member kept peaking out during leg sessions and on his runs, have to send back unfortunately cause of the fit but awesome material!"
3.0,Cheap fabric but still looks nice
3.0,"Cute, but came in damaged. The sleeve was already coming undone at the seam. You can tell it’s not amazing quality (even though it’s dry clean only lol). Fits nicely though."
3.0,"Bought this for my nephew as he has started to ride horses at age 10. Not sure if this was going to be a forever thing so did not want to buy anything too expensive. It was a good price, but hat is very stiff. I am hoping it softens with use. He loved it and it fit well."
3.0,Very thin fabric and it fit larger than expected.
3.0,It was a beautiful dress but it was too small I will be sending back
3.0,"I did like the color and quality of this jacket.  It is perfect for casual wear.  Unfortunately, the collar was too small for me."
3.0,Fine for price- cute fashion piece
3.0,"Bummer. This top was absolutely beautiful, and again, well made. I was so sad to have to return it. I got an extra large, and it was super tiny. Please make this 1X and 2X for us tall, full-figured women. This is another top that can be worn all year round with leggings, boots, skirt, etc. Really gorgeous top."
3.0,"Most ppl complained about material but i think it was a great material. It didnt feel cheap etc. My issue is being sooo short. Im going to have to use it for a beach day or an event where my butt cheeks are normalized lol. Its way too short for me. If it wasnt for the material i wouldve returned it but its an ok buy ok enough to keep. Its really not a bad buy just the shortness. Im guessing its more for a super skinny person which im not big at all. Weight 145lbs/5'- 4""."
3.0,Light weight and accommodating..
3.0,It isn't what exactly that's pictured but it works J guess.
3.0,"The quality is very good, but the size too large. Not your fault. He will grow into it."
3.0,"The picture is far more faded than in the picture... Smells extremely strongly of vinegar. I wouldn't get this shirt again, I'll go to a printshop next time and get something decent."
3.0,"Edit: after about a month the Velcro on the back came loose.  Wish they would have lasted longer... editing star rating down because of this<br /><br />Cute, useful shoes for my son.  He liked the color option (army green version) and they are easy on/off and good for summer splash pads and playgrounds.  No comfort issues that he's told me about.  Note, on the back strap they have the word ""FASHION"".  Didn't realize this before we bought it- not a problem, just an FYI.  They are not as soft and flexible as some of the younger kid ones (like ones we've gotten from Carter's in the past), but there is a fabric lining (so foot doesn't really rub against the outside)."
3.0,I ordered the suit as someone with a larger past thinking the extra material would help to be able to cover and it did not. I will keep the suit because after removing the pads and loosening the straps I can make it work but I wish it was just a little bit bigger.
3.0,It’s such a cute purse however the FIRST time I used it I was wearing jeans and immediately the dark blue ink transferred over to the purse. I cleaned it and tried using it again but every time the purse would have blue all over it by the end of the day.<br /><br />That being said I loved all the space it had inside but I would not buy this product again. I was very disappointed that it’s not feasible for everyday women to use with jeans.
3.0,It was shedding the glitter while I was  putting it  on for the first time. buts ok for the price.
3.0,"It's pretty I just find it a little too long but it's nice looking. Also, be mindful because of the shape of the stone it can lightly scrape/scratch the area if pressure is applied accidentally and especially directly."
3.0,"The glasses look good, but there's a large area on the edge of the lenses that doesn't correct vision and is just blurry. Don't buy if you're hoping for good peripheral vision, or if blurry edges would drive you crazy like me."
3.0,Looks just like photo
3.0,Nice dress looks just as pictured. However  The disappointing thing for me is the material.  Too thick and a bit too heavy?
3.0,I really didn’t like the fabric which is a Jersey knit. The style was not what I thought from the picture. Has empire waist.
3.0,Don't work very well for me.
3.0,A very simple way to measure I foot. I use this in my practice and it works but I wish I had held out for a branock device
3.0,I like the blender but I’m not to happy with the way it blends the fruits. I even make it blend twice but there’s still lumps of the fruits.
3.0,"After washing the product, I noticed the thread of the material coming loose."
3.0,Nice dress!  Bottom fits good but the top is snug.  So if your top heavy beware.
3.0,"I'm 5'1&#34;, 102 lbs so ordered the XS. It is too large. Also, the colors are brighter in person which I really don't care for. On the plus side, it appears to be well made."
3.0,"Gloves are very, very warm but loose feeling and awkward around hands making it difficult to use on touch screen"
3.0,"Super cute, but these slippers did not last even a year. The sole of the slipper tore near the ball of the foot in both shoes. These were only worn inside."
3.0,impractical.
3.0,"I like these for daily wear, but the pockets tore after the second wash."
3.0,"Looks cute but not happy with the cheap material. I don’t know what material that so many of my amazon clothes purchases seem to be made out of but it feels shiny and not breathable, not really ideal for a child’s summer outfit. Would not buy again."
3.0,"I usually wear a size 6/28&quot; in jeans.  These are a bit large in the waist and the material is quite stretchy so I wish they came in a size 4. They are a bit loose at the hems but can be rolled up, too.  There was no picture of the rear and I find the embellishment on the back pockets kind of loud and obnoxious (silver and gray and white embroidery).  I'll probably keep them as they were pretty low-priced for this brand at the time, but will only wear them around the house, most likely."
3.0,This is only for a quick food prep.
3.0,"Order arrived promptly! But it is WAY too big for a normal woman’s wrist!! I will have to cut holes in it for it to fit my wrist, and I am not a small person. Sure for the price it’s a lovely wristband but it will probably be ruined if I punch holes in it, so I will just have to buy another. Just a warning for anyone who has smallish wrists? Honestly I don’t even have small wrists so fair warning to all."
3.0,Cute shoe. Ordered a 10 which I usually wear between a 9.5 and 10 and my toes were touching the edge. I love a wedge but this one was also way too tall in my opinion. Sent them back.
3.0,"These fit fine on my traditional Pandora bracelet, and it’s nice they come in a pair. I had to push pretty hard to get them on, but the silicone ring is flexible. The metal shell is thin and jiggles a bit around the silicone ring.  They work fine to keep charms from migrating around the bracelet.  However, after wearing for only one month, the rose gold color has worn off about half of each bead.<br />In summary, they work ok for the price but keep your expectations low and consider just getting the silver to start."
3.0,"Nice color, overall not  bad purse for the money.  Indentations on the sides of the purse .Does not smell like made in Italy purse:("
3.0,Fits ok but the bow fell off by the second use.
3.0,Shirt fit perfectly but pants were too short …. Will be returning to order a larger size
3.0,"Fits beautiful but its cheap and tight, but for the price is fair"
3.0,Very nice! the shoes are heavy
3.0,very cute little small
3.0,"Extremely comfortable, not grabby, nice high waist, but fabric very thin, only slightly more dense than panty hose.  Won't last through multiple washes."
3.0,The magnetic clasp unfastened and the bracelet came off. Same with the necklace.  Beautiful to look at but the functionality isn’t 100%.
3.0,"It fit ok, but the straps were about 5 inches too long!!  I wanted to return it, but since it shipped from China, they didn't want to ship it back. They said they would, but preferred to do a partial refund. I took the refund and intend to alter the dress. I ordered a medium, am 5'5&#34; and 150 lbs."
3.0,"The Vest worked well enough but the sash was a joke.  it was less than 24"" long and would never fit around my waist.  Get what you pay for in this case means flimsy material and basic construction.  If i wasn't late for Halloween i never would have ordered this."
3.0,Item runs a bit large compared to other similar products I have purchased.
3.0,"I like it, was just not happy on the size. It didn't fit my son"
3.0,"Not good Quality, .. little smaller...."
3.0,thumb and pinky length too long
3.0,This is such a great concept. Wish I could find a silicone lace up adhesive bra like this that would fit a DD bust. Way too small.
3.0,It was returned due to being too small in the boobs
3.0,They are good for protecting the toe area from creasing but really only fit comfortably in AF1s. I tried them on my Jordans and they're too tight w the shields
3.0,"Very sheer, must double-layer."
3.0,Size XL husband floats in this shirt.  Runs really big.
3.0,"So, so, so cute- but it does not withstand handwashing. The cubic zirconia fell out a week after I started wearing it. :("
3.0,Nice but probably too big to wear on other days than July 1st.
3.0,could of been a little more comfortable
3.0,"The belt came with the jewels already fallen off, and I had to super glue everything back together. The sleeves were super tight and I already have very skinny arms. But, the costume looked great."
3.0,"I ordered size 14-16 for my daughter. They should have fit with room to spare. The shirts I received were label as ordered, however, they are extremely tiny shirts. More like size 8-10. They are nicely made so we are very disappointed to have to return them."
3.0,Style was very cute.  Fabric was a little different than expected and sizes run small as stated in other reviews.  The fabric had a strong smell to it.  Seller did email promptly when I inquired about a return which was nice.  Overall the fit and fabric was not as expected.
3.0,"As mentioned, this IS a very sturdy, good looking bag. The deal breaker for me, however, for any handbag is the zipper: You have to hold the fabric end of it to zip it up. I am a lazy bones and need to have the zipper be a one-handed operation kind of thing. So, returned the bag. Also worth mentioning is that this bag, like some of this brand's bags, is very stiff. I'm sure with use it might loosen up but at this size, its a little like carrying around a briefcase. Too bad, the quilting is quite nice. Instead I got a different Travelon two pocket bag that has a zipper sewed onto the bag, and is less stiff."
3.0,"I purchased these approximately a year ago and can count in one hand how many times I've used them. Today I put them on for yoga ( they aren't sturdy enough for harder workouts.  Little support) and noticed a hole with a big run going down my butt cheek. The type you see in panty hose.  So disappointing. It's not wear and tear, it's jut cheap fabric."
3.0,"Shipping took along time and it was expensive.<br />In addition, when I received it I had to resew a seam"
3.0,"It’s very pretty and comfy, but the strap already broke. Returning it."
3.0,Tore after 2 wears
3.0,"The good- it holds so much stuff I couldn’t believe it. It held everything including my MacBook Pro, iPad, journal plus all my travel items for a conference. The straps are sturdy and even though the bag was heavy with my items in it, it was not horrible on my shoulder when wearing as a crossbody. The straps and bag design help distribute the weight.<br /><br />Love the bag other than the defect. I hate to send it back because i have another trip two trips planned. I may just cut off the loop.<br />The bad- i have only used it for three days and day two the front security loop ripped and had o my been used maybe three or four times being zipped and unzipped. There really nothing in it except my hotel key card or phone."
3.0,"It breaks very easely, do not last long."
3.0,The XL that I ordered fits my baby sitter who wears a size Small-Medium.
3.0,"The concept is good, however the 2 pocket version doesn't work.  Once you wrap the scarf around twice as you're supposed to do with an infinity scarf, both pockets are up around the neck and you can't really access the pockets.  On a positive note, my large phone did fit in the pocket, so maybe the one pocket version would work, but the two is useless."
3.0,"The dress fit cute and as expected. The color just wasn’t a true red, more of a mauve red, which I didn’t care for."
3.0,"Got this for a Halloween party this weekend, got an S.<br />The print is beautiful, goes well under black light, a little flourishing, but the fit is not good, it's all very loose.<br />I had to take it to alteration, and she took a lot cloth from it, 'cause it was veeeery loose, especially in the waist area and if you're short like me (5'3 / 110ibs), maybe you need to adjust the length of the torso too, is long. Anyway, after the adjustments, extra money, it was good!"
3.0,"If you have a donk, then I wouldn't suggest getting this. I wear a L and got a L. Everything fits perfectly and is neither too loose or too tight (and I have broad shoulders so I was worried about that). However, it does not go pass my butt. The front is a perfect length, but not the back. It would look silly with leggings or shorts due to its design. If i were to go up a size, I can tell that it would not be flattering at all because there is a lot of extra room already around the midsection.. Overall, very comfortable, but I won't be able to leave my bedroom in it."
3.0,"Pretty, but runs very small. I am a 2 X, always. The blouse I received was sized at about a Large. Disappointed."
3.0,"Obviously cheap quality, isn't actually turquoise but still a great belly ring"
3.0,This shirt is a nice color and the material is OK. But I bought as a set to go with the big/lil sis shirt/onesie from this company and this shirt is cut totally differently. It is not fitted like the other 2 girl cut shirts I received. It's boxy and boyish and runs wide and short. I'm disappointed my middle daughter won't look coordinated with the other shirts advertised as the same from this company
3.0,Much bigger than I expected.  Fit for an adult.
3.0,The underwire was coming up all the way to the armpit and kept poking badly
3.0,Overall it was cute but It just fit wonky. The armpits came up really high and the skirt was exceptionally long. The fabric wasn't exactly soft and it did not come on time (I bought it and another dress for my birthday party and this showed up 4 days later)
3.0,Like the style and fabric. I wear a size 6 but I ordered a size med which is an 8/10. the bottom fits fine but the top is a little snug for a med size.
3.0,Itchy but cute
3.0,These are not 16G they are more like an 18G or 20G. I purchased for a daith piercing but once I realized how thin they were I just put them in one of my lobe piercings instead
3.0,super comfy at first but they become excruciatingly painful after about two hours.
3.0,"The first time I bought these, they were great-nothing wrong, worked perfectly, and looked nice. I recently bought these a second time and the first bracelet had a broken charm separator. The second bracelet came crimped near the clasp, therefore I was unable to even put a charm on this one."
3.0,Material is not what I was expecting.. but it comfortable and cute..
3.0,"I kept this but now I wish I hadn’t. A small is typically the perfect size for me with PB, but this is way too big. The chest gapes and requires s tank top underneath. I have a very flat stomach but there is so much fabric at the waistline, it makes me look pudgy. The fabric is very soft and craftsmanship is great but the orange colour is a bit obnoxious. Not a soft peach but rather, a neon cantaloupe."
3.0,I ordered the 3 to 6 months and it looks like a toddler should wear it. The hat fit my own head. Very diappointed. Was given as a gift to someone else little one.
3.0,"The shirt is fine but I ordered a medium and they sent a large. Daughter already cut the tags off & is wearing it, works i guess just really big."
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter who is almost 12 in April. She weighs about 100 lbs & is 5’1. I love everything about it is that the actual feel of it. It seems to be pretty warm, and very aesthetically pleasing to the eye….. I just cringe every time I have to wash and hang it up. my daughter seems to love it and doesn’t have the same reaction when she touches it that I have."
3.0,Not the ones I thought they were.
3.0,The plastic part on some of the rings are too big to keep it in place. I've had several tragus earrings fall out and have lost them.
3.0,"Fitting is good fit to size, cutting was ok not perfect. Material is not the best but again it was also at a lower price compare to other dress. It would be a cute winter outfit and easy to match."
3.0,My brother has a hat like this and I was surprised how big this was. If you have a larger brain cage this is for you.
3.0,They are comfortable when you first wash them and put them on but by the end of the day they stretch out a lot and really don't offer much support.
3.0,There is no RED at the top of the rainbow legging
3.0,The leggings only take care
3.0,I really wanted to like these socks for my yoga class. I have a rather small foot though and by the end of the class they were pretty stretched out and the sticky gripper part wasn't on the bottom anymore. They would probably be fine for someone with a larger foot.<br /><br />Update: I have worn one pair of these 3 times and they already have a hole in the heel.
3.0,I like it but I wanted the one in the picure. I don't like all blue but I am OK with it.<br /> So if order it you might get the shirt instead of the one that's actually pictured.<br /><br /> It fits good.
3.0,"the material is pretty thin. I prefer the material to be thicker to provide more support.<br />the stopper on the heels is good and they do not slide off when putting on/off shoes. so thats a plus, but again the material is too thin."
3.0,I have small dog and hoddie came even smaller so buy larger size because size S will not fit even for toy terrier.
3.0,"They don't shimmer like the picture. The material is almost course, but is soft."
3.0,It's a very pretty pair of earrings. But very small and delicate. It's more appropriate for a young person/child. I did look at the display photo and this is deceptive in that it appears bigger. I will give this as a gift to a younger person as they are to small for me.
3.0,"These are flea-market quality socks... at a flea market price.  So I guess I can't complain.  These are made from VERY thin material- you can see through it on your foot.  Also, they aren't what I would consider &#34;no show&#34;.  As soon as I pulled them out of the box I could see the ankle area extends farther up that it appears in the picture. I tried them on and confirmed this- there's a good 1.5 inches of material showing above my sneakers and that's after I tried adjusting the socks lower on my foot without cramming extra fabric into my toe area.  So on the plus side, no worrying about quitter socks slipping down in your shoe, but if, like me, you really prefer a no show sock, these are not what you want.  I'll probably just wear them around the house or give them to one of my sons who aren't as picky."
3.0,It was thinner than I had expected and I had trouble with the clasp.
3.0,"While I liked the design of the mask, and how the straps are adjustable to fit your face, the plastic around the mouth gets hot and uncomfortable when wearing it and it fogs up as you talk or even breathe. I should have know better than to order it for this reason, but I have twin grand-babies who are just beginning to smile, and, because I have to wear a mask around them right now,  I wanted them to see more of my face instead of just my eyes. All in all, not a horrible purchase, just disappointing."
3.0,"They’re very modest. Unfortunately they shrunk a lot after being washed, wrinkle very easily, and I just don’t reach for them :("
3.0,Corre súper grande
3.0,I bought this swimsuit because i loved the cut outs in the chest area but when I took it off I have black stain coloring on my neck and chest where the cut outs.  I had to scrub it off in the shower. I went to the beach and not a regular swimming pool so I'm not sure if the salt in the water was the reason it discolored.
3.0,"First, this is not the mosy flattering thing if you have any sort of curvy hips. Second, it was a bit cheap- looking, and ripped pretty easily. I would be returning it, but unfortunately it did rip a little so i will be keeping it for halloween or such. Also, the waist band is quite itchy. I ordered a 2x, normally wear US 16-18, and it fit comfortably with some room. I am 5'7&#34; and it camd down to a few inches above my ankles. Also not a flattering length."
3.0,Never got item
3.0,i guess i thought it would fit on my shoulders better
3.0,"This watch functions as described, but it's really a bit silly and I wouldn't purchase it again.  The colored sections of the 35 minute timer are divided into 3 - a curious choice since the logic games and reading comprehension sections are both four-part sections.  This watch would have been far move useful if the colored sections were divided into 4 equal sections.  If I were to do this again, I'd buy a regular analog watch and mark off 8 minute 45 second increments with a fine-tipped sharpie."
3.0,I ordered a medium for my four year old based on the sizing chart and not wanting her to grow out of it. She measured a 23 inch chest so in between sizes. The tightness was good but the neck area was just off. It was saggy and too wide. The design is just too boxy in my opinion compared to other tank top style shirts. I think the next size would be too tight and not fit the neck area.
3.0,I got these to wear for a fun run with a tutu but it was too cold so I couldn't wear them. The material is more stocking than sock material. Would have been perfect if it were more cotton.
3.0,Dress fits fine. Just runs too long.
3.0,Broke really fast but for the money it is worth it
3.0,"I love the design, but the quality of the print is awful."
3.0,"I love the color & quality of the hat, but it's too big!  One size doesn't fit all..."
3.0,Very cute and comfortable but top shrinks after first wash.
3.0,"I like this necklace, but it falls apart while literally on your neck."
3.0,Description & pictures show dress better then it is.
3.0,"Pretty solid set of lenses, but two lenses were scratched when I opened the box. Otherwise good product."
3.0,"i wear size 10 so but i got these size 11. it does not slip on easily, i have to pull and tug to squeeze my foot into this boot. my feet are not fat, they are average size."
3.0,"Material is thin and scratchy. It’s not bad, but it’s not great. Probably should have ordered a size larger so that it would fit like the picture."
3.0,They matched my blowfish tennis shoes but unfortunately I have to double knot them to keep them from coming untied.
3.0,It does the trick but can be a balancing act when using it. Also<br />it may be somewhat tough on your body without any sort of cushioning.
3.0,"not happy with the fit, the attached lace on the bottom is not sewn on properly and pulls it tight around the bottom...dissapointed"
3.0,Very cute boots not for small calves wish I could have kept!!
3.0,"I have bought a lot of Viv collection leggings and overall I'm really happy with them. They are pretty big on the lady pooch area, so they don't suck it in and control it like some other brands. I would recommend wearing a loose fitting top with these unless you have a super flat tummy - the waist band cuts in to create some tummy roll action. Great material and hasn't faded so far!"
3.0,Esta bonito y comodo.
3.0,didnt see any writing on it like the pic
3.0,Very cheap looking but my kid didn’t mind.
3.0,Shrinks fast.
3.0,"Perfect little bag except that the straps are only attached to the bag with knots.  I find myself constantly tugging on the knots to keep them tight as they loosen up as the day goes on.  That's annoying, I would use it all the time if the straps were attached in a more secure way."
3.0,Not a good fit if you have curves
3.0,"I have had these sets for a few weeks now and have worn them each once or twice a week. They are great for running, walking or HIIT workouts. The bra is surprisingly very supportive.  The only negative is that the fabric is very thin- similar to hosiery or tights- and does not keep you warm if you are working out in the winter outdoors, and they can easily run or snag."
3.0,I bought three swimsuits from this vendor and of the three this is my least favorite. The quality of the swimsuit is great but I think it's meant more for those women with fuller boobs and maybe wider hips. Just not as flattering to me so I will be returning.
3.0,I like the looks of these earrings just fine. They are hard to get closed but I knew that from reviews when I ordered them. I haven't been brave enough to use the smaller ones yet. I did find that if I put them on through the back I can see to close them better.
3.0,These shorts are very comfortable and I love the pockets…. Unfortunately after one washing the stitching is already coming undone  .<br /><br />Ps as much as I didn’t want to admit ….the XL does fit
3.0,My husband likes it...hair get easily caught in it.  Otherwise well worth the money.
3.0,"I really like it but there's no hinge on it to put it on and take off, so it'll probably break if I wear it a lot, so I won't. Love the design."
3.0,"They're ok, kind of wish they were all lace & that they covered a little more toe"
3.0,I really want to like this wallet but I just don't.  The only thing I like about it are the color and material.  It's built very durable.  I think it's just a little too big for my liking and the change pocket is so tight it's nearly impossible to get into.  I'm big on using change and I don't want to struggle with my wallet trying to get change out.  The pockets on the inside are also very tight and hard to get your cards out and in.  The ID pocket is nearly impossible.  Maybe it will loosen up the more I use it.  Who knows but it's just okay.
3.0,"Very good quality, very soft and comfortable.<br /><br />Only thing is that<br />“it’s too small”.<br /><br />My son is 13, 5’4”,<br />wears size 18 in boy’s size when trying out sizes in department stores (we went to target and Kohl’s).<br />I checked this sweater’s size chart,<br />measured him just to be sure,<br />and ordered the largest, size 18!<br />And disappointed to find it so small.<br /><br />My suggestion is that<br />This vendor should reduce it’s claimed size by 3~4 sizes downward.<br /><br />This sweater is really well made.<br />It it’s shoulder measurement when laid flat, is only 12”, I would guess it’ll fit an 8 year old with a bit of growing ease.<br /><br />I hope parents who likes this style, and are looking for sweaters for 7~8 years old boys can find this sweater, that’s how much I liked the craftsmanship."
3.0,"I read the reviews and bought two sizes and two styles. This particular one I was excited because its my true size. I am 5'2"" and weigh 155-160lbs and the dress is very long (below the knee) and fits rather large. I will buy a medium and see how it fits, though I worry about the chest area being too tight."
3.0,These earrings hurt because the post area is too thick but they are really pretty
3.0,Maybe my grand babies just petite but they are pretty big For her
3.0,Love the pattern.  The material not so much
3.0,"Very pretty, but I ordered these for the bridesmaid's for my sister's wedding and some earrings had a pinkish tint to them. If you are getting more than one, I'd choose a different pair, but all in all good quality for the price."
3.0,"2 out of 3, had a 2"" spot that the lace isn't secure to the shirt so there is a hole basically at least that's what it looks like. It is o  the bottom. Of the tank that the lace is coming off, missing thread."
3.0,"This shoe was so weird. The straps were too big around my ankle and above my feet but the actual sole part was too thin! My pinky toe was hanging off the side. The design is really cute and so is the color, but it just didn't work on me. And I would say I have medium sized feet and ankles. The quality was okay, definitely could be better for $24. I was really disappointed and returned it next day. I am a size 7 and ordered a size 7 so I would say true to size in that sense"
3.0,I did return them. But when I got them. They were very light and stretchy. I returned them because they were tighter on my thighs than I liked. Also noticed that they seam to run longer than the Hardlines.
3.0,The gap is way to wide so it doesn't look like a hoop
3.0,"I bought it for my daughter, whose in middle school.  Really only bought it for the brand name.  Thought the quality would be so good, since so many people wear it.  So disappointed in quality.  Would not recommend the brand, there are better quality sweatshirt hoodies for less money"
3.0,"Cute for my daughter, but not durable."
3.0,after wearing the glasses for a cumulative 10 hrs over a 2 week period I took a Ishihara test without wearing the glasses then again while wearing the glasses. I couldn’t see any additional numbers in the circle when taking the test wearing the glasses. The glasses will not help you pass a Ishihara test. They do seem to make colors that I can already see a little brighter.
3.0,"decent quality, the fabric is a little rough if you have sensory issues, the zipper doesn't quite line up well and is a little difficult to zip."
3.0,"I love the color & material. It's made well. I'll be using mine as a gift, as it's a small xl... fits as a larger. I do recommend buying, just buy bigger size!"
3.0,A little smaller then I wanted. And I'm on the big side.
3.0,"The fabric makes it difficult to slide your mat back into the bag. The size is nice for oversized mats, and the zippered pocket is great, but fighting with the bag after class slightly ruins my zen."
3.0,Only problem i have is that the color they display is not true. The image shows the sweater is actually gray at the top (it was advertised online as a minty green)<br />Overall the sweater fits great and feels comfy. Just gave 3 stars because i really wanted that mint green color combo 🤷‍♀️
3.0,Ordered the size that was recommended...wearable but quite tight!
3.0,Expected it to be warmer.
3.0,"Its definitely BIGGER then expected, very light weight. The outer pockets ... there really is just one, a mesh pocket and it doesn't have a zipper. The other &#34;pocket&#34; there is where the shoes or used towels or gym clothes go into. The Main Compartment is BIG, but there is no insert bottom, that's why its so nice and collapsible. The other pocket, the &#34;pouch&#34;  this bag came in, is an additional zippered pocket on the inside of the bag. holding maybe keys or wallet.  It does well for a traveling bag, but I had to go just days after buying this one and get me a smaller bag. For what I wanted it for... its not recommendable, however, for a true sports person, for Gym stuff, Towels, shoes.. etc... probable does rather well."
3.0,Pretty but too small for what I needed it for.
3.0,"This seemed like a great idea however I find that it adds a lot of weight and I rather use the pockets in my back pack than to have this thing.  Still I like the concept, design, and materials used."
3.0,The watch was supposed to come with a chain and instead came with two very tiny earring studs. I was very disappointed that I was not notified that there was gonna be a replacement. Aside from that the watch is beautiful and does have some weight to it my husband really likes it.
3.0,They look great. Only downside is that they are not wide enough. I think they fit more as a medium small width.
3.0,I bought these for my teenage daughter. Size 16 is the largest size in girls and it is hard to find in bikini. She won't wear briefs. I can also buy her women's size small or women's 5.
3.0,"design is good. material ok, size too small"
3.0,I love the colors but the roundness does not looks good.
3.0,I love the design soo much. However these are not good for yoga as the waist keeps sliding down leaving my bum crack exposed. So sad bc I wanted to wear them to workout. If they were cotton blend that would be better and a thicker waist band to be functional...now just for show. Maybe hiking...
3.0,I had to return because it gave me such a big camwl toe. I purchase two other types of high waited tights on Amazon and they didn't give me any so this one was voted OIT and returned back to Amazon
3.0,This shirt is cute on.....but it is a little bit thin.  I paired it with Rinhoo Friendship 4 pieces layered necklace moon star.
3.0,"Cute dress, fits as expected, nice and loose for summer. However, I ordered the orange, which appeared to be a burnt orange, and the dress arrived in bright red, so I will be returned. Also, in this color, the pockets can be seen through the fabric."
3.0,Stretches out at the bottom easily and this is loose on me. I ordered a large and I am 5’7” 185 lbs
3.0,[[VIDEOID:210a735fd572e04195ce608bf0896495]] It’s the same size as the small
3.0,"It’s a beautiful watch band, but less than 4 hours after I put it on, one of the butterflies came off. I was not doing anything strenuous, just driving and at the grocery."
3.0,"This piece was very pretty, but fell apart. I ordered a few pieces of jewelry, and almost everything was falling apart or messed up. I guess that is why it was such a great price..."
3.0,The hooks are too wide and they fall out.
3.0,Wish they had been larger!Smaller than expected even with measurements given!
3.0,"This is not a 'Women's Plus"" jacket. It's adorable, made well & even warm. However, it's a little snug in the sleeves. Now truthfully my arms aren't small but they aren't big. I ordered it thinking it was plus because to me it looks sort of like a 'junior's cut coat based on how the model looks, so I ordered the largest size. I was correct in thinking that, since I have worked in clothing retail before. When I tried it on, I actually would have to loose about 1-1 1/2 inches in my upper arm for this coat to be comfortable. It's fine with no sweater or thicker clothing. but I live in the north so that's not always feasible. Dont buy if you are anywhere near a size 12 & definitely not above unless you have a very slender upper body"
3.0,"Runs small.  Fabric is then and cheaply made. It is a cute dress and the color is like the pic, I got blue."
3.0,Its not as good as I expected. It slides down.it dont stay in your arm
3.0,cute but shrinks in dryer
3.0,"I was looking for midi rings and from the pictures I thought I was getting more midi then knuckle rings. Wrong! Out of the packet I got 5 midi rings fit for my hands. It's okay little hack put a little bit of hot glue inside of the ring, you'll get a closer fit and rings won't slide off. They definitely don't look like real gold so if that's what your going for keep searching. I do appreciate the pouch it comes with, helps me not lose them."
3.0,The stripes look as though they’ve been out in the sun. Meaning they are not the same gold thread that you’ll get from the Clothing and Sales on base. It’s probably nothing that would get you gigged but to me it is a noticeable difference in build quality. The size is also a little off as well. I needed these last minute so they will do until I get to base and have the proper ones put on.
3.0,"I bought the sky blue leggings. The color is great, the material is thin but comforting. The main reason why I got these leggings was to get the scrunch butt effect which failed because the stitching sits right on top of your butt. Which defeats the whole purpose. I’ll keep them because I love the color but other than that I will look some where else to buy leggings with the desired effect."
3.0,The photo makes the material look thinner and with more shape than it actually has. It's thinner than I thought it would be and the color is more grey than blue.
3.0,"-NOT- thigh high socks. I'm a smaller person and this barely gets to the top of my calf. I'm keeping the socks because I like them anyway, but if you need thigh high specifically, look elsewhere."
3.0,"I didn't realize this was real fur because of the mixed reviews, some saying it's real and others saying it was very obviously some sort of plastic synthetic fur. But this is genuine fox fur placed on a leather base. Some reviews threw me off because they said it broke immediately, but I tested mine and gave it a few hard yanks and nothing happened, the clip stayed on, the leather didnt break, not even any fur came out! All these reviews are very confusing, maybe I just got lucky and got a better quality one then some other people so maybe be cautious when thinking about purchasing this."
3.0,It’s a nice hat just small for my liking.
3.0,"This mask is not bad, but made for smaller faces.  The zipper works, but keep in mind it has a cloth liner under it, so if you want to be able to drink with it on you will have to cut the liner underneath the zipper and outside mask.  Not sure if this item is made of real leather it seems more like faux leather to me.  Anyway, I hope this helps you."
3.0,"Didn't like the fit around the breast area. Don't like the padding. Was a little long, even with heels."
3.0,"Sleeves are a little too wide, the rest was a good fit."
3.0,"The pin is lovely, and so I shall keep it and see if I can make it pin correctly. The back is one of those clips you squeeze and push over a type of straight pin...always reminds me of my old Girl Scout pins, ha ha. First of all it was bent. Then two additional issues: 1) they placed the straight pin at one end of domino, should have been in the middle of back, because it will only hang one way...gravity takes it straight up and down, hanging like a chime, and 2) the clip doesn't fit properly so it is is loose not tight on your clothing. Bad design except for pretty domino pattern side. Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Worth the money but the fit of the bottom is horrible. Looks like a diaper. You actually would never be able to swim in this if have a curvy figure/boobs and butt
3.0,I liked the look of this item but the size is smaller than states
3.0,"I am 5’8” and approx 160 pounds. I got the XL and while the front fit me well, like another reviewer posted it sits funny on the back right above the rear where faux jacket ends It seems to bunch up and doesn’t look good. Maybe the cut is wrong for my body type. Although the front is very flattering  because it seems to curve and fit where it should - the back view doesn’t look great. Material feels good but will be returning."
3.0,Great shirt. Runs a little on the big side got a XXl and certainly could have gone with the XL and had plenty of room.
3.0,Its a ok sweater. Thinner material than expected. Definatly not worth the 55 dollars more like a 30 dollar sweater. The print isnt of the highest quality you can see right through it.
3.0,My 2.5 year old daughter loved them. The run quite small wish we would have ordered a bigger size but good quality. She insisted on squeezing her foot into them right away or I’d send them back for a bigger size.
3.0,"I ordered a adult Med for my daughter, who wanted to wear it over sized. It fits more like a adult small. I recommending size up, maybe 2 sizes, unless you are looking for a fitted look."
3.0,The liner kept sticking out. Which is probably fine if I didn't get the dark colored skirt. Returned.
3.0,3 stars because when this arrived it had a weird odor that I had to let air out for a few days.
3.0,Fit perfectly out of the package and then I washed.  Cold water and the dryer and they shrunk.  I'll have to lose weight to be able to wear.
3.0,Turned my finger green :(
3.0,"I ordered these pants on 2 separate occasions;  identical except for the color.  One had a belt, the other didnt have a belt.  The picture doesnt show a belt, but obviously it should come with a belt as one of the pants I ordered had one.  By the time I got the second pair and realized the first pair should have had a belt, the return window had expired.  The seller , Little Donkey Andy, also did not respond to a message sent.  Poor quality control, and poor customer relations. UPDATE; following this review, Little Donkey did reach out and offer a 10% refund , which I accepted.  I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars."
3.0,Bought this for my teen but had to return because it was shorter than the pic. It hit her at the waist line. She wanted big and oversized. Considered sizing up but was worried it would just be wider and not longer.
3.0,"Color and style are great, sizing is way off!!! I wear large and both it and the extra large fit like a small."
3.0,"Overall, these are OK. They seem to fit true to size, but the quality is not great. In my opinion, you can get a much nicer pair for the price. The fabric is relatively stretchy, but is not high quality. I am always worried that you can potentially see-through these. I do not wear them to the gym because of this."
3.0,This was a beautiful anklet but it was too short for me. Had to return it
3.0,"Pretty dress, fabric was a bit too heavy for me though and this dress was tight for me in the bust area (I am 34D)"
3.0,"Nice material and really cute dress but the top is too tight, bottoms open up"
3.0,"I think the Dynomighty quality control is slipping.  These wallets normally last me a year.  This last one started falling apart immediately.  If anyone has any information, I'd appreciate it."
3.0,Must hand wash these pants. Fabric frays a yellow spandex on the Navy blue seams after a machine wash 😥 . Otherwise a great fit and style.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:65a4f4fd426a3be939b01f3baa0bf77e]] It was described as lips and red and black charms but only received pearls
3.0,Seems legit kydex. Clip very strong.
3.0,Very cute but cheaply made
3.0,Pretty dress but not for a tallish girl. A petite girl would probably like it.
3.0,I loved the bottoms. They are adorable on. The top is a bit bulky and tying it is impossible because it was to big.
3.0,"The watch band was nice, but we bought it to go with a white watch and it didn’t look right."
3.0,"The lanyard came in looking quite different then what is in the picture. It had the words Corvette and the logo on there, but it also has a Red picture of a Corvette. I don't mind to much, I just expected what the picture was showing.<br /><br />Also, the lanyard is stretchable, you can pull it and it'll stretch like a rubber band. Also not a bad thing, it is just not what I expected either. Would have preferred one that's not stretchy.<br /><br />Overall it's a good looking band, just not what was advertised."
3.0,"The buttons are cute and bigger than I expected. The keychain is detailed but the characters are small. Like other reviewers, I didn't receive the phone ring. This was a gift, so I decided not to return it, but definitely disappointed that it didn't arrive as advertised!"
3.0,Product sizes are listed incorrectly. 18/20 is an xxl. 14/16 is xl. Disney girls shirts only ho up to 14/16 xl.
3.0,"I like the suit. The colors are certainly true to the pictures. I am on the borderline between a C cup and a D cup. The suit is firm and I don't worry about them falling out like I have with some other suits, but it definitely does expose them and I think it looks a little tackier than I was expecting? I know that sounds weird because it's very clear from this pics that the suit is open in the front. I guess it just didn't occur to me that bigger boobs = more exposure than what the medium-sized boobs in the pics show. Also I feel like my back looks somewhat matronly because of the one-piece shape. I guess I prefer suits that are lower cut in back and higher cut in front! You will like this suit as long as you know what you're getting into. For the price, I am pleased."
3.0,"The color in the picture looks like a tan/caramel color.  The ones I got were more like light nude if that makes sense.  Not going to lie, the shoes are great and comfortable, but the color threw me off.  I'll wear them either way."
3.0,Loved the shirt but wore it once and 2 of the buttons fell off and I lost them. 😕
3.0,Sleeves are a little bit short if you have long arms. The main reason I rated it as okay is because the set I received is not made of cotton at all. Might be suitable for a Halloween party but not a serious culture event.
3.0,Dry cute shirt but easy to tear. I had a very small rip(hole) in the middle of the drawstring part of the shirt. Was there when it arrived ? Weird but I made it work and was able to conceal it
3.0,Very pretty but broke off in a month
3.0,The mask is a great size and a good amount of filters. But the nose didn’t have a wire and I really need the wire so my glasses don’t fog. The eagle and the Mexican flag are not as noticeable as hoped.
3.0,"Worked well enough, but wasn't exactly what I thought. I'll have to relocate the brand I originally was looking for."
3.0,"These are not Capri's, they go all the way down to my ankles. They are soft and comfy so I will keep them, but they are in no way a Capri pant"
3.0,"Looks nice when new.  After some time the ""engraved"" text starts to fade, i.e. the ink rubbs off as the lettering is not engraved into the metal."
3.0,"They're way too big. Length wise & the actual ""pill"". Just a heads up. They're cheap quality but I wasn't expecting much because the price is so cheap. I wasn't able to actually wear them because as mentioned, the bar was too long & the pill was way too big. It made me talk funny & wasn't comfortable."
3.0,"I like them but snaps would be better than the weird hook things they attach with, but they are ok but the fabric is not as soft as I would have liked.the over piece to be a little longer though so it would more easily tuck into my bra."
3.0,"This dress was not really as I had expected.  This fabric is very thin and just fits a bit &#34;off&#34;.  I am short and large busted, so maybe that it who it looked so strange."
3.0,"The color is not as exactly as in the advertisement. I ordered bright blue, but what I got is light blue. Disappointed!"
3.0,"These slippers are really cute, but we were disappointed with their sizing.  My daughter uses a size 1, but thought I'd order a size up, since she likes to use thick socks during the winter months.  Unfortunately the size 2 was too small and even with thin socks her toes were rubbing at the tip of slippers.  I'm assuming these were not even standard size 1.  Unfortunately a size 2 is their biggest...so we had to return them and opt for another style."
3.0,Ordered a size up like most have suggested and even then they barely fit. Another issue is that the rubber is already starting to crack and split in spots after only a few months of use at the gym for showers.
3.0,"I owned 2 of these and in the neck tag they said the size was &#34;medium&#34;, so I ordered 3 more mediums, but upon arrival they were far too large.  I then ordered smalls, and they fit exactly as the mediums I currently own.  Maybe they changed sizing parameters because people in general are getting larger?  Other than that the garments are terrific."
3.0,"Super gold, not very antiqued. Not the same finish as what's pictured"
3.0,look the outfit wear it to black panther premiere it was just way too big
3.0,"The NinaQueen Lucky Light necklace is very pretty. The color combination of blue and Sterling Silver is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />It came in a pink and gray jewelry box that when opened revealed a small plastic bag containing the necklace. We were excited to try it on and opened the bag to reveal a pretty blue pendent on a slim sterling silver chain however there was a huge knot. It took me 38 minutes, two tweezers, and a magnifying glass to untangle but once I did, the Swarovski Crystal was a truly lovely color.<br /><br />The jewelry box had a place to secure the necklace so I am not sure why it was placed in a plastic bag.<br /><br />Other than the knot it was a gorgeous piece which looks good on woman or young girls. The clasp is secure and I get a ton of compliments when worn.<br /><br />The first photo shows how the necklace looked upon taking it out of the bag.<br />The second photo shows the tools I had to use in order to remove the knot along with having to use two hands I had to place the magnifying glass around my neck in a sling so that I could look through it to remove. Wish I had a photo of me removing it as I am sure it was interesting.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a complimentary product for my honest opinion. My star ratings are exact based on Amazon's star descriptions.  My reviews are 100% honest and true based on my personal opinion not on a companies description or request. No monetary compensation was offered or received."
3.0,"the bottom of the heart was too sharp, keep poking my wife, had to return it.  We both liked the design though."
3.0,"i'm 5'2 and this dress fits me almost full length, (tea-length) so if you're expecting over the knee this isn't the case. other than that it's okay"
3.0,"So I got this for myself, for working out, and for a bit of whimsical fun.  It actually doesn't slip!  I wish the elastic at the back was more durable and a bit thicker, but for now it works (it looks like it will come apart soon though, as I wear mine two to three times a week)!  I also think the price is a bit steep for what it is but I guess it works as advertised for now."
3.0,"A little larger than expected, but still cute!"
3.0,"My dress didn’t come with a belt (as pictured), so it just looks like a big tent. Will have to return unless they can send a belt."
3.0,They weren’t as gray as I believed. Not real leather.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this dress. It fits perfectly - you just have to wear an entire body slip or it will be very itchy and uncomfortable. The dress is not lined but has tulle under the ""skirt"" part of the dress."
3.0,"I loved the look at them and the little trinkets and the bags to put the glasses in, but I had to return them the top safety gard part of the glasses on the Frame were way to big and bulky. The photo in the description looks way different than they were. The seller was great to work with me and give my money back. Will definitely buy from them again."
3.0,This is a thick and soft scarf but the edges are ragged and it doesn't have a very finished look to it.  It will keep you warm on a cold day but I wouldn't give it as a gift.
3.0,"The material is a little thin so you can see the outline of your bra if you are wearing one. I have not tried it with an undershirt yet, but the shirt fits well and is cute otherwise."
3.0,The spandex makes it do able but it fits much smaller than described. I wear an XL. I am short at 5' and this was not long like the picture. I kept it for around the house. Recommend ordering two sizes up if you wan it to fit like the picture.
3.0,"It’s cute dress, but insanely small. 5’8” and 135. Bought a medium and it’s really snug. I will suggest going up 2 sizes. The material does not stretch so if your big busted it might not work."
3.0,"The purse arrived on time and came wrapped in a nice bag. I love the quality and the two tone color ( sand/brown) however the first day I carried it I noticed the zippers unzip the wrong way. Or maybe I should say opposite than all the others I carry. Not sure if that is a European thing, but when you carry it cross-body it's more difficult to unzip the purse. I also don't like the zippers can give easy access to someone standing behind me to unzip my purse since they unzip right to left.  I will keep the purse since the price point is so low, might as well try it for awhile but I think it should be noted that it unzips from right to left not right to left like most."
3.0,Cute but seemed to run small. Wouldn’t fit on my head
3.0,was too large
3.0,Liked it just wasnt happy with how rough the short feels.
3.0,Beautiful masks but the stitching is not centered which make the masks look  a little bit crooked.
3.0,I liked the fact that the cloth isn't too thin or thick and it's light on you. BUT I didn't like the fact that the clips are fragile and break easily. 😕
3.0,Either my ears are mishapen or the earrings are off.  I pit the right one in and it fit my ear perfectly it takes a bit to figure out how to get the bottom part on your ear correctly but looked cute once it was on.  The left ear no matter how I did it made my ear look like a stuffed sausage. The moon part just didn't fit right.
3.0,it's a little smaller than the large band that came with the watch
3.0,"The design is pretty, however the straps are already scratched up and it's only the first day. The purse also makes a strange noise, like the noise a tarp would make. The material inside is that cheap fake silk that rips in no time so if it lasts very long I'll be shocked. I would usually pay more close to around half the price of what I paid for this purse in a retail shop. The silver is pretty, the straps feel sturdy, and it does come with a shoulder strap, however shoulder strap is not adjustable."
3.0,"Didn't pay much so didn't expect perfection.  But I would hope a functional pocket wouldn't be a problem.  The bag came with pocket upside down, and the zipper sewn at base instead of near the opening for easy access(see photo). Also the bag had a chemical odor and a few random defects in the stitching.  On the plus side, embroidery is bright and colorful and the bag is not too small.  Can hold a few items other than a cellphone."
3.0,"Not created shape wise for a competitive gymnast. The back is loose doesn’t conform to the body, thin elastic around legs. Daughter wanted the color for an event and wears it regularly."
3.0,Re  4.r
3.0,"I was to give a user's honest review of this belt and that is what I'm going to do.  First I couldn't select the size so I assumed it was adjustable.  WRONG!  Second it said 42"" on a ribbon tag on the back side.  I own a store and sell belts so I matched it and found it to be a inch longer than a 44"" making it in effect an odd-ball size of 45""<br /><br />If you wore a 45"" belt and if you wanted a oiled leather basketweave design black belt you may love this belt.  I needed a 38"" so I couldn't wear this belt.  I think the quality is good as best as I can tell.  I will say the antique brass buckle is simple but nice looking...but I know it's made of grainy pot metal dressed up so this is a cost cutting measure.  Solid brass or nickel is best for buckle.  Try as I might to discern if this is 2-ply or even bonded leather I can't say it's either.  I therefore think it is one piece with embossing to create the basketweave.  One piece is better than 2-pieces glued and stitched and those bonded leather (think wafer board but leather) aren't worth setting on fire they're so low quality.  Thus  I believe this to be one-piece and good in this regard.  I  think if they'd sent me a proper size I might well give this belt 4-stars.  But, they did not."
3.0,"They were alright, they wash up good, I thought they would have been higher up towards the ankle, but for the price I can't complaine."
3.0,This turtle neck is thin but perfect for layering.  Turtle neck too loose however.
3.0,"Cute pants, nice material but the waste and ankle bands are way to tight for my comfort.  Leaves deep band marks on my waste and ankles. Too bad because they are really cute. If you know how to taylor you could fix this but I prefer my clothing ready to wear."
3.0,Too difficult to size. Very flimsy fittings and couldn’t get back together .  Would like a refund on this but don’t know if you take back in this condition and I must ay postage?
3.0,"This is suck a cute hat but it is made for little kids not adults.  Also, the brim is really flimsy.  If you want to purchase this for a child this would be a great hat but for an adult with a regular sized head it will not fit."
3.0,"If you own an AR500 flak jacket or any flak with the  sleeve style cummerbund holders, this one will most likely not be compatible with it."
3.0,They shrunk too much after 1 washing. Now I can’t wear them because they are too short.
3.0,"Glasses are ok for the price range but feel really flimsy and cheap. They are VERY large but do work well on saving your eyes from the glare. They come with a nice case and a cleaning cloth and don't pinch my nose or squeeze my head, so that is a big plus.  I don't think they are going to protect your eyes unfortunately, as there is no claim made for any UV protections, just anti-glare. So keep that in mind, and know that with a super lightweight frame you are also getting a pretty flimsy pair of glasses."
3.0,First off this is sent vacuum packed. That's a good thing for sardines but a terrible thing for sweaters. There are deep horizontal creases and lots of them. Idk if they will come out with washing or not. The fit is skin tight. Like a body con dress. The model in the pic must be wearing 3 sizes bigger than her usual. This will be great if you want a form fitting sweater dress. It feels heavy. It just doesn't match the picture or description.
3.0,"The glasses look great and arrived before schedule, but the parts with the gold are made of really cheap metal and i wouldn't reccomend these for everyday use. I might buy a few other styles. I like the glasses alot but the gold seems like it will wear off quickly."
3.0,"It's fine.  Just a little scratchy, and not very soft."
3.0,Nice colour - nicely made - WAY to big.
3.0,"I just wear it around the house since its not really comfortable going outside wearing it. When sitting down, the short cripple so weird."
3.0,Honestly it looks cheap but perfect for a pre teen or teen girl
3.0,"I loved this dress/shirt.  The colors were vibrant.  The material felt great, but it was too small.  I was so sad I had to send it back.  I am a size 10 with slim hips and it was very tight around the hips."
3.0,"I love the watch, but I broke my tool trying to take the pins out to shorten the watch."
3.0,"The price matches what you receive but when I got a large the length was much too long, even when wearing heels as an above average height woman."
3.0,not a comfy feeling..too stiff and not supportive of feet
3.0,"It is a cute cardigan, made well but the arms are tight at the top. I ordered a size bigger for the flowy kind of look for the fall and it is more like my normal size rather than oversized. I have chunky arms and it is tight at the top of that arms and there isn't really a lot of stretch in it. Over all it is cute though, I would say 6/10 would recommend."
3.0,Product is ok. Will not recommend it though
3.0,Nice in many ways but didn't like not having a zippered closure over credit cards. This just wasn't practicle for me.
3.0,This is supposed to be a large but the arms are way too small<br />Manufacturer did not take in account for bulk of lining
3.0,It is good quality and true to size. My daughter loves it! The only thing I dislike is that the skirt is twice the length as a regular ballet skirt.
3.0,"This dress has an odd fit.  Cons: The cups are very long, and were not super flattering on me.  You can see gapping on some of the images posted by other reviewers.  Bottom half of the dress was super tight on the hips.  Straps are made of round elastic?<br />Pros: Beautiful floral print.  The thick &#34;scuba&#34; material of the dress would hide flaws."
3.0,"I like the color and print of this swimsuit, it fits okay, just a bit tight on the bottom. its made out of a thick material, the bottoms almost feel padded."
3.0,I understand that these masks are supposed to fit tight to be effective but they literally cut off all outside air and get extremely hot fast. If you need to wear them longer than an hour it’s almost impossible. The ear fasteners are tight and hurt if you have it on anything more than 30 minutes. I do like that they’re individually packaged. They will also steam your eyeglasses. Wanted to love them but just can’t.
3.0,Not quite what I was expecting but still nice for the price
3.0,"Super cute, and fit well everywhere but the sleeves"
3.0,He loves it got the pants to match but runs small ordered a 3x
3.0,"Very cute top, but when it says chiffon that's what it means. Absolutely see through. The shirt looks just like the arms. If you iron it, it will probably melt or go up in flames since it is so thin."
3.0,Was way too much coverage...looked like a colorful grandma bra
3.0,Lots of loose threads.  Cheaply made.
3.0,The material isn't like t-shirt material and it is see through. I have to wear a tank under mine to give you an idea of how see through it is. If I had known it was this material idk that I would have ordered it Tbh. It is super cute though! Fits true to size!
3.0,material to cheap
3.0,"I thought it was beautiful, but the biggest part was missing...."
3.0,Okay but a bit too heavy...
3.0,Just OK... haven't wore them in water yet... lakes are still froze over in MN.  :)
3.0,"Pretty is not a word that is used much anymore, but this item is simply pretty.  Not a high end item that will cause people to stop and ask where you got it, but on a day when you want to wear something that is pretty, but you will not be crushed if it is lost - this item is for you.  It is a quality item for the money."
3.0,I could get it on I just didn't like the firm bottom with no movement
3.0,"I got this to protect businesses from getting in trouble with patrons not wearing masks, since it's a joke anyway. I ordered one in black and one in purple. The black one had a side strap come undone after 2 short wearings. It was also itchy along the top edge if worn for long (I sewed it back up and it staying attached now).<br />It's very pretty and I get a lot of compliments on it and feel quite cheeky wearing it.<br />I would not buy these again."
3.0,Opening in front needs to have a button added at chest area and the skirt as well- flies open in the wind.
3.0,"Worn for fashion, I would never have trusted these as boat shoes. Never fit tight enough, despite ordering a size too small. Rivets came off almost immediately. Grip wore down quick."
3.0,"The pants were as described and I took a chance on them. The quality is good, but they are too see through for me. Basically they show every little thing!!! I won't be wearing them to the gym. At home is ok, but wouldn't want anyone to drop in unannounced! I will not be purchasing any in my future."
3.0,"Based on the reviews I excepted something better.  It isn't bad, it has a good thickness and a decent quality to it but the dress is only okay looking and isn't as comfortable as I had hoped."
3.0,good for large gym bag or small book bag. material and construction a little on the cheaper side but it is great for the price.
3.0,"As soon as I opened it I just disliked it. I mean it's only $160 but it looked cheap, stones didbt even sparkle so u am in process of returning."
3.0,"I really like the simple, yet stylish design of these retro round frames, and you can't go wrong with basic black as a lens frame color - unfortunately, that is only 2/3 of what makes eyeglasses (even non-prescription glasses) work, the other third being ""how do the frames look on your face? your overall look.""<br /><br />Just like with hats, what looks great on one person doesn't always work on another. The lenses worn by the models in this product description definitely look fashion-forward on them. When I tried them on and looked in the mirror however, it was obvious that the lens size was just a little too big for my facial dimensions, and were not flattering.<br /><br />Instead of one universal frame size, I think the folks at LINVO should seriously consider coming up with three sizes, consider this one ""large"", and adding a small and medium frame size as well. That way, folks who know what lens size fits their face best will be able to attain the right look."
3.0,They fit very nicely and the pockets are awesome but “squat proof” they are not. If you’re not doing squats or bending over they’re perfect. The people who designed these most likely have never done a squat if they think these will not show everything while doing one.
3.0,"I honestly was just looking for some black socks for my everyday wearing so I wasn’t expecting the best quality, but I’m sad that I’ve had washed these a couple times already and they are starting to stretch. It is a good amount of socks for a low price so I can’t complain much, the fabric is comfortable, but I think I’m going to have to start hand washing them."
3.0,I Got wrong color
3.0,Terribly made. Thin material. No outer pocket.
3.0,"Cute, however I like very roomy pajamas. I am an XL and ordered an XXL. They were still too small. Will be returning."
3.0,Cool little lantern...definitely smaller then I thought...its not very bright. Needs to be really dark to see it
3.0,These are juice classes only. Too small to be hold water and ice.
3.0,Band was to big for my husbands fitness watch
3.0,"This band is really pretty.  However, the screws loosen quickly and the small stones fall out.  I have only had the item for about a week.<br />I don't feel I am particularly hard on the item as it is to withstand workouts right?"
3.0,The back doesn't stay on as you walk. My heal comes out of the shoes and I bought my normal size.
3.0,Pants were nice but zipper broke after a month. A little flimsily made :/
3.0,"Mala calidad de la tela,el artículo no se parece a lo mostrado ni en el color"
3.0,Really snug fit.
3.0,It looks ok and is somewhat comfortable.
3.0,Small earrings.  I have thick earlobes.  It was hard for me to put the earrings on.
3.0,"I didn't notice that there is a large gap on the lace bodice, which looks a little weird in person. The dress needs to be taken in at the waist and hemmed before my daughter can wear it. It arrived VERY fast and it was reasonably priced."
3.0,"Was less expensive than other brands but did not fit me quite right.  I'm short and not long waisted.  The dress's belted waistline sat above my waistline more like an empire waistline.  The dress arrived promptly but had an unusual order, kinda of like rubber tires.  It may have went away if I aired it out but did not want to take the chance.  Company was great to deal with.  Received a prompt refund."
3.0,"Fit really weird,"
3.0,"It was as expected, def cute but very tiny and for a child. I was embarrassed to even give it as a gift to a adult.<br /><br />But very cute!"
3.0,The socks were adorable but rather thin.  Felt a bit more akin to men's dress socks than tube socks.  Was slightly disappointed in the overall quality.
3.0,Does not stop the glare as much as was expeced.
3.0,"This dress has very cute detail! I like the fabric and the fit. (I’m a solid US 14/16 in pants and ordered the XL and it fit fine around the waist and hips.) BUT she’s SUPER short! I’m 5’9” and this length isn’t appropriate for work. While with tights and boots it could work, you’d need to stay standing as bending down even the slightest would reveal too much in the back! This dress would be great for more petite ladies."
3.0,"Great fit, but a little deep. Sits right on my ears. Also, wasn't expecting the trucker hat front. Why is it so hard to find a good fitted hat?"
3.0,"Really tight around the chest, but it's light weight and easy to move in. I wish the pockets were well insulated like the rest of the jacket. For anything below 40 degrees, you will have to wear multiple layers. Definitely not warm enough for snowy weather."
3.0,"The clips disassembled for one of the four. I was able to put it back together fairly quickly with just my hands. It appears as if the metal was bent out of place. Other than that, the product is great."
3.0,"I really liked these slippers, style, cushiness, etc., and would have rated them with four stars a month ago.  But I went to wear them for the third or fourth time the other day and the entire side seam is split from the bottom of the slipper so I cannot wear them anymore.  I am past the return window through Amazon and am not sure how to contact them directly so think I am out of luck with an exchange or refund.<br /><br />Updated on 8/9:  Seller contacted me to work out an exchange."
3.0,Has a difficult time getting the clasp to work so I sent it back
3.0,"This funny shirt fits great and as expected. I like the image on the front of the shirt and received plenty of comments the one night I wore it out to the bar. The screen print or image on this shirt is very thick and should hold up for a while, but also takes a little getting use to all the solid screen print on the front of a shirt. It will be interesting to see how long it will continue to look good without cracking or peeling like most screen printed shirts will do over time. I received this shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,It’s funny that some people said that it was too tight. Ours was way too big. My husband has a beard and it would not stay up on even his face and it does not have ear holes. Would be great if it was smaller. Maybe I should measure ours and it was not made correctly. I have to rubber band the back of it to hold it together so it will stay up on our faces. Other than the size it’s very comfortable and nice material.
3.0,"Love these earrings, but they aren't very sturdy.  They fall out easily and you have to really make sure they're tight.  if you put on a shirt or sweatshirt they will fall out, just be careful.  Super cute tho!"
3.0,size ran really larger then a baby this age wears...put away for a much later time but the shoes are just as I hoped in the way of quality.
3.0,Disappointed in the hassle it's very thin. Beads are 1 solid color nothing like the picture the spacer beads are different also but pretty color.
3.0,The picture for the hat shows the logo directly on the hat. It’s actually a patch they just sew on a black hat. Doesn’t look very nice.
3.0,I knew the dress would be short but I didn’t expect it to only go down to my hips.
3.0,Order at least a size up as it runs small and is also clingy.
3.0,"They are cute and a good buy for the price, but they are WAY smaller than the size claims."
3.0,"It was a nice necklace, but the stone was a bit small for me to layer with the other necklace I had in mind."
3.0,Not as “wide” calf as my calf
3.0,Not exactly what I'm looking for. It's such a see-through. It's also one size so you can't expect it to fit...
3.0,It is all one bracelet with one clasp.
3.0,chain is too small
3.0,Beautiful but a bit smaller than I thought it would be after reading the size. Can wear to work on a Friday or a more casual jeans vibe.
3.0,My 4 year old has already broken the arm of these (at the hinge) after just two weeks of use. Did not hold up as I’d hoped. They’re super cute though!
3.0,"Not for my body type, I guess. Fit fine on the bottom but loose on the top. I have to give it away."
3.0,It fits a little larger than I expected.  The fabric is nice though not too expensive.  It has a good amount of stretch to it.  The keyhole add some visual interest without really showing cleavage.  It is a good style for working in a professional environment.  Looks great paired with some black heels
3.0,I wear a 6 1/2 but should have went up a half size bigger they're tight around the front
3.0,Not fit to size. Cute shirt though.
3.0,its actually bigger than expected
3.0,"Fabric feels cheap; does not feel like one of those nicer workout shirts you buy from a larger name brand. It fits well, though and maybe I'll use it. The material is thick and it does feel like it will be durable.<br /><br />Somehow I was hoping for something a little more high quality."
3.0,This is a nice watch ...the face is a little of the lighter side (not as solid as prefered) ... only issue I had was the battery came separate from the watch...had to take it to a jewelry store to have it place.
3.0,I ordered a 2xl so the shirt would be really loose and long....it was neither! The shirt fits like a 10 at best. A2xl should fit like a size 20 or 22.NOPE. Also the shirt barely came to my natural waist. I wanted a shirt to wear with leggings. This shirt fit skin tight and almost a crop top.<br />Otherwise the shirt was nice material. Would have been a fun shirt for fall holidays but fits way too small.
3.0,They did have scratches on them when I got them
3.0,Really cute;  but will stretch your ears a little.
3.0,"The glasses are fine, and will serve their purpose. I wasn't prepared for how significantly the hinges would interfere with line of sight - since there are no frames. I assume it's just something I'll get used to and soon won't even notice."
3.0,Like the style but it runs too big. Had to return.
3.0,I am a 5’8” man weighing 210 lbs. This costume just fit. If I pull arms together in front of my body the Velcro in back pops open. The costume left no room to wear a tshirt underneath. I returned it but if I wasn’t overweight it would have definitely fit and I would have kept it.
3.0,Not the best watch band and it comes in cellophane sleeve with no box..
3.0,I have been using a name brand with no problems. This brand frayed up in a short amount of time.
3.0,4 washes and they are falling apart
3.0,Like Em
3.0,"Cute, but very big ... I recommend ordering one size less than what you usually wear!"
3.0,It was just okay- returned for something less large for my kids to put in gym uniform
3.0,"Bought these thinking that they are good for very sunny days, I was wrong. I can’t see while I’m driving, LITERALLY ‘extremely dark’ sunglasses. I don’t know why anyone would need these"
3.0,For the price it is not worth it.
3.0,Not very comfortable but block sunlight well
3.0,THESE ARE REALLY CUTE BUT ORDER A SIZE LARGER. IT DID NOT FIT ON HER FEET WITH SOCKS. ORDERED THE NEXT SIZE AND WAITING ON DELIVERY.
3.0,I bought this for my daughter who is into Goth and it's perfect size for a woman.  My one complaint would be that it's very hard to set the time.  She loves it and already had a chain from another watch that she used with it and since she wears jeans it fits perfectly in her pocket.
3.0,Cute purse but purple is lighter than the picture☹️.
3.0,"Cute dress for the price but wish it was a bit longer. For reference, I'm 5'1&#34; and it hits about 2-3&#34; above the knee. Just upto the knee even would have been great."
3.0,It fits perfect and came right on time with two-day shipping. It looked perfect when I got it but after only four days I noticed that the bottom jewel had lost almost all of the blue to it... Like it just faded to a clear gem (as pictured). It still looks nice but I would prefer it to be blue.
3.0,I had previously bought this in a different shade and loved them. The cat eye shape is not as bold as I'd hoped and also the material is not as sturdy as the other glasses I'd previously bought.
3.0,The overall lenght was perfect.<br />I'm 5'8 and it covered my fanny.<br />I would have given it a higher rating if the sleeves were even. One was just right covering my wrist. The other was too short. I didn't reorder for fear I would have the same problem.
3.0,When I finally got this after Christmas (even though they said 12/12!!) it fit my daughter as expected but she couldn’t wear it for Christmas like she wanted.
3.0,I really thought this beanie was cute. Unfortunately it’s too small. Definitely not meant for an adult. Would fit a child better.
3.0,Look very cheap very disappointed ☹️
3.0,"i wore them once and they ripped , very cute . you get what you pay for."
3.0,"This is a very cool product, but its uses are somewhat more limited then advertised. I bought these to store several small display pieces including coins, pendants etc. They work amazingly for coins & thinner pendents & I recommend them for that. But if your items are bulkier or have edges their are limits.  Bulky items deform the plastic in unattractive ways so your items look vacuum sealed & I had one triangular piece that is pretty thin but did cut into & leave permanent impressions in the plastic at its points."
3.0,Just not what expected very thin material!
3.0,These will jazz up an average everyday outfit but that's about it. My younger teen family members seem to love them while my older ones said they would only wear them with certain outfits. I like them and they are comfortable to wear.
3.0,Easy to take off<br />Harder to fasten if it’s tight
3.0,After washing the string was gone and the waist was messed up. The collar of the waist I guess. Felt like something cheap inside was holding it together.
3.0,I have ordered these before 7 was perfect these are a bit smaller.
3.0,What I was expecting was a choker necklace.the name of the product states that it would be a choker necklace. What I received was a necklace whose length was right below my chest. I still wear the necklace all the time and I do think it's very pretty. I just had my heart set on a certain style and it was not what I ordered.
3.0,It's a good item for the price. The sizing runs a touch small (I normally wear a 7 on my left ring finger but needed a 7.5 in this). It's more narrow than the picture represents. The edges of the interior of the ring are beveled so it's very comfortable. The pattern isn't exactly camo but it's good enough to pass on glancing.
3.0,"I love it but when I ordered two I didn't expect to get two white houses with two white birds. I love white though so it's cool; however, the tape on the back doesn't work.  When I peeled it away to hang on the wall, no good.  It's not even sticky! :("
3.0,"These were really pretty, had a great size, and seems to be a cool organization - but they made my ears itch! Had to return them."
3.0,"I’m on the taller side 5’8”, felt it was too small for taller people."
3.0,"Other reviewers said it was tight, and they were not wrong. This is for people with very small heads. I have a very small head, and even so, it's a little tight. But it has great coverage and you can drive in it, which is what I needed. It stays in the car and I have great protection whenever.<br /><br />*Bonus points for anyone who gets the Breaking Bad reference."
3.0,I just wore a pair i'd bought last year.<br />My hands were FREEZING in 35 degree weather.<br />1.  Material is thin<br />2.  Cold air cuts into spaces in the stitching<br />3.  I have my doubts that this is 100% wool.<br />They would be good under wool mittens or gloves<br />to add extra warmth.
3.0,"Used this for WDW, its ok but kept sliding off but made it work"
3.0,The material could’ve been better along with the fact that the shipping process took far too long to arrive since it arrived almost to a month after I ordered it. I had to get 2 sizes larger I was originally planning to get a small and got the large instead watch video to understand what I mean
3.0,"I have an 8""/21cm wrist so I always look at the lengths of watch bands since the normal 75-120mm bands just don't give me enough band to put in a keeper.<br />This band was said to be 27.5cm.  That is usually enough length although I prefer 280mm if I can find it.<br />This band measured 27.5 overall instead of 27.5cm strap length, which is usual way to call out a strap length.<br />Overall it will do but it is a little short, for me."
3.0,These are extremely high rise and the material is kind of odd feeling but they don't fall down while you workout. Probably won't purchase anymore.
3.0,"I don't want to come down too hard on this product, it's pretty good. The problem is the elastic head band is way to small for me. I only had it on a few minutes and it gave me a splitting headache. I managed to cut the elastic and sew on a couple of Velcro straps. I can at least use it now when I go camping. It's kinda fun really."
3.0,"Embroidery is ok, not a very well constructed cap kinda flimsy and weak, but I’m making it work, haven’t seen any other embroidered Tupac caps on Amazon so this will do….  for Now"
3.0,"This looks cool in the picture. It also arrived very late. The picture shows it in charcoal grey. It is actually closer to black. It becomes a &#34;contraption&#34; when trying it on and I have yet to get it to look like it does on the mannequin. I have had it since December and it is in the closet, never worn."
3.0,"Although the power (2X) is correct and the style is nice, they're kind of small for my face. They'd make a pair of great back up glasses though."
3.0,I hate the way these hang. They do not hang from your ears the way the picture shows. They don’t look anything like the pictures when you put them on. I’m very disappointed
3.0,Very cute bag but not big enough for all the stuff I drag around with me
3.0,Kinda mediocre
3.0,The fabric is tissue thin. I have not yet worn it but it's fine for the $$
3.0,"I would take a picture but the dress is see through. You can see all my lumps and bumps and underwear so it's not the most flattering dress. But the material is the nicest of all 6 dresses that I bought! Even though this has less cotton (65%) than my other dress with 95% cotton, this feels more breathable and soft but less stretchy. But it's just too see through so I'm returning it."
3.0,"This wallet is super cute but the photo made me thing it was a smaller clutch wallet, it's not. It's massive. I wanted something that could fit in my pocket and this is not it. But it is cute, so I'll see if I can make the size work for me. This is great if you need a wallet to keep a lot of stuff, especially a checkbook. Also there is no transparent ID sleeve."
3.0,"So I like how it looks, the fabric is meh to me when I wear it, but most important thing I do not like is the hood is bad due to the fact when you wear it, you will see it's a pointed hood and looks bad on your head unless your style is more akin to white supremacy attire."
3.0,wider than I expected
3.0,The tree was put on backwards so the flat edge is facing outwards and the nice curves are towards my wrist
3.0,"loved the shirt, if you need a large, order XXL"
3.0,I like this shirt but it does run pretty small
3.0,"Really cute shoe, however it will only fit well on a foot with a boxy toe. These shoes have wide, squared off toes with no tapering.  A normal childs foot easily slides forward into the toe box which makes the shoe flip flop off the heel. That makes the shoe too big in the normal childs size.  If this shoe was tapered in the toe, more like feet, it would fit better."
3.0,"Threads came out too easy...I've only had it a month or so and already had to replace it, but what more can you expect from such an inexpensive item."
3.0,"I like some high necklines, but this one was uncomfortably high on me. It was also more fitted than I wanted through the chest. Fabric was nice and light and a pretty color."
3.0,"I had a Tummy Tuck and Lipo.  I needed a really tight garment for my body.  The material is perfect for my body.  I love this garment but...the only problem is that the straps hurt my shoulders.  I already have one line on each shoulder from the pain this causes.  Also, my butt is too big for this.  I ordered a medium and it's a perfect size for my stomach.  I love that it is so comfortable and tight.  You can't tell I'm wearing anything underneath.  I need a tighter garment and I would order a small one but unfortunately my butt won't fit in it.  If the company made these garments smaller from the waist and bigger from the butt, It would be perfect for women after cosmetic procedures...I would definitely keep buying them."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:b632ce4b9b0f75612b62a40b09dc7f18]] I want to live this too but the side boob action irritates the crap out of me 😫 other than that it’s perfect!! Super soft super sexy but at the same time can be classy too!  I’m gonna try to get some double sided tape do see if it helps the situation
3.0,"Over all it is nice.  Looks good, but not as large as I thought it would be.  The top zipper popped, but re-zipped back into place.  If it happens again, I won't continue to use it as I do not want to risk anything falling out."
3.0,Super soft and comfy but alot longer than expected
3.0,bought as a gift.  Can't rate comfort and support.  Star rating could be five but have incomplete information.
3.0,I like the look of this mask however I did have some difficulty with it. The straps are thick and didnt fit without the plastic pieces around them which are large and made it uncomfortable. It does allow me to breathe better than others because it is more open at the top.
3.0,Some crystals were missing on a few of the bands upon opening the bracelet.
3.0,"Thought they'd look more like real gears,not so fake looking"
3.0,"The earrings were NOT dinosaurs at all of any kind. The ones pictured are of t-rex dinosaurs...i ended up with ""Alien"" earrings. They are cool BUT not what I ordered."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings on this dress. The dress is overall well made. It was a true, deep, blue black, not a red black (which I feel is not as rich). The material felt nice on my skin, no irritation from the seems or lace. The sleeves were the perfect length, and due to the cut and angle, I believe that would hold true for long or short arms. The length of the skirt brushed the tops of my feet, so I would not put any kind of hoop skirt with it, as you would lose even more length. However, the corseted top was quite awkward; perhaps that's because I am top heavy. The lace trim and the laces of the corset did not flow together, with the lace trim bunching up and the lacing of the corset sitting above the lace trim. Also, the side of the corset barely even covered the side of my bust. It was quite snug. I took my measurements, both in inches and in centimeters, and according to the sizing guidelines that was provided, due to my bust, I needed a xxl. However, when it arrived I found another size up would have been much better. The chest was quite tight and the shoulders were snug as well, making moving my arms difficult. I am 5'5"" and generally wear an xl top and a 38DD bra for size references. I wish this would have fit better, but I ultimately had to return it. For someone not as busty, I imagine this would be perfect. Definitely recommend sizing up 1 maybe even 2 sizes."
3.0,"GOOD PRODUCT, BAD FIT, MADE FOR TINY ARMS..."
3.0,"I choose the size according to the description, but turned out to be larger than necessary."
3.0,It is just ok. Kind of skimpy with size and fur
3.0,"Although they’re hearty and durable, the design is backwards as if it’s for a left handed person. If was backwards from my original band. I wish I knew this prior to purchase"
3.0,The small was just too small so returned it and there weren't any larger sizes available.  Would have bought a medium cause it's fierce and cute.  Will keep checking if there are larger sizes available cause I'm in love with this brand!  Fall 2018 and I've bought a lot of CRZ Yoga stuff recently.
3.0,Fit was a bit small and it took forever to arrive.
3.0,"I am not fat ordered the right size, shoulders are ok however the shirt is very long!"
3.0,Did not receive these.  I received thee pair of silver earrings instead. I will return them if I receive a pair of the gold tone earrings.
3.0,only for one time use.
3.0,"I'm 155lb, 5'5"", 34DD. I tried the medium and large.  The perfect size would have been somewhere right in the middle - the large fit better around my ribcage but was lower on my chest which I wasn't a fan of. I'm electing go with the medium and just stretch out the bra area in the back so it clings a tiny bit less.  It's basically thick t-shirt material, so you can sort of do a little creative stretching as needed. Flattering, too - flares out (though less than the photo shows) just above the tummy area.  The blackish green is a nice dark teal."
3.0,"Very pretty bracelet I purchased to complete an outfit for a wedding. Unfortunately the snap disconnected from the bracelet as soon as I pulled it out of the package to try it on. Will try gluing it and if that doesn't work, guess it goes in the trash. :/"
3.0,"Looks great, however, it didn't make it through an entire night before two of the clips on the back broke off. It is plastic so no easy way to reattach."
3.0,"I ordered this sequin bodysuit romper in size 12 months so my little one could wear it on her first birthday, or for pictures for her first birthday. The reviews I read stated this outfit fits as expected, but in my case it probably won't make it until her first birthday. It fits somewhat small for us."
3.0,Looks better in the photo. Runs big too. Obviously not an official item. Shirt material was very heavy and uncomfortable.
3.0,Skirt is very short.
3.0,Ran small in size
3.0,The fit was snug on me. It comes in plastic bag so it smells like plastic. So i gave it to my mom. Happy Mothers Day!
3.0,It's a nice dress and the fabric is not see-through but it just wasn't right for me.  It's very big and drapes to the floor.
3.0,Wasn't the dress I wanted. Same but not the pattern
3.0,"I don't like the material, not synthetic!!"
3.0,"Clunky, my kid did not like them"
3.0,I did not pay attention to fabric type. I wear it
3.0,"First of all, 3 stars is not a bad review.  This is a decent watch band.  It looks sharp.  Some people complained about the pin coming loose, so I used the pin from my old band and have had no problem.  The not so good part is that it closes with a kind of button cog and then the end tucks under the rest of the band.  While this looks nice, it is much harder to take on and off than a traditional buckle.  Also I bought a red and black and it is really orange and black."
3.0,I ordered M I'm skinny 130 pounds 5'4 tall it fit me ok but I think is to loose I don't see any shape with this shirt. The material it's ok for the price.
3.0,"It's cute, although the black print on the purple shirt is way too dark and difficult to see. I'd return it except I don't want to pay the return shipping fee."
3.0,"Fits well, however it is thinner then the original that came with the wallet. I have been using the hipster from ROLF for many years and the only week point are the inserts. Only time will tell if this is stronger then the originals but at first glance I have my doubts."
3.0,Very soft and cozy but runs big I ordered a 7 which I usually wear and they were huge....I’m contemplating getting them a bit smaller as they are very comfortable to wear to work on the weekends and I get so much compliments on them even tho I have to wear socks to kind of fill up the extra space
3.0,"These are okay. The wooden beads are nice and light and on a stretchy band for wearing as a bracelet, however they do not hold a candle to real stones or even high quality sandalwood mala necklaces. I got the variety pack and they are all differing lengths, mostly much smaller than my traditional necklaces, and they all wrap differently on my wrist (a couple too tight, a couple too loose, a couple just right). They will work great for traveling, though, as I'm not as concerned about damage or theft as I would be for my other malas."
3.0,"When I had the zipper in the middle of my back, the drawstring part of the skirt wasn’t as in the photo, but instead on my side. Cute , but not the most breathable or comfortable material. Bought for a game day outfit but don’t think it’ll be the best for walking around in the heat all day, would be better for an indoor event with minimal walking if you want a more body-con fit."
3.0,The case didn't really fit my daughters phone. It's for her iPhone 6 and it was a little loose.
3.0,The ruse was to shallow for me. Fit was uncomfortable. Fabric to heavy
3.0,I want to give these 5 stars because I really do like them but I've had them for about a week and the silver ones already broke. :( I purchased the 12mm models. I would say if you need some spares they are alright but I wouldn't trust them for long term wear unfortunately.
3.0,They were really nice and a decent size. But after having them for about a month they were all gone because they were so small they slipped right out of my nose.
3.0,Good fit - socks are somewhat thin. Vibrant colors
3.0,I ordered a 2x and should have ordered a size bigger being its snug around the breast area .
3.0,Not the right shirt. I got a shirt with Eliot mixing drinks and it says I may be drunk but I’m entirely reliable. I like the shirt I got and think it’s funny.
3.0,Shorts were very nice but too large. I would recommend 1 size down.
3.0,"I ordered and received the E Camo in 36, and they fit my husband great.  He likes them and says the fit is good and they are comfortable.  In my opinion they also look good on him.<br /><br />These shorts are a nice dark subtle camo print, and the fabric is medium weight.  It’s a smooth woven denim fabric, no stretch as with standard all cotton jeans, and fabric does not feel like it is brushed or peached.  Most of the shorts’ seams are double-stitched (or overlock).  There is a functional drawstring inside the waist so you can tighten the waist if desired.  There are also drawstrings at the bottom of the legs at the side seam as shown in my photos.  These are not anything my husband will be using so he went ahead and removed them.  They were simple to remove.<br /><br />The shorts have a zipper front, the zipper is not YKK but works well, and the waist has a button close. The waist button is not a standard metal jean button, but rather a plastic sewn button.  The button sewing isn’t the greatest and I can see where the button will not last long if I just leave it, so I am going to do a quick sewing job and reinforce the button.  There are 6 belt loops the waist, and a total of 6 pockets.  The 2 front pockets are nice and deep, the 2 side cargo pockets and 2 back pockets all have a button close plus a flap. I was a little annoyed to find the seam finishing inside one of the cargo shorts was kind of a chaotic mess.  (see photo)  I can cut all these excess threads off, but…. a garment that is well-constructed would not have this.<br /><br />Last, I like to include actual measurements of clothing I review. I use a standard sewing tape and lay the garment on a flat surface.  Here are my findings for these (36W) shorts:<br /><br />Waist: 18.5” / 37”<br />Front rise: 13.25”<br />Inseam: 10.75”<br />Leg opening: 11:25” / 22.5”<br /><br />My final thoughts: These are nice looking shorts that fit him well, but there were some construction issues with these shorts. They are things I can fix in a short period of time, but clothing that is well-constructed would not have messy finishing or weak stitching when it is new and not yet experienced any wear."
3.0,"This product came dirty, as in dirty on the bottom of the cup. There was also a chip/scratch on the mug. We had just taken it out of the box, but it was damaged. Not a fan. Would not purchase again."
3.0,Beautiful fitted jacket and very stylish.  Unfortunately not warm at all. 100% polyester.
3.0,"These shoes are super cute. Two issues are that they scuff really easily and have super hard soles. If they weren't heeled, it would have been okay for me, but because they are raised, it puts a lot of pressure on the balls and toes of my feet. I wore them out for a few hours ( constantly walking) and I have small blisters. I might just put a gel sole in to make them wearable because they were really nice shoes other than that."
3.0,"Loose fitting dress, no waist line and not flattering.  Purchased large and it is too big."
3.0,Fits smaller then thought. Too thin of material to be labeled as anything compression.
3.0,I rate it a 3. The clasp to connect it is so hard to connect. It hurts trying to open the clasp. But other than that its super cute!
3.0,"The fit is as expected, based on the measurements in the description, but the dress was shorter in length than what was in the detailed description of the dress, and at 5'4&#34; it came up to mid-calf for me.  I would have kept the dress had it been the length as described, but unfortunately, I had to return it.  A very nice, comfortable dress though."
3.0,I had to return it for a replacement after 1 wash because one of the buttons snapped. I wouldn't have noticed until  my baby rubbed her face on my chest and cut her face. Just got the replacement. Will update.
3.0,This top runs true to size maybe a little bigger. You do need to wear a cami under it.
3.0,"The earrings I received look like they have been sitting in someone's jewelry box for about 20 years. They are VERY tarnished and used looking. They mostly cleaned up okay but the large black spot on the tip of one of the post spirals actually wont come off completely. I will try and clean them again with liquid silver cleaner as I only have a silver cleaning cloth and I’m sure it will come off but honestly, I shouldn’t have to put this much work into something that’s supposed to be brand new... I am very disappointed."
3.0,This bag is so cute. Works perfectly as a downsize for our diaper bag. I wanted to get back a sense of my style as I feel like motherhood sucked me in.<br />However... The smell! What in the world?! I once had a Boston butt go bad and didn't notice it and left it to cook all day in the oven. The smell I came home to is exactly what this bag smells like. Why????<br />I will come back and change this to 5 stars if it ever dissipates but it's been a week or two and still at full rotten meat status
3.0,These ripped in multiple spots after a couple weeks of use.
3.0,"Not what I was expecting, it was thicker then I wanted but it is too pretty to send back! Lol"
3.0,I was so excited to get new undershirts. I opened the bag only to find one of them are ripped! 3 stars because the other ones are okay and very confortable.
3.0,My son only got to wear these four times. He never complained.
3.0,this dress runs very large. buy a size down
3.0,"The bras fit appropriately and are comfortable, but buyer beware--these items have to be washed gingerly. Every single bra is curling out at the upper edge of the cup after ONE wash. I'm having to manually sew the edges to make them wearable. I don't think I'll be buying these again."
3.0,It srunk after 1st washing and the colors ran. Not as pretty as 1st purchased. A total mess.
3.0,"My wife likes it, looks shiny and nice but I am giving 3 stars cause 2 of the crystals few"
3.0,"These are nice gloves, they are very snug fitting. I bought these for my 19 year old son to go along with the STOCKTON DRIVING CLASSIC Leather Ivy Unique Caps Hat. He told me just the other day that he noticed when he took them off that black was on his hands and under his nails. Not sure if he just wore them too long or what but for a lamb leather I wasn't expecting that... so I may send them back."
3.0,The gloves did not keep my hands warm after 7 minutes in the cold
3.0,"The crown glass is flat, and the works mount too close to the glass.  That causes the second hand to stick against the glass, which is why others have reported it doesn't keep time.  I opened it up & removed the second hand ; it's been running fine ever since that."
3.0,Very thin fabric with a strange odor that might have come out with washing. I followed the sizing instructions but the shirt was far too large.
3.0,"I like this top, but it isn't the best.  The material is very clingy material and because it runs a little small, it isn't the most flattering on someone like me with a little extra weight.  The fabric is soft and very comfortable, the color is great as I expected.  I would possibly order again, but I would probably go up two sizes."
3.0,Nice belt but VERY wide/fat better worn with jeans than pants IMO<br /><br />***
3.0,"This robe is fine.  It's a little small for me but not obscenely.  I would just have preferred a little more material.  And the material is not particularly soft and is also thin - it feels almost disposable or something that someone might find at a clinic.  Still, it does the job."
3.0,Had a hole in the sleeve. Fixed it myself:(
3.0,"Bottoms can fit a small, but top cannot fit a 32 or 34 band. Very loose. I can see the top accommodating an A-D cup, but could possible fit larger than that as well. This is not made for tiny people."
3.0,I was surprised to find them too large for me! They won't stay up and one of them is already coming apart.
3.0,Ordered a size larger than I normally take but was too small. Nice skirt. Unfortunately you didn't carry a larger size. Returned.
3.0,The material is great.  They are just too small. They dont go up high enough on my waist which would not allow enough movement to workout or do yoga.  Which was their purpose. I gave them to someone smaller and they like them. I sized up and they still didn't fit.
3.0,Too small for head. Gave away to a young girl.
3.0,"Pros:<br /><br />The color was as pictured and it fit as expected.<br /><br />The waffle texture and twist knot are pretty and give the shirt a nice look.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The material is VERY rough and stiff. Even after a wash and dry, the shirt I had didn't soften up much. I don't know if it is just the product I received, or if every shirt will be this way.<br /><br />Due to the stiff nature of the material, the neckline can sit a little odd.<br /><br />It looks nice with leggings or yoga pants, but with anything that had a buckle or zipper - it bunched up and added a lot of volume around the midsection. I'm 5'7"" and 120 lbs and even with skinny jeans I looked like I had added 10lbs to my waist."
3.0,"Three stars because I love the quality and print... however. WAY TOO SMALL. I know it says they run small, but that’s no joke. I normally wear a 6 in everything and ordered an 8. Not even close to being able to button or zip. Currently returning them. I am hesitant on ordering a 10 because I don’t even know if those will fit with how tiny the 8s were. Bummer"
3.0,The necklace is a good buy and it looks even better in person. The colors of the pendent is dark colors it shows the craftsmanship better
3.0,This came from China and is way too small for a 2XL
3.0,Bows came loose..
3.0,This was obviously used
3.0,Product needs to be more sturdy. Bends easily
3.0,"These smell bad. It's not over powering, but even letting them air out didn't help, so I filed for a refund. My youngest son is starting kindergarten this year, so I needed to find him some masks. He is autistic, so the sensory aspects of the mask are important. He liked how they fit and they were soft. But the smell was too much for him. I tried them myself and while obviously too small, I could smell it too. I'm sad that these didn't work out for him, they are really cute."
3.0,"Cute but they stay on, Velcro is very weak"
3.0,"Well made product. We purchased hoping to eliminate stress on the ears from the facemask straps. Due to these straps being so thin like a rubber band, they still create some fatigue. My only suggestion would be to make the straps wider."
3.0,"For the price, these are a good deal. I essentially paid like $3 for each piece.  Something I did not expect, though, was for the ear warmers not to be just a thick piece of fleece. They have a foam-ish layer with fleece covering it. Not ideal, but not terrible. Also, don't let the velcro catch on the edging because it will stick and snag horribly. The small gloves arr a little baggy on my women's small hands, but they keep the chill off while exercising outdoors in winter. Overall, I'd recommend."
3.0,"It really is beautiful, however it was to tight around my bust 34DD."
3.0,"I love these, they fit well, and look good. But the seams are coming apart the second time I am wearing them. I am going to try to exchange them and see if it was just a bad batch."
3.0,"It was not as shown in the photo.  Colors were dark, not colorful as the photo.  I was expecting a sweatshirt but it was a long sleeved t-shirt."
3.0,This was big even for me.
3.0,Was expecting a little more than dollar store sunglasses.
3.0,"Could of been really cute, but it looks like a sheet on me. Probably won’t ever wear it. :("
3.0,"Love this coat but after a week of wearing it I found a hole on the inside of the hood and where the drawstrings are. Very sad, but still wearing it. For the price it’s still worth it!<br />For being a lightweight coat, it is still very warm. Great coat for Wisconsin winters!"
3.0,This thing is a tent! It’s a cute color but not what I expected
3.0,"Fits ok, was too small."
3.0,Smaller than expected and poor quality material
3.0,Good watch but stopwatch function only goes up to 1hr and dual time feature is better set to be the same time as they're not clearly distinguished
3.0,"My baby is 18 months n wears a 61/2 so I decided after reading the reviews to buy him an 6 because they run big but once I got them they were huge, super cute love the style but way to big. So I brought another pair in a 5 n still to big. Just going to have to wait until he can wear them. The price is good just trying to figure out what size to get that would fit your child is the difficult part."
3.0,"Smaller than expected, mostly in the length, and I don't like the patch front and center.  I hope it doesn't shrink or it will be too small."
3.0,"The outfit is not stretchy an it runs small, I usually wear a medium an I could barely get in it"
3.0,its worth the $1.45 it cost
3.0,The quality appears to be good but unfortunately they apparently run about one size smaller than I expected so I'll be exchanging them.
3.0,It is hard to get used to. I tried.
3.0,"It's ok, but not flattering and runs big.  Good for just around the house."
3.0,"the leather too thin, it looked nice and more like a dress boot but it wasn't what I was looking for"
3.0,"For the time this watch works, it’s wonderful. It doesn’t last long though. There are replaceable batteries, but that didn’t revive it. It seems to just crap out after a year or so of use. It’s cheap enough that you can replace it, but don’t buy this thinking it’ll be your 5 year watch. We’re on the third one and it’s still one of the easiest to use.  Just wish it lasted longer!"
3.0,"Coat has cute style....size recommendations were good. Problem is coat has no fabric content tag. Dry cleaners will only press. Coat cannot be dry cleaned, so will probably be returning."
3.0,"Shoe is easy to put on. However, there is a strap that does nothing. Shoe can not be tightened which is disappointing especially when my son is playing in water. It would be nice to secure the shoe a little more to his foot."
3.0,"Heres the deal.<br /><br />To buy something at this price point and hold it to the same standards as glasses that cost 10-100 times as much - Ridiculous, Unfair & Irrational.<br /><br />You have to consider the cost and thats why any competent reviewer will have different classes such as &#34;Budget&#34; & &#34;Enthusiast&#34;.<br />Its EXTREMELY RARE for a Budget item to match the quality / performance of Enthusiast (or high end) Items.<br /><br />With that said.<br /><br />Immediately upon touching these i felt they felt kind of cheap, i hate speculating but i feel these wont last for say 3-4 years unless they are &#34;babied&#34; but i could be wrong, they might end up lasting longer than i do - its possible.<br /><br />I wanted a pair that didnt make me look like i just came from the sunglasses section at the dollar store.<br />I wanted them to look somewhat decent & would take a slight hit in quality to obtain that.<br />I like the idea of being able to change out the lens depending on the weather/activity or perhaps to match with what im wearing, to me thats a huge plus<br /><br />But<br /><br />Because of what i mentioned earlier i feel the more i change the lens the more prone these glasses are to breaking, the build of these glasses although they look &#34;sporty&#34; = not very durable feeling.<br /><br />These glasses in my honest opinion are a decent value for what it offers.<br />The case adds to that value. (case impressed me the most actually, sturdy little guy)<br /><br />The interesting part:<br /><br />Would i recommend these if it were just the glasses? No case etc?<br /><br />No i wouldnt.<br /><br />Do i recommend them overall?<br /><br />It doesnt matter because whats important here is your expectations, what you are looking to get out of these?<br /><br />Durable glasses that will be good for high energy sports/activities? - No<br /><br />Glasses that offer the look of those &#34;other&#34; brands at a fraction of the cost - Yes<br /><br />Dont have much of a budget but dont want your sunglasses to symbolize that fact to everyone around you? 15-20 ft Any closer people will notice you bought &#34;cheapos&#34;.<br />20-30 feet to someone who knows their fashion/brands.<br /><br />You dont give a crap about what people think, want a pair of versatile glasses that comes with a nice kit for the cost? - Yes"
3.0,the arm warmer elbow gloves are very nice...  but I am a big girl and they are tight on me.... after being worn for 1 hour the thumb holes were starting to make an indention on my hands and I had to remove them....  If you don't have chubby arms I think they would be wonderful...  MAKE some larger &#34;around&#34; and I will buy them again......<br />Diane
3.0,I did not put 5 stars on the above Nude shoulder pad i gave it a 3 star.  They do not stay on with the velour strap like they should.  Disappointed for sure.  Would not recommend.
3.0,Got it for me and my little sister so we could have matching Crocs charms but broke off the black thing with in 2 days not worth it I know it’s cheap just I thought it would have been better
3.0,I’d really love this sweatshirt if it didn’t arrive with a hole in it!!
3.0,Not as flattering on as anticipated but still a cute dress nonetheless!
3.0,I like the material and how well it fits to form. I just wish u would have gotten them in black instead!
3.0,Like the quality of the material and the fit. One negative is that the pants came with the front torn.
3.0,Comfy but they run big
3.0,Colors are nice but feels cheap
3.0,"I got them to use as shower shoes at the gym.  They are too small for every day wear, but work just fine for a quick shower after working out."
3.0,"Great glasses,  except for the bifocals are to low. They need to be a little higher so you don't have to lift them up to read."
3.0,"If you are expecting a warmish cardigan, I would look elsewhere. This top is very thin, likely cotton, not warm at all, and not a sweater. I will be keeping it because it is still a nice garment, but I was expecting something totally different when ordering."
3.0,Larger than expected. Ended up returning them. Nice earrings though.
3.0,The embroided is amazing! super cute ..but the fabric quality it’s not good..no cotton at all. It’s a stiff and hot material
3.0,their really cute but the just broke DON'T FALL FOR THEM!!!
3.0,"Easy to use , less mess other bathroom floor"
3.0,Litte over sized. Makes a good cover up
3.0,Not what I expected top is way too big for the size bottom that it came with
3.0,I really didn’t like the material is was kinda stiff and rough in a way. Like wasn’t really stretchy
3.0,"I really wanted to love these. I actually do love them, when they aren't in my ears.<br />These are incredibly hard to get in. I had to bend them. Then, once you do the stones get ""top heavy"" and continuously fall down the lobe so you have to keep adjusting them all day.<br />Not a fan."
3.0,I liked the print but not the fabric!
3.0,Did like the material - and the stiches was shown and hidden. I would not recommend any one to buy this product.
3.0,"Cute shirt but the legnth is really short.  I ordered a large, then an extra large and both are the same legnth. Just wider around."
3.0,"The hat is nice,the logo is printed and looks exactly like the picture but it looks cheap on the back. Not bad for the price but don't expect it to look expensive. Overall it's okay."
3.0,"Nice case, but not the exact vibrant colors"
3.0,"Really cute top, but the lace part at top actually fades after only a couple washes. So it's starting to look tacky now and I'll probably end up donating it to goodwill. But I got a few good wears out of it. The shirt is nice quality and very comfortable."
3.0,Shorter than expected but it's cool
3.0,"It's rest cute,  but if you have a bigger chest get a bigger size"
3.0,"too snug for me, these are not US sizes."
3.0,I thought the fabric didn't merit the price. Cheap fabric.
3.0,"They wear fast or the edges are just too sharp, hurts the inside of my lip.  If they are too long, it looks stupid, if they are too short it hurts."
3.0,"Very pretty, look awesome! Just not very comfortable. Maybe a little platform will help"
3.0,I ordered and XL in the orange and grey. It's way too small for me unless I was gonna wear it as a body con. I had to give it to my sister who wears a size 6/8 dress. Fits her just like the picture. She's 5'2 and it's a couple inches above her ankles.
3.0,Shirt is good quality and I like the fabric. I ordered a size under my usual and it is still really large. I would not purchase again.
3.0,Some of the little arrow pieces broke off within the first day I had them.
3.0,"These are a great price for what you get, but I really don't understand why you would take sterling silver and paint it black. It kind if defeats the purpose in my opinion."
3.0,It was a different shad of pink. Doesn't flatter most body types. Looks good in a picture but not in person
3.0,"too much lining, i want ed a summer slipper. too hot"
3.0,"This fit great to size, very flattering. V-neck is low as pictured."
3.0,The frames are very flimsy. I feel like I’m going to break them every time I pick them up. They are cute but just not sturdy.
3.0,This dress was alright. Poofier and thicker with 2 layers then i thought. Thpught it was going to be simpler then it was
3.0,It bunches in the back
3.0,This is a nice shirt however the picture is slightly deceiving because the body and hem of the shirt is not as flowing as depicted.  I thought it would be roomier in that area to cover my larger tummy and booty but unfortunately it was too snug.  Overall I like the silhouette of the shirt however it just wasn't for me.
3.0,The 2x fit more like a Large.<br />The seller was responsive to remedy.
3.0,Too small for a bigger face recommended for people who has smaller face and slim face...it’s like a kids sun glasses
3.0,"My daughter who wants cosplay or anything anime LOVES this sweatshirt. I do not because, the quality is so cheap. The fit is weird, definitely just misshapen? Feels more costume like, yet she wears it all the time.I do not see it holding up. And the color isn't very saturated."
3.0,I was loving this wristlet (purchased less that 3 months ago) until the wrist part broke! Hoping I can sew it back. Disappointed in the poor stitching.
3.0,"The material is ok but I got the green color and the shade of green that this dress is does not match the picture at all! It is lighter, more of a lime or olive green. Not dark / army green."
3.0,"I loved this swim suit until I tried it on. The top is not for busty girls. I'm a 36DD at top && 8/M at the bottom. I'm not pleased but, I will keep it and find a swim top that fits me better."
3.0,this is just a quick and cheap bag.. look around before buying this one ..
3.0,Pattern isn't friendly for any with a belly. The design is right in the middle and calls attention
3.0,"Looks nice and fit well, but the shoes only lasted my child a little over a month before the insole area started to break apart. The fabric over the bottom insole is completely peeling off. He did wear them daily over this period of time, but we’ve had other shoes last a lot longer."
3.0,"I made a mistake on first review. I said sizes instead of s,m,l, extra large. I would have ordered extra large. But I cannot zip it closed . I want to return it and I just ordered a new one."
3.0,"Seems to be a great belt if they were to make smaller size, they look very sleek but professional!"
3.0,I really want to give this a 5 star Because it's super cute. But when you get it the package smashed the daylights out of it. And I certainly didn't know how to get the major  creases out of it so it was warm the way it was supposed to be warm without ruining it. So unless you know how to take creases out of a straw hat before warm the packaging could certainly use an upgrade.
3.0,Beautiful dress but it was extremely big for me. Runs big.
3.0,"I bought this without realizing it had a gold-finish. That was my fault and I should have looked closer. I am not a gold or fake-gold fan so I ended up donating this set to Goodwill. To the manufacturer - Could you please make more silver-plated jewelry? These pieces are so gorgeous, it stinks that they are mostly fake-gold."
3.0,Cute but it did NOT come with the pendant.......
3.0,"I struggled with how many stars to rate this product because, technically, it was exactly what I ordered.  The problem is I couldn't get used to wearing these!  No part of the multi-focal was great for me - the reading glass part worked pretty well but trying to wear them full time makes you feel like you're looking through the bottom of a glass bottle!  The mid-upper part is mostly OK but as you move your head around there's just an unsettling blurriness that occurs.<br /><br />All that being said, your mileage may vary with these and your eyes will be perfectly happy.  For me, I experimented with multifocal and failed!"
3.0,The price is good but the color is misrepresented. It was more a plum color than purple.
3.0,I got my typical size but it is extremely large and does not fit me properly it is definitely a bummer purchase. It's not even the kind of material you can a hem so over all I don't think I may be able to use it
3.0,very pretty but runs SUPER small. im a medium top size. ordered a medium. i couldnt even get it over my head. re-ordered in xtra large.
3.0,beautiful dress and gorgeous embroidery -it is fitted with zip in the side but fit runs very very small - if you are tiny get it - wish they made a bigger size
3.0,These socks are truly nonskid and are great.  The only problem is a couple of pairs have started to lose the grips after only a few times wearing them
3.0,"Super cute cut, but REALLY SMALL! I have a large bust and I got an XXlarge and its still too snug around the shoulders! Its a shame because its really nice otherwise. I love the 3/4 sleeves."
3.0,Runs large should size down
3.0,Beautiful band although I am not positive it's authentic. I have purchased several other bands for my Bradshaw access watch from my local Dillards department store and the packaging is slightly different and is not of the same quality. For the price it was worth it in the end to be able to change the band's out. I have attached photos of the packaging from the department store and the packaging received with this band. You be the judge. In the first photi the one on the right is the authentic one in the second photo the one on the left is the authentic one.
3.0,"Bigger than I thought, but still look nice"
3.0,"I absolutely love the quality and fit of this jacket.  The unexpected part was that the jacket was NOT hooded (in a traditional sense) and the jacket that arrived was grey, white and black...not grey, white, and blue like the photo.  I had hope it would have been a nice match to wear with blue jeans, like the way it appears in the photos."
3.0,left shoes  feel more tight ..
3.0,The beanie fits pretty normal it's not too big not to small. The only thing I will say is that I thought the Cadillac emblem was embroidered and it was not. It's just a print of a picture of Cadillac emblem sewn on which makes the beanie look cheap.
3.0,Wrist band needs to be alittle longer barely fits my wrist
3.0,"Cute for awhile, all kinda have fallen apart in the year I've had them."
3.0,"Nice looking braid.  Belt is a little short. I ordered a large and most large should fit as suggested between 36-40 inch waist. I'm between 36-38 and most belts measure 47.5&#34; in total length from top of buckle to tip.  This belt on the right of my photo, measures 45&#34; total. So a little short.  Because it's elastic it will fit but if I gain weight it's going in the box with my &#34;skinny&#34; stuff. LOL."
3.0,"5’ 4 120lbs 24in waist  Fit nice on the legs, but the waist was so big!!! It kinda seemed like someone had already worn them and stretched them out."
3.0,Cheap material was hoping a little nicer and with a little fuller skirt. Fits as expected I’m 5’3” 128  ordered a sm. Not as nice as I would have liked for 20.00 if I were to have bought at Ross would have been no more than 10.00<br />But not wanting to go out with covid except necessities.
3.0,"nice colorful pattern, not so warm as expected, this was a christmas gift and after 2 months of wearing a hole appeared,"
3.0,The shirt was super cute but was too small which was a huge disappointment. Definitely runs small and the material wasn't as comfortable or soft like I was hoping it would be.
3.0,Great Dress for work Sales meeting. I received many compliments. Fit well... only thing is slit in back was a little risky.
3.0,I loved the cut and stretch but the pockets were the best perk. Only negative is the dress faded quite a bit with one wash.
3.0,A little tight and began to &#34;pill&#34; after one wash.
3.0,"Cute, but a little disappointed in size. I know that my granddaughters will like them and it will be a short bit!"
3.0,It’s the right size but no directions to use
3.0,The bust part was way to big
3.0,"these are warm and great, but not for me. After long time use you will have cramps in your calves as the arch support is very high.  I hear like walking on heels i guess. Also, don't get them wet...they warp inside and become useless."
3.0,"This has enough detail on the front that it looks really exciting from about 4 to 5 feet away, but once you get up close, the lack of quality is pretty apparent. I might wear this if I were dressing up in a costume of some manner, but I definitely don't think it's the sort of quality I would choose for a daily statement piece to wear to normal gatherings. I love that it is big and flashy and exciting, and I also love that it is an adjustable size.<br /><br />My husband immediately wanted to repurpose this as a super cool shield for an action figure, which will tell you about the level of quality to expect when ordering. It is flashy and exciting, but does not in any way seem like grown-up jewelry."
3.0,"Unfortunately they are a bit long for my fingers, but I have kind of shot fingers anyways. They are really nice gloves otherwise and I will keep wearing the and try to break them in"
3.0,"I was kind of underwhelmed. I thought it was going to be bigger, and For some reason, I was thought it was just “ok.” Looks better in photo than in person."
3.0,Won’t stay clipped on watch. Connecting rods Seem to be a little short. Very pretty.
3.0,"This is one of my first purchases after losing my hair due to chemo. I liked the bold colors/pattern and the flower as added volume to my bald head. The fabric is thin though, so the little hair I have left often pokes through, and it is not very warm. For those with hair, probably a different story, though I am not sure how you would be able to fit a lot of hair under such a tight fitting hat."
3.0,Cute dress. Too small.
3.0,"It's a cute shirt. The sleeves however are a little weird. They stick out when I put it on. It's also very see through, so highly recommended you wear something underneath it. Overall, it's a cute shirt, just something that I wish I could have tried on before buying."
3.0,"I bought this in an XL, which is my usual size but the dress was huge one me. It was really long and frumpy looking. It reminded me of something that a conservative Amish woman would wear. I can see how this might look cute on a thinner person in a size small but if you need to buy a large or XL to fit your chest and rear into, this will probably not look nice on you. I gave the dress 3 stars because it appears to be very well made and the color was pretty - just not for me."
3.0,"Made of good quality materials. Only problem is one of the snaps won't stay snapped and I only have 3 cards on that side. And no change in zipper area. Case is nice, strong magnet. Holds securely in case."
3.0,"This hat looks ridiculous, but of course you knew that. But, I really need protection from the sun when doing yard work, so bye-bye fashion. This hat does a decent job of protecting from the sun, but it is just so flimsy and doesn't feel like it is going to last a long time. I could be wrong, but this is my initial impression. But I give it three stars because it is not expensive at all. So if it lasts one season, it might just be worth it."
3.0,"I wanted to love these pants. They fit great and were a really cute flattering cut. BUT the way the pattern matched up at the front center seam/crotch area was just ugly. Sending back, sadly."
3.0,I liked the quality but pairs even thougn in the same size were different.
3.0,I like how it was comfortable and texture<br />What I didn't like was it came bended when I received it
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I wasn’t surprised when I had to get an extra large and it was still small. Definitely not a top for anybody who has anything higher than a B sized chest"
3.0,The size isn't even close to being accurate.
3.0,Earrings arrived loose in the box and severely tarnished. Can’t wear them. The necklace was in good shape but seeing as how badly the earrings look I’m doubting the quality.
3.0,These are great value for the price. Only thing is they are pretty malleable so they bend easily when trying to put the backs on them. The back that goes on the earring post is somewhat hard to snap on and the post is extremely long so you definitely can't press a phone against your ear or lay with these in.
3.0,"Can I get a shorter or petite length?<br />Love the feel, love the fit around the waist and thighs, love the look.<br />4 inches to long in the legs.<br />Kind of a bummer.<br /><br />And a button fell off within 2 weeks."
3.0,"Nice shoes, except due to the straps it was kinda hard to put them on."
3.0,Its a little tight for the measurements given.. I have multiple suits this one just is tighter than usual
3.0,Pretty thicc lanyard
3.0,This sports bra runs small!
3.0,"Very cute but too short and tight for my tastes (and I typically wear form fitting clothes).  I’m US 10-12, women’s M-L, with hourglass build and I bought a Large.  Would be cute on someone smaller.  I returned mine."
3.0,Fits more like a crop top
3.0,We are really cute socks but the sizing is not accurate.  I ordered 0-12mo size in the hopes they would work for my daughter this winter (1-4months) and there is no way.  They are definitely for closer to a 1 year old.  Too bad they don’t have a 0-6mo then 6-12mo sizing.  I will keep them for a later date but I’m bummed I can’t use them now.
3.0,"This was supposed to be a men's XL but it was more like a woman's XL. It was short waisted for men's sweater, the arms narrow, the body extra slim. Perhaps it was meant to be boys XL and not men's. Perhaps the manufacturer had a missed communication with the vendor and sent the incorrect size. The quality was so so. The knit was not worsted weight, probably was sport weight or even sock weight. It was made on a knitting machine not hand knit. At any rate it was so thin it would probably provide very little if any insulation under a jacket or parka."
3.0,"the title is ""maxi dress"" but actually is a hi-low maxi dress. I did not wanted the hi-low, but the straight hemmed maxi dress. The hi-low is a different dress.<br />The fabric used is good and has a great flow but I returned the dress as it was not what I had ordered."
3.0,the way this dress flares is not flatering for a short 5'2 person
3.0,Workmanship is fine.  Size is just off.
3.0,Item is way larger than expected. I ordered a small and it fit like a large
3.0,"I purchased this watch because i thought it would be around the same size as the picture of the watch being shown on the wrist made it seem to be a normal size! My wrists aren't even that big but this casio watch is a lot smaller than it would have you seem!<br /><br />In comparison, this casio watch (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AWZDA4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13 ) was a much more reasonable size and I based my judgement again off its pictures and it much more closely resembled the dimensions shown by its photographic representation!"
3.0,Love Kate Spade and was excited to receive this. Very disappointed. It’s quite stuff. Strap is not adjustable and it sits too high on me. (Size 12 I wear). Should have listened to other reviews. Returning.
3.0,Cute but way too big for little kids.
3.0,"I've had this for 2 years now, slips off just as bad as the night I first had it :( but maybe I have a big ass head"
3.0,I love the hat and it is now my summer weight cover.  I did not receive the beautiful feather that was advertised.
3.0,The strap could be a little longer for people with a thick wrist.
3.0,"For an oversized cami, I was expecting more room but it fits close to the curves, so for some  it would be fine."
3.0,I like the style - only thing lacking is the ability to have a snug fit when needed - Thanks & wish you many sunny days!
3.0,A little darker then the picture. Not sure if I will wear them.
3.0,"I bought the set for my oldest grandson, choosing the size he would grow into a little bit.  It was too small.  He had to give the set to his younger brother, so I will be taking him to a store to buy one the fits."
3.0,"thread was broken for the first try, and beads went all over the  floor.....also replaced the linker"
3.0,"Stiff fabric, doesn't feel like satin at all."
3.0,Item is not the quality portrayed on-site. It’s just okay. I would not recommend purchasing.
3.0,Haven't worn yet but when I tried it on its very comfortable
3.0,"Great looking suit, but runs small. I returned the first one, cost me $25 to return it, and got the next size up. It is more lime a super slim fit. Looks great and is comfortable."
3.0,Will work for me. Not what was expected but will do.
3.0,"Cute pattern- not too tight, but not sure I'll feel the difference in leg fatigue either."
3.0,"not great quality, obviously for the price point it wouldnt be.<br /><br />woudve gotten 4 stars if it had come with a battery"
3.0,"After reading reviews I ordered one size bigger knowing they run small, and they fit great! I would leave 5 stars but I was sent the wrong color. :("
3.0,material looks a little cheap
3.0,"My son loves it, but there were some scuff marks on it and it isn’t the best quality. For what we paid for it, it isn’t worth it. Only helmet we could find."
3.0,NICE!!!! WORTH THE WAIT.
3.0,KINDA PALE
3.0,"Be careful with the size chart provided. The sizes are NOT accurate.  Order up approximately 2-3 sizes up. The material is exactly as described. I wash on cold, and air dry. Very comfortable. Beautiful color. The design is really stylish. Absolutely love the look, color, and material."
3.0,"I intended giving these to my daughter who wanted gold hoops.  As they were described as &#34;gold-plated&#34; I purchased them.  However, they look like brass and did not remotely resemble the gold plate in a necklace I bought for her.  I decided to keep them myself and got others for my daughter"
3.0,"I'm 5'2 140 lb and ordered a medium. This coat is okay. It fits but it's a little large. It's pretty thin material and kind of cheap looking. For $40, I believe I can find a better quality coat."
3.0,"I received the Sandals in good time.  When I put them on the rubber piece that goes between you toes was very irritating.  There was excess material (from the molding process?) that i had to cut off with a knife and then sand down.  I plan on using these sandals while using the sauna and showering at the gym so they just need to be comfortable for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.  Today will be the first time that I will be using them so we'll see.  Thanks, Vern"
3.0,My son picked these out and loves that it comes with a swim cap.  I bought his usual US size and the fit is spot on.  The elastic in the waistband isn't tacked down though and is already twisting after only a few uses.  The drawstring is similarly not attached and has come out.  It's a decent set but I feel that there are better options available as it's already needing repair.
3.0,Was a cute dress but way to tight in bust area
3.0,Cool image but definitely a size smaller than advertised.
3.0,"Cute, but not very big."
3.0,Didn't have a strap to hold on to put phone in the side spot and the zipper broke on both side
3.0,"Okay, so, these are cute. The patterns at least. But they are HUGE. Maybe I didn’t look closely enough at the dimensions, but wow. I don’t know if I’ll even wear them, they’re so big. Well made, and pretty. But the size may mean a return."
3.0,"The material was really nice. But I sent it back because I felt the the way the dress is cut is not flattering on a shorter person. It’s wide. Maybe if your tall this is a better fit for you. Also, felt like it ran larger than expected."
3.0,Received product exactly has described. Satisfied either purchase
3.0,Not real comfortable
3.0,"I love the clips,  but never received the jump rings pictured 😞"
3.0,I really wanted to like these - I liked the material but they were just too small for the size I ordered. I returned them.
3.0,"Beautiful product, however started to tarnish within a week. So if you’re looking for daily wear this is not the product for you."
3.0,Like the style but the fabric is horrible. No one would use that type of fabric to make clothes!
3.0,Loved the look but wayyyyy too small
3.0,It is ok.  Would not order another one.
3.0,It’s cute but rides up on my chicken and does not cover her back side as well as others I bought.  The material is thick enough and the pattern is cute.  I am using it on a full size Cochin which is a larger breed chicken.  I wish the back saver was longer.
3.0,"When I see pictures of gals modeling in ""sexy,""  workout gear, I just assume that on a normal looking person like me, it will look... normal.  Well, this romper is SEXY, and I wouldn't feel comfortable going out of the house in it.  It looks more like shape wear to me.  I do appreciate the padded bosom area, and the fact that it  can be buttoned up.  I just feel too exposed in this to be comfortable running or getting my sweat on.  If you wanted something to wear as athleisure for going out and just looking cute, this may work for you.  It is cut a little small, in my opinion, just size wise.  But I think i can still use this piece as a ""bodysuit,"" under a maxi skirt, for the warmer weather, because the top is cute and flattering.  Or I'll use it as shape wear, because it does hold you in."
3.0,"Glasses were a bit smaller then I expected, lenses are very dark, it was a good price, but I would not buy again."
3.0,These are nice but have a strange lining. They are very thick so they would be good in cold climates but they are too thick for me.
3.0,"It was split in back, so it hangs more like an A line on, and my hips are not 10 inches wider than my waist. This is definetly for curvy girls."
3.0,"Earrings are nice, but do not order with the plastics backs. They do not secure the studs adequately.  I have already lost one of the earrings because the back fell off."
3.0,"I love the top from the waist down, however the top is very snug...and I am not a large busted woman at all.(36B) The top is just so small compared to the rest of the shirt.  The neckline is very wide, almost off the shoulder and the top is very clingy and almost see through. I will have to wear a sweater over it as it it too clingy to wear a tank under. I should have ordered a size larger....but I already went up a size....so it was interesting. Good fabric and nice colors!"
3.0,"Nice fit, comfortable. After wearing for a couple weeks, it is starting to pill."
3.0,The chockers were a little large for my neck but they come in various styles and are super edgy.
3.0,I used this to make a hydration vest for running and it is almost perfect. I just wish it came in extra large. I have a big rib cage.
3.0,Must be only for small men
3.0,Strings came loose after a few uses
3.0,The quality looks and feels good.  I chose option one which fits straight up and down and closer. If you’re used to wearing what looks like a wider in option to just be aware of the  closer . I do like the mash ventilation..<br /><br /> Now for the negative side of things. The smaller pockets could be larger there is plenty of room and ample room to make the zippers wider. It would add extra space and make getting your hands or just your fingers in the back it’s much easier. What seems to be common with these types of fast is the zipper  Tab is on the wrong side! It makes putting the zipper together and taking the two sides apart unnecessarily difficult. Especially if you switch between jackets who have normal zippers for men’s jackets.<br />I will wear it for a day or two and decide whether I should keep them or not.
3.0,"The beads are on special for 1 cent each!  However, the shipping per bead is over 6 bucks - not total or combined - per bead.  I ordered 10 and when I checked out my shipping was $69 dollars!!!!!  I cancelled the transaction.  I actual is $7 per bead with free shipping.  It is still cheap, but buyer beware of hidden shipping! Rated it a three because you have to rate to post a comment."
3.0,I've had purse about two weeks and strap has already fallen off.  I like the purse and hope that by putting it back on it will stay. Leather is decent for the price. Did not receive it on date I was a guaranteed though.
3.0,"The shirt was cute but the sleeves on me were way too long. You couldn't even see my hands. I am 5'4"" so I'm short but legit no hands. Cute shirt but not worth hemming the sleeves."
3.0,"Comfortable, but they do slide around when running."
3.0,The only complaint really is that the suitcases don't fit easily into each other when storing them away.
3.0,"Does not look or fit anything as in the picture, it's a bit big."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:1a49894dd3d14cc8cf650fbb3f0bb534]] WE ARE MISSING AN EAR PLEASE SEND US ANOTHER
3.0,Fun!!!
3.0,"This dress is okay. The white buttons look cheap, but the fabric itself is cute. Wish it had brown buttons. I’ve worn it twice. It’s okay...."
3.0,"The clasp is a rubber clasp, not a butterfly clasp as it shows in the pictures or in the descriptions. On some of the pins I could see the color mix on to other colors, but besides that the product was okay."
3.0,It's a beautiful shirt but I ordered too small
3.0,3/4 sleeves. 3xl was closer to asian xL
3.0,"These were super cute, fit good but just wasn't my style once they got here."
3.0,"It looks very nice on, fits perfectly.  The material is a little thin but I will say it is well made. Can't wait to wear it on my cruise"
3.0,Just ok. Runs big and material is hot.
3.0,Very cheap looking and broke almost immediately. Not worth what I paid.
3.0,"This is fine for the price. it runs a bit small and it looks okay, but for the price what do you expect? Its not as pretty as in the picture and is not a ring you want to wear to wash your hands. Its just another piece of cheap custom jewelry. Do you really need the clutter?"
3.0,"Too large, too big... I don’t know."
3.0,"The mask is not confortable, is too bulky; not a good perchase"
3.0,"Very flattering, I’m small chested and it co era nicely. I ordered the red2 and the pattern by the chest is not as pictured. It’s much more orange than red."
3.0,"These boots are very cute, but they are way big. My toddler is a size 4, and these booties are bigger than the size 5’s I have from old navy (which she doesn’t fit yet). I was hoping they would be true to size and fit her for this winter but they don’t make smaller sizes. I’ll be returning them since she won’t fit them before the weather gets warm again."
3.0,Size chart is all weird.  Recommend order a size or two LARGER!
3.0,Pretty and simple but I’ve worn for 4 days and already looks a little tarnished on one side. Pro: has not turned my finger
3.0,Fabric  not a good fit. Sorry.
3.0,"The pants fit ok, but the fabric is not remotely soft. The outside of the fabric is almost scratchy, the inside was just ok. Maybe would have softened up with washing? I’m returning."
3.0,"The tag was in the front of the pants which was super uncomfortable and when I received the pants they had some sort of stain on the back. Not terrible pants but definitely not my favorite, so I am returning."
3.0,"Several years late posting this.<br />I bought the dark brown strap with a gold buckle to put on a gold watch I have.  The buckle is large and chunky and matched the watch well, but the strap has a purple tint to it.<br />I only wore that setup a few times and didn't like it.  I had every intention of returning the watch strap, but never got around to it.<br />I like the thickness, but it is obviously 2 pieces of leather glued together, the seam is very prevalent.<br />I swapped out the buckle and put it on a different watch. I am going to wear it for a week or so and see how it breaks in, then try to use something yellow in it to cancel out the purple and see if I can make it brown."
3.0,While cute the shoe is a bit wide and one string doesn't work properly. It seems to be sewn in on one side. They would be fine just to play in but this is for class. I was going to order a pair for my other daughter but will probably pay a little more for better quality.
3.0,"I bought it for my lovely wife.. she's satisfied with the fit but the only issue is the placement of the stripes.  Based on the pics the black stripes should be around her waist area, sad to say the white portion is at the waist part which my wife says forfeits the needed style to make a girls tummy a bit small to look at.."
3.0,very nice .. ts
3.0,"Fits as expected. Color as expect. But, cheap belt. Nice buckle. The belt is lightweight. But, I didn’t expect much for the money. I won’t wear it that often, so it works with the shoes I bought it to wear with."
3.0,Very cute jacket. But I'm 5'5 190lbs and I ordered a medium and it's still too big :/ I was wanting it to be more form fitting
3.0,"el producto es una pulsera que es hasta de moda, sin embargo me alivio al 60% un dolor de espada baja, cre"
3.0,"I'm 125lbs, 5ft 5in, I ordered a small and it's on the big size. The shorts are extremely long making it unflattering. The quality seems to be very good. I gave it to my mom, it's more of an older generation style."
3.0,The fit was good but gunk kept getting stuck in the cracks.
3.0,"Was too large, I used to wear xl and I bought this size, but definitely can't use it. Was toooooo large, like 2 sizes up than normal."
3.0,Nice looking but I don’t like the clasp. Can barely get it undone. Beads are really cool looking with swirls in them. Can tell they are a handmade set.
3.0,I had similar tanks from years ago that started falling apart. I found these at a good price. I really like the weight of the fabric for layering. The shoulder straps could be longer but not an issue for me. I’ve only worn the white one so far but the lace on the bottom was either not sewn completely or came unstitched. I can fix it but quality could be better.
3.0,"It is an okay top. Not as flattering as I had expected, but it's not terrible. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Not sure I would purchase it again."
3.0,good ok new
3.0,This is a gift but I wouldn’t buy again. T-shirt material is very flimsy. You can almost see their.
3.0,Very pretty but the shoulder strap was not long enough. As a cross body it came up till middle of my waist while it should be on my hip. Returning it.
3.0,material was too thin and mostly see through
3.0,The blue colour came off every time we used them and made my toddler look like a smurf
3.0,It is nice but a little heavy for a girls head. It is fully made of metal parta so its weight is quite considerable.
3.0,If you have a Lot of hair this is not for you. I love the design of the head wrap but I have too much hair for the little pouch on the back. I literally have to stuff my hair to wear it to sleep
3.0,Silky thin material.. the bottom looks off. Not like the picture
3.0,No where in the description of this item did it reveal that these were corduroy jeans. Not what I was expecting. In fact I’m disappointed.
3.0,"a little tight, hard to get on."
3.0,"These are nice. I like spunky soul earrings, but these aren't as dainty and fine as the picture. These are a little bit heavy and bulky than I thought they would be."
3.0,Very cheap.  Broke
3.0,The band slips and needs to be adjusted too frequently. Looks great and good quality
3.0,"Way to small, sleeves, shoulders, chest all too small.<br />I had a friend bring it to me as I live in Argentina, so I can't return it. Now I have to give it away to someone.<br />I liked the shirt ,but who ever does the sizing on these needs a clip around the ear!"
3.0,Very very small.  If you want it to fit like a beach dress you should order 3 or 4 sizes up.  Otherwise it hugs so tight and is so short it isnt flattering at all.  The company responded to me with in a couple of hours and took care of everything so I give the company a 5 STAR.
3.0,"Probably the best on the market, but not what they use to be.  The leather components are thinner, split leather, and not wearing well.  This is the second pair I've owned.  The first lasted over a decade of almost daily use.  This one will not come near that."
3.0,"Got this shirt cheap on a lightning deal. It’s not bad for the price, but the material is scratchy and cheaply made. The white part at the bottom is very see-through and the shirt is very long."
3.0,stll havent worn it cuz its tight
3.0,"I bought this as an element for a costume, but I was hoping to wear it casually as well. Unfortunately, it's a touch too small to wear comfortably. It is difficult to zipper and tight around the waist. If you order this, order a size up; it comes with a belt, you can always make it tighter. It looks okay, but isn't the most flattering skirt for my body type, especially because the waist lays funny due to the tightness. The material is nice though, and it will still work well for a costume I'll only wear once or twice."
3.0,Was Tight in the chest
3.0,Material wrinkles up after 1st use. The shirt will not iron out correctly. The fit is a bit tight.
3.0,the color is more like a gray green<br />and if you look on the models its supposed to hit the thighs but only goes to my mid hip<br />still a pretty shirt
3.0,"Got these for my girlfriend for a trip to the beach and on the boat. They are just okay. She didn’t like the quality. They are more for bedroom play than public use. Cheap but you get what you pay for. If you want something to wear out to the beach or boat, pay a little more."
3.0,While the product was of a good quality it was way too small
3.0,Cute while it lasted bought it in the beginning of the year and now it's November and the are ripping. Worth it since I wear it constantly
3.0,while they do &#34;transition&#34; its only about 2 shades of grey. they are also a bit off on the cut out so i had to force them in to lock the 1st time. Polarization is ok again under $60. will be buying the name brands lens soon!!
3.0,The material is not what I expected but is is fair!
3.0,The chain broke once I got it but it's good quality.
3.0,"Overall these are high quality sunglasses, no doubt about that. Well-built, sturdy, and fairly comfortable. I will say they are slightly heavier than other sunglasses, probably due to the acetate frame and heavy hinges. The color of the frame is beautiful.<br /><br />The quality of the lenses is excellent, but my main gripe was that they were just not dark enough. Sure, the glare is gone, but I still found myself squinting on a bright sunny day. Polarization is much more even than my pair of Dolce Gabbana sunglasses.<br /><br />Also, these frames are quite wide, so it was prone to slipping down my nose no matter how much the pads were adjusted.<br /><br />I sadly had to return these. Even with the Amazon price they are not cheap. I will keep looking for Persol's since the quality is miles ahead of other &#34;designer&#34; sunglasses."
3.0,"Great color. Good price. Fabric is on the stretchy side and although soft, felt more like a ""polyester"" than a cotton which to me signals hot and sweaty. The cut was also wrong for my body shape. It felt large enough on the top half but too form fitting on me around the waist and hips.  It might work on you if you're larger on top than around the middle and hips. Based on other reviews I ordered down to a 1x even though I usually wear a 2x. I had to return based on fabric and size."
3.0,sent it back. bigger than I thought and too soft
3.0,I'm disappointed it is too small because it won't  fit around my wristI really like it.
3.0,a little too low cut
3.0,Very warm and stylish just runs small looks just like picture love the fur only worn once fits me snug due to sizing will probably donate
3.0,It's says 5 but it's fit like size 3
3.0,Nice looking shirt. Just didn’t like the way it fits and feels. Little tight and not the most comfortable.
3.0,"They looks cool and my kids like them, but they aren't meant for playing. One snapped the day it was delivered and the other had a claw fall out of the notch or was attached to on the handle. The plastic is not strong."
3.0,"I guess it's OK and as described but I don't want to be struggling when the rain starts falling while pulling this over my head and backpack. NICE, bright color and waterproof but not for me."
3.0,"ordered both the brown and black pair and request return for defects in both , the elastic has worn out and stretched out so that neither pair fits properly anymore after just one month of wear ,"
3.0,"The necklace and charm are very pretty and I really like the look.  However, the charm does not close securely and the chain clasp is difficult.  I am hesitant to put anything inside the locket because it pops open."
3.0,Fits well. Material is a bit cheap.
3.0,Kinda different fit than I would have wanted
3.0,"Nice band, it is actually metal, but the paint wears off somewhat quickly, and it broke in 5 months."
3.0,Unfortunately a little to short. I'm a 5'9 plus size and wanted it to almost touch the floor but it did not. I will return.
3.0,"Very supportive...  Much easier to put on compared to my other medical, support socks but VERY<br />difficult to remove!"
3.0,I love the color but material is actually for warmer weather. It fits like a tee-shirt dress.
3.0,Product title claims 3 pieces but there are only 2 scarves.
3.0,Material is very thin for the price
3.0,barely come over her knee and falls down. she’s looking for a true thigh<br />high that will stay up on its own
3.0,"I like the color scheme, however, deducting two stars due to sleeves and not actually worth the price. I did get two pattern colors for basically the price of one, had I not received the discounted rate I probably would have returned the items. The material is thin and the sleeves will not fit if you have thick arms."
3.0,Cute but not very warm.
3.0,"Like the tank. Ordered onein each size bc I was unsure on sizing. I'm keeping the Small but only bc all 3 shirts were pretty much the exact same size (length and width). The hemline on the Small is a bit crooked and I wish the arm hole wasn't AS big as it is. This top is not for very large busted gals. The front doesn't cover my chest fully, lots of side boob. In my pics you can see the 3 size tags, then I put the shirts on top of each other L on bottom, S on top so you can see there's not much difference."
3.0,Loose fitting at the top of sleeve
3.0,"After only a few minutes after taking the shirt out of the package the button broke. The straps were to long and hung lower than expected on me but I was able to fix both problems by sewing the button back on and sewing the strap together. Overall the shirt was really cute once I fixed it and not to expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Great shoe but way to wide for my B width.  Wish it had been smaller as it was so comfy.
3.0,"Love the look of these earrings, but the post are a little too thick thick and made my ears sore. can't wear them for too long at a time."
3.0,I don't like the arm cut / no sewing. It's rear I don't know I want to keep
3.0,"They are super soft! I'm tall, so the &#34;capri&#34; only reaches to my knees, not past, and it's not flattering. I guess &#34;not flattering&#34; is my main description of these leggings, not in the waist, butt, or knees. Too bad."
3.0,"I have a short torso so I had to stitch the back tie into the lower half of the suit. Besides that, pretty cute!"
3.0,It fell apart quite fast as it’s only cardboard
3.0,"As other reviewers have pointed out. They are made for skinner women than me.  I have a booty and they look great if I keep pulling them up in back, or wear with tunic.  Would never wear them to yoga.  Just fun holiday leggings but if you aren’t built like a stick know they are kind of low waisted.  Still kept them and they are fun and festive and I get a lot of comments."
3.0,Good for everyday wear or for special occasions.  The silver is the best color of the three pairs.  A good value for these earrings.
3.0,"This dress is super comfy, and I have worn it once. I love the pockets, and the softness of the fabric. What I don't like- it didn't go to my feet, it's around my ankles- i am 5'7, and the top across the chest- the fabric is very see through. I bought the navy blue dress, and I currently am currently 38DD due to nursing. The fabric stretches across the chest area. I might buy it again just because it is comfortable and I can wear it around the house."
3.0,This is a beautiful case. But the film around the case starts to bubble and peel quickly. Doesn’t last long. Pretty disappointed.
3.0,"The feathers were soft and fluffy but I ordered two fans and one fan came that was slightly smaller and didnt have as long of feathers as the other.<br /><br />The staves are a thin wood that flex easily.<br /><br />Overall okay for a budget set, I added more feathers and fluffed them up. Works great for a beginner burlesque costume"
3.0,"The chest & hips fit as expected for the size small; I am a size 4 pants and a 36B chest. Any bigger than that and you'd want to get a Medium. I am 5'5 and the backside was dangerously close to wedgie status especially when bending over that would not self-correct. The front was fine, but on a hot day or sitting a while, this might get uncomfortable.  Also the fabric was WAY thinner than the photo makes it look. I thought it would be more of a thick cotton/linen that would need to be ironed. What it actually is is super thin, see through polyester. Wears more like a 2nd skin. You'd have to be strategic about what undergarments you wear. Ultimately, I don't want to have to think twice about an outfit I am wearing for a special occassion, so I returned it."
3.0,Zippers Rusty and Black Marks all over Looks like ink Pen broke in the package.
3.0,"There were some loose threads, I cut it off. apart from that it does what it says."
3.0,These glasses look great and are very light weight as described.  A huge reason why I purchased the glasses was their description also claimed they had spring arms/hinges.  This inaccuracy by the maker is either intentional or a careless oversight.  Neither is an endearing quality but the outcome is the same...  I ended up with glasses I would not have bought if the description were truthful.
3.0,"Do not go by the photo of the girl wearing it. That photo was stolen off Etsy by the person actually hand knitting them. Go by the photo of just the hat. It is more accurate. Still a nice knit hat, but the white rim is a bit thin and the white ball is small. I have a large head though and it fit fine"
3.0,"I like this watch for its simplicity and lightness.  My only complaint is that the back light is rather faint, making it hard to see the display in the dark.  For a similar model with a stronger backlight, I found the &quot;Illuminator&quot; model, F105W-1A at https://www.amazon.com/Casio-F105W-1A-Illuminator-Sport-Watch/dp/B000GB1RAU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499526663&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=casio+illuminator  This costs a bit more, but I think it's worth it."
3.0,It's okay.  it is all plastic or similar material.
3.0,Smaller and less sparkly than hoped.
3.0,"Pros: good price, color selection, cute pattern.<br /><br />Cons: very thin material, material frays."
3.0,"Listen to the other reviews...these run SMALL.  Go at least a size up if your legs aren't toothpicks in diameter.  I'm 5'7&#34; and did an XL.  They hit right at my ankles.  I was worried they wouldn't stay up, but the waistband is a little wider than most leggings, so even with Spanx underneath they stayed pretty well in place (I wore a long shirt though, just in case).  The sequins go in every which direction, and they will get caught on things, so don't wear any long top that will easily snag.  I got a ton of compliments on them and felt like the Little Mermaid after she gets her legs.  They are a lot of fun and I like that the sequins are only on the front so they weren't getting stuck on chairs.  They washed well, with no sequins coming off (I did wash them inside out).  The leather is only on the back and waist, so if sequins do start to come off, the front will start to look see-thru.<br />Update:<br />After 2 washes, the sequin front started separating from the &#34;leather&#34; back.  I can't sew to save my life, and with all the sequins, I'm not sure they will be salvageable.  There's thin black material under the sequins, so it's not as if you can see my skin, but still...no one wants to wear pants with unintentional holes in them!  They worked for what I needed, but I don't usually spend this much money on something I'll only wear once or twice."
3.0,Not flattering and way too big.
3.0,was absolutely beautiful however it was a little large around the chest and too short. I prefer mine to hit the ground. I am 5'5&#34; .
3.0,I got an M and I’m usually an M but they were too loose in some areas
3.0,I liked the shirt. It seemed of good quality. It was a Poly/linen blend of fabric. I ordered a large and it arrived very small. Closer to a US small than the Large I ordered. Though it was tagged large. I had to return it. I would suggest buying a size or 2 larger.
3.0,"It was kind of small, so I put it up in my office like an MVP jersey. :-)"
3.0,"Had to modify the bottom by cutting a 3"" slit on each side so it would rest right on my neck.also a little tight but I do have a big head."
3.0,It’s like someone just put it together anyone could do it.  Only because I’m using it for coverup.
3.0,does not appear to be water resistant like the original fitbit band.  Other than that is just fine.  I wear my fitbit flex in the shower and for water aerobics so this band just isn't what I expected.
3.0,"Love it for spring, but it’s very see through. I’m not keen on wearing slips so it’s used as a cover up or I wear it with leggings"
3.0,These socks fit and felt great. Just not happy with how quickly they wore down. Only wore them at home and slept with them on. After 3 weeks they already had a hole in the heel.
3.0,"The chain is different than pictured. It was very short, not stainless steel and it was not hypoallergenic. The pendant itself is as pictured"
3.0,As soon as I got them I tried to put them on but the snake tail came off the backing as I tried to take the backing off. Had to weld it together because I needed them ASAP for an event. They’re cute!
3.0,"Lenses are overlarge. Cheap price is certainly attractive. Unfortunately they loosen up and one arm seems to angle out away from head when worn. I've tried bending inward at frame to tighten up, minimal help. They don't fall off so bonus, best to use in car."
3.0,"Didn’t like fit.......maybe because I’m a petite, but these came up WAY higher than I would have liked."
3.0,"If you want something super cheeky, these are great! I would have kept it if the top wasn't so awful. I hate the top. It fits so awkward and just doesnt work well with my boobs."
3.0,Wide hip area is not flattering. I don't have big hips at all but these pants make me look very wide
3.0,"This shipped so fast, I had it two days after I paid for it. It is nice and stretchy, the feathers stuck rather well but the beads are obviously cheap and the paint flicks off easily. Great for a few uses though."
3.0,"No especifica el tamaño y es tamaño para niña, imposible usarla<br />Muy pequeña"
3.0,These did not come with the backs and some were stuck together!!
3.0,Beautiful skirt and well made. Need more stretch in waistband.
3.0,"Most importantly I wanted to use for night driving to help cut down glare from headlights. The lens’s are very light yellow in color and did not suit my need for this purpose; however, the fit over my cat eye glasses is excellent and I do plan to wear them for daytime in the sun."
3.0,"Hard to read the date, but its all good. Came very quickly."
3.0,"Transparente, está bien, pero pensé que sería con mejor terminado."
3.0,"I liked the dress and it fit great ... but it isn’t exactly what I ordered.  The dress ordered was black shirt dress, black buttons , and pockets ... what I got was a black shirt dress with tan buttons and no pockets."
3.0,Fits okay but the color in it are not even.  The hood is too small to use also.  But it is still a decent casual sweatshirt.
3.0,Shoe is of great durability however...the Velcro apparently doesn't work all that well... its starting to fade and making the shoe fail.
3.0,"The shoe is very nice, however, there is a big arch support, in the middle of the shoe, making it uncomfortable to walk in For any length of time, not what I was looking for"
3.0,"So soft and cozy. But order down, fit is huge and more fluffy than I expected."
3.0,"Very heavy material but not thick, runs large had to return the small was huge"
3.0,It’s on the thin side and was smaller than expected but it’s pretty
3.0,"I did not realize they were goggles.  too big, no way would they fit my small face.  gave them to my son.  Now I notice they have womens night driving glasses, I may give them a try.  hope they are much smaller."
3.0,I love the style. However I expected the inside to be a more quality lining.  Its leather so didn't expect the low quality liner
3.0,The quality of the outfit is as expected with this price but the shirt is way to small and the pants are a bit big. I liked the outfit a lot better in the picture not so much in person. Pretty disappointed 😔.
3.0,"Cute top, very stylish. The material is sturdy and nice. Fit a big snug on me, but I prb should have ordered a M instead of a S. Disappointed with the stitching, the  bottom side crotch part came undone and unstitched after my first wear."
3.0,"While the dress fit nice and I liked the style, the bottom was completely see-through.  I got the white one, so other colors may not have that issue."
3.0,"Pretty, but the shape was off. It was oddly tight on the upper arms so when I tried reaching for anything it was uncomfortable. It was also very static-clingy and I shocked everybody I touched all day. Bummed, but returning."
3.0,I love the cuteness however the clamp won't stay shut. I was hoping it would of last longer than the first day.
3.0,This would be great for someone with C+ chest and less than 37&#34; hips. The material is very comfortable and I REALLY wish this fit better.
3.0,"It was pretty but the sizing was a bit off and the material quality was not quite what we expected. The return was easy, which we appreciated. Just did not work out for our needs"
3.0,They were great for the price. The material is not the best though.
3.0,My husband wears a size 11 - always has.  I ordered the large size of these slippers because it was to fit an 11-12.  But believe it or not they are snug.  He liked the color (brown) and how well made they appear.  He's wearing them and we're hoping they stretch.  His old pair had torn so we were in need of a new pair and none of the local stores had size 11.  Hopefully the manufacturer will change it's size chart.
3.0,"Was a bit larger than I expected. The material bunches a bit more in the shoulders, so it doesn't look like the picture. Looks more like you have shoulder pads. Just wasnt like the picture or sizing."
3.0,Black overlay on bracelet<br />Near clasp not fully covered over stainless steel with black<br />No so terrible but should be perfect
3.0,"The fit was great, but they are see through when you bend over."
3.0,My daughter got these. Said they're too tight and the soles are coming apart after a few wears.
3.0,"Nice frames, the tortoise is a matte. The lenses are clear and look like perscription lenses. These look very square on my face. Notice the side nose peices in the picture of the black frames. It is huge!!"
3.0,"I like thicker, softer socks that don't fit as tightly."
3.0,Much shorter post than most of the earrings that I buy at my piercer... caused my ear to swell quite a bit :(<br /><br />Won't be buying these again just be aware when buying them.
3.0,"The hat has a Great fit and is made really well... Little bummed bc the Hat I ordered was supposed to say &#34;Y'all Need Jesus&#34; and the one I received said &#34;Hey Y'all&#34;... not a big deal, but its not what I ordered!"
3.0,"metal kind of made my ears itchy & they don't quite lay flat as pictured, but pretty cute overall."
3.0,"This was a very light hat but not for the extreme cold I would have needed.  Besides it was too big so I returned it.  If you are looking for a hat for not too cold temps, this would be nice."
3.0,"For the price, I expected better finishing. It was too late to return when I discovered threads coming out."
3.0,"I am 5'4, 175 lbs. I ordered an XL and when I tried it on, I strapped it to the smallest it can go and it fits perfectly. I realized that I could probably even fit a large which I should've bought since I am trying to lose weight. When I tried it, it looks really cute haha. Obviously its see-through so you need a black bra, or if you don't want that to show, wear a nipple pad so that way people can still see the nice design.<br /><br />However when I look closer to it, I can see that the person who did this, did not do very well on the seams. There is threading that is coming undone from the band. I would also be careful putting it on because it is of course just bunch of thread put into a design so anything can almost rip it. So try not to get it caught on anything. Another thing is that obviously it doesn't offer any support to your chest. Other than those cons, the design and the bralette itself is really pretty!<br />I apologize the photo is sideways but thats the XL.<br /><br />I receive this product at a discount price for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Beautiful bra but runs small to cover the outsides.
3.0,"The case came broke, also the glasses are not as good as I thought"
3.0,They are nice socks but I’m a size 8.5 in shoes and they are a little too small for me!
3.0,It looks nice but broke within 2 days.
3.0,"Wish I read the reviews first. &#34;Buttons down the front&#34; is misleading. There are no button holes, just elastic loops at the edge of the fabric to slide buttons into. This leaves about an inch gap down whole front of the dress. I have a sewing machine and plan to sew the spit up if I don't return it. Fabric is a bit thin but feels strong enough. I think with the dark color, it may be fine with a slip. The string is black not white (which blends nicer)."
3.0,"The blouse is far more open and low cut in front than it looks, and must be worn with a camisole under it. Also, it is rather short - too short to cover the bottom of the camisole."
3.0,"Looks great. Unfortunately the elastic bands are starting to tear at the corners after only a month, so I will have to sew new ones on eventually."
3.0,I would have like it better If it came in a extra small. It stretches however so I felt like it was a little loose. I'm 5'2 and weigh 136 pounds
3.0,"These stud look really nice, and they came within the shipping period that they told me, however they are REALLY short, so if you're like me and you have thick lips I wouldn't recommend them, the lip ring was so short that the gem started to go into the opening of my monroe piercing."
3.0,"The watch came packaged poorly - and the box was broken, which was an initial disappointment. Overall this is a very basic watch.  Cheap materials, vinyl band. It is very readable, and would be ideal for someone with poorer eyesight. The design is clean and simple."
3.0,"The torso is way shorter than I expected. I bought a 14 (I’m 5’4” and 3 months postpartum, about 175 lbs). Were it a bit longer, it would have been a great swimsuit. Just didn’t come up high enough to cover the girls."
3.0,I ordered a 4g and the ones that came in were smaller so I had to return them. I loved the quality and the aquamarine colored gemstones . May purchase another set when I go up to 0G .
3.0,It was two small for my fingers need a bigger size in it like a 8 maybe
3.0,A lot of push up and together which makes it a bit overflowing rather than sexy
3.0,"The fit is alright(just a little small) and they're fairly comfortable, but the bottoms have a habit of rolling up a little on me which is a little annoying."
3.0,Awesome item awesome price. Great quality. Only one thing the latch for closing isn't very sturdy didn't hold well but was an easy fix so no return needed.
3.0,"i ended up spending over 3X the cost of this item because of the shipping - I needed it as I bought a wallet and beed the extra pics (my dad carries a lot of pics) and I didnt want the hassle of going to stores in my area looking for this, but this should be an add-on item as the price was so cheap, but the shipping was so much.<br /><br />The item itself is satisfactory for a wallet holder."
3.0,My son loves pokemon so I ordered this for him for his birthday. It came 2 days before his birthday (my fault for waiting) but it came dirty. There is a black stain just outside the white ball.
3.0,"Purchased the dress as a costume for my daughters school play. I purchased an 8 and it was slightly large for her, she usually wears an 8. It is OK quality. More of a one time use dress. The sash frayed before we left the house.  For the price it was perfect for our intended use."
3.0,Looks 👍. Too Small.
3.0,The only problem I see is the uneven pressure in some areas. There should be a smoother graduated pressure. In defense for what I paid they were still a great bargain.
3.0,"Hurts my sons calves, they rub on him and it’s uncomfortable leaving a mark."
3.0,Like the style and the print on the bottom is lovely.
3.0,Typical knitted socks.
3.0,Wasn’t as comfortable or cute as I had expected
3.0,"I thought the Star Fish was solid, however it's a cast. im wearing it to get my money's worth."
3.0,"looks and feels great above the water but inside the water, the view is blurry and images are curved ( probably acting like a prism) which makes me dizzy when I look under water. No leak, Easily adjustable. I like the ear and nose pieces that come with the product. Great case, keeps it scratch free."
3.0,"Color just as pictured...order one size up, should be perfect"
3.0,"Hi guys,<br />I'm writing this review based on my first use of this t-shirt.<br />It fits perfect, does hold off sweat, and nice colors!<br />I do see that the finish of the product isn't that nicely.<br />But for the price, you pay they are sure superb!"
3.0,Every single earing came bent and the circle ones have actual damage to them but for the price they aren't all that bad. I straightened them out and all but the circles are fine to wear.
3.0,Get a size lower if u want compression if u r bigger like 2x or bigger get a size up unless u like ur tits squished
3.0,Look nothing like the picture.
3.0,This blazer runs small.  I not a big person but I had to purchase a XL in this blazer.
3.0,Nice quality but thinner than I expected. Bit over priced in my opinion for a thin acrylic sweater.
3.0,"I like this necklace, I just wish the chain was a bit longer.  The chain goes to about your chest and not as long as the picture shows."
3.0,"fitted, doesn't leave a lot of room for under layers"
3.0,They are so cute! A little small for my newborn’s head though.. they leave indents on her little head. Ive even tried stretching them out before putting them on her.
3.0,Teeny tiny. And REEKED like factory. Returned them.
3.0,"Not sure if the description stated they were one sided, but keep that in mind when purchasing. Other than that, these are super cute and good quality."
3.0,I thought it was glass and you could see through it. Should not have metal back.
3.0,"As for the fit, Just as expected, cute style, however the belt does not look like the picture at all more like a think piece of material. If you have large arms be careful as it will be super tight on the arms.  As for the white color it is more like off white, a cream color, I bought it for an all white party and was not able to wear it.  Maybe a different color would be better, and for someone with small or more normal arms."
3.0,Cute shoes but very cheaply made buckle that i don't expect to last long and the SMELL of terrible chemicals on the shoes that still hasn't come out.
3.0,Looks much more cheap in person than pictured
3.0,It's pretty and makes the watch look more sophisticated but the chain keeps coming loose and I am having to continuously adjust it.  There have been a couple times where the chain adjuster thingy wouldn't hold the chain.
3.0,Very odd fit. Bought an XL and it's a bit too small across the shoulders. Has a very odd collar/neckline. Length is ok. Bought the blue flower one in a L and it fit fine.
3.0,"The quality on this set was ok and the color was true to the pictures, a pretty navy blue. The style was fun and a bit different, though it was fun and different from other sets with the tie-back feature.<br /><br />However, the size recommended on their chart did not fit well, so if you're going for it be sure to size up from what it says."
3.0,"it's about double the normal bead size so it really stands out.  And also catches on things, why not a 5 star rating. It is well done and detail is good."
3.0,"nice mask, runs small"
3.0,"I purchased the black and pink and I love the colors.<br />The size was XXL , the jacket fit good and the pants was a little saggy for me. But overall it was okay. Very breathable and comfortable."
3.0,I’m giving it three stars because one of the little attachments was broken when it arrived and another one broke the second day it used it so I had to throw it away and get another one out of the pack to use.
3.0,"Cute, but WAY too small!  Returning..."
3.0,"It's OK, could have been a little taller."
3.0,I read the previous reviews and ordered an xl and it still wasn't flowy like I thought it would be.  5'3 150lbs
3.0,Cute sweater but way way way too small.
3.0,"I'm pretty small, though not tiny, and this belt is super long.  Fortunately my pants have enough loops............"
3.0,This is not a dress. It is a two piece. The top came as just a cami style top and the bottom was separate as a wrap style skirt. Based on sizing I ordered the large but bc it is a wrap style skirt I wished I could have seen how the medium fit. The whole thing didn’t do my figure any favors. I am 5’9 165. I am returning this because I don’t care for wrap skirts. The color was also off. The description said white and it was a noticeable ivory color.
3.0,Earrings are very flimsy. You have to bend them to even get them in your ear. I won't be wearing them very often because I'm afraid they'll break.
3.0,definitely not for broad shoulders. (but i knew that before buying) the dress is way too short to wear into public.
3.0,"took to long for delivery, and they where kind of small, my kid like them."
3.0,Its not as clear as in picture
3.0,Fit but way too tight or fitting.
3.0,I thought it would be somewhat larger.
3.0,Fits small We hope with wear it will stretch
3.0,"If you're built like Audrey Hepburn, I suppose this jacket could be considered a large. If you happen to have an ample bosom, don't plan on ever zipping this jacket unless the intent is to wear a compression jacket. It seems like it could have been a worthy item for wear on for cooler fall or spring mornings but around my house it's simply too snugly fitting to be wearable."
3.0,This was not good. Like a word robe.
3.0,I’ve had this for a while and so far it has held up but the metal block is really chunky and the edges are kind of sharp.
3.0,Like look and feel concerned about the zipper lasting.
3.0,"After a few times of connecting the magnets, one of them fell out and we couldn't find it. I wore it in the shower and it also tarnished a bit around the ring of the charm. I would not get these again, and I would look for something better."
3.0,"Pretty, but the straps on the back are too long and just hang funny and look weird.  The neck strap looks slightly stretched out, too.  The fit is good, and the suit is pretty, so if you care to take the time to fix the straps (shouldn't take much to take them in by hand), it might be worth keeping.<br /><br />I'm 5'7, 150 lbs (pear shaped), and usually wear a 6-8 on top and an 8-10 on bottom, and the medium fit well."
3.0,"Once it is washed the fit gets somewhat wonky.  Initially, nice material, interesting look but it probably will become a weekend top since it lost it's shape.  In the future, only fluff in dryer and board it to dry if you want it to keep it's shape."
3.0,"If your midsection is somewhat large, it wont look good in the rose-gold color. It shows everything so it wasn't as flattering as I'd hoped. I got the xl and it fit to me like a med in some areas and a large in others."
3.0,"The arms are very tight  and  the XL fits like a large.. Other than that , soft and comfy."
3.0,"These pants fit well and are exceptionally comfortable; however, they are extremely poor quality. They came with long, thick threads hanging off and they are completely see through. They are quite nice as house/pajama pants, but there is no way to go out in public with these. If they weren't see through, they would be pretty great, even though generally cheaply made."
3.0,These are ADORABLE but extremely heavy and much bigger than I expected them to be! The size would be fine if they weren’t so heavy but I can’t even wear them because of the weight.
3.0,"Nice looking band that looks like it has good quality. Unfortunately, it was too large. I got a Size 5 and own other bands of the same size. When I compared the length of this band to others of the same size, this one was around 1/4” longer and so fit too loose. I returned it and will be more cautious with this brand in the future. I don’t know if they packaged the wrong size or their bands run large but I measured my wrist as directed and, as mentioned earlier, other solo bands fit as expected."
3.0,"They are a bit small if you have larger wrists, I have decently large wrists and they barely close around my wrists."
3.0,They are warm but started pilling right away.
3.0,Too small. Fits weird too
3.0,"I ordered the ""Maple Leaf"" dress, and as stated in other reviews the background color is more of a grey than white.  It is beautiful, but unfortunately not very warm.  The fabric is very similar to moisture wicking fabric used for athletic wear, I would have preferred it be fleece lined or at least made of cotton to give a little warmth.  After reading multiple reviews stating that it runs large I decided to size down for my daughter.  When I opened the package and looked at the dress I thought it would be too small but when we tried it on it fit her perfect except for the sleeves which are a little short.  It's not enough for me to return for a size bigger because I know it would then be too baggy in her waist and too long, but the proportions seam to be a little off.  I was considering ordering another dress in the ""Daisy"" pattern, but given the lack of warmth this fabric offers I don't think I will."
3.0,"These are an okay pair of pants. However, the photos make them look like they're a little more tailored, BUT THEY'RE NOT!! The legs are baggy too. It says ""harem"" in the description, but I thought that was more in reference to the inseam, not the entire pant.<br /><br />Instead of returning them (paid more in shipping than the actual pants), I will have them taken in all around to make them worth it. I'm lucky that I don't have to pay for this.<br /><br />In the photos, I am wearing a pair of sweats underneath AND the pants...that's how baggy they are. I laid a pair of skinny leg pants on top of it, to show just how big they are. The red pants are a 25, and these XS (25.98) are way too big. There are 3-4 inches in difference.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The shipping was faster than expected, and that is something I really appreciate from sellers.<br />I like the green color, because it's as expected.<br />The style of the pants match the Amazon photos."
3.0,Packaging was nice. Quality was ok. Would not recommend it for anyone with thick long curly hair.
3.0,"These are very beautiful and look like high-quality earrings, but they broke after a week."
3.0,So thin and see through material
3.0,"So many good reviews, but I just don't feel like I'm built right for it. The fabric is really pretty but very sheer. You can clearly see the underskirt.<br />The black underdress looks really nice on me. The extra draped skirt over it makes my rear look huge :( I wish it were lined the whole way down, because the mini-length liner makes matters worse, and makes for staticy, unneeded awkwardness in a maxi-length skirt."
3.0,"The best part is the chain which is nice and sturdy.  The ""opals"" are just glitter and resin as you can see in my pictures.  It is still adorable but not what was represented"
3.0,It meets my need for being 100% silk for wrapping my hair<br />The colors weren't as vibrant as I would have liked.
3.0,"Nice hat. But the color is a little off, and the quality is a little off.. but nice for the price."
3.0,"I bought this to go with a navy dress I had. It fits well but after only about 5 wears it's already falling apart! Save yourself some time, money, and stress, and temporarily splurge on a better design. This one is not sufficient for more than one or two uses."
3.0,The watch band is a nice quality and looks good…however it easily falls off.  I’ve found it in the street several times so I quit wearing it.
3.0,Just a little too blocky for it to fit into my range bag.
3.0,"Item arrived on time but had glue droppings on finish that you could see. I had to scrap off the glue, which made some items look dull."
3.0,was a bit disappointed but it is nice
3.0,"I have used the waist trainer for about 2 wks and even though the fit is good( I ordered a L--I'm 5'6&#34;,148lbs) the rods on the front have both broken through the fabric and have been discarded. I can still wear it and it still provides some back support."
3.0,"Works okay, but the nose bridge pieces that are replacements don't stay in place, so they pop off and out as soon as you try and put the goggles over your head. The default (medium sized) is just too small for my face, so the hard plastic bridge digs into my nose. Other than that, they work great. If the nose pieces were better made (or soft rubber instead of hard plastic) it'd be a 5-star item. No such luck."
3.0,"I bought this because I needed a clown costume while being pregnant. I'm usually a size 10-12. I would say that for the size this costume is marketed toward, it runs small. I think if someone size 22 wore this it will be too tight. Quality wise it's the stretchy cheap fabric, but it is not see through. The pink lace on the neck and arms are scratchy. With that said, because the costume isn't restrictive, it is comfortable, other than the itchy lace. I'm 5'3&#34; and the dress comes right above my knee, so it might be more like a shirt for someone taller."
3.0,"Very cute dress but the sleeves were incredibly tight! Like ridiculously tight. The hoop skirt was great, gave the dress good volume. I didn’t have an issue with movement or sitting in the dress, only issue was the newborn size sleeves."
3.0,Size runs small. Not as comfortable as expected.
3.0,would have given it five stars but the jacket is too snug<br />I bought this suit in an extra large the pants are perfect but the jacket is very snug I wish sellers would let buyer mix and match sizes I<br /> needed a xxL for the top and extra large for the bottom . If you're top heavy you might want to get a xxL
3.0,"They're good for the money but the waist band, on one of the pairs that I purchased, didn't make it 2 hours before they lost elasticity. As far as compression goes they're 5 stars hands down."
3.0,"This bracelet is really beautiful, but too thin. I’m afraid that it will easily bend and with wear it will break, so I am returning it; and I am sorry that I’m doing so."
3.0,"I needed this dress for my yoga teacher ceremony. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money so I was happy when I found this dress. I’m glad I got the  XL, I usually wear a m/l. This was perfect for what I needed it for, only downside was the dress is completely see through. I got it in white and you could see EVERYTHING. So needless to say I bought a slip that was more expensive then the dress lol"
3.0,"To be fair, it was probably my fault for not checking the size, but they jewelry was way smaller than I was expecting, and every time I put one in I almost can't get it out. The two clicker pieces are so hard to work with when they're that small, and my nose was sore for days. The two barbells are so small you can't screw the ends on without struggling for a while. Once any of the jewelry pieces are in they look really nice though. Just like the picture."
3.0,Go bigger when ordering
3.0,"I will say that overall I really like this swim suit. I am 162lbs, 5’6 and I ordered an xl. The shorts fit perfect but the matching top was a bit big under my bust but still fit overall. The tank top was the most problematic as it was gaping in the front armpit area. It didn’t look terrible but I am going to stitch the sides a bit. I would go with your normal size but expect that the tops might be too big. I bought this after seeing my friend wearing one but learned today that she had the same problems with sizing but had stitched her tops. There may be better ones out there but the design is really cute and I can make it work."
3.0,Buy two sizes larger than your size.  They run very small and I did not wash them yet.
3.0,Don't like the color.  Too bright orange. Photo looks darker.
3.0,I got a rash from this band
3.0,Love the color and design. Much better looking in person.  It does though fit a but tight around the shoulders and armpit area.  May be worth upsizing as long as the rest of the shirt doesn't get too big
3.0,As described but sent back very large for me
3.0,Buy a size up because mine is a little tight in some places
3.0,Mask very thin and runs small... one layer of polyester no available adjustment capability.
3.0,"This is a very nice bag.  However, the picture makes it look WAY bigger than it is.  I can get my laptop and one thin writing pad in it with a wallet and some writing utensils.  It is not okay as a carry all work bag. It is better suited as a purse or carrying a little work."
3.0,"I liked the look and design but extra large must be a large, once I put it on I need help getting it off."
3.0,I loved these and tried to wear them. I am 130lb 5 foot 1 inch and they were falling off😩
3.0,This was very heavy and when doing pottery too bulky.
3.0,Chest area loose and needs stichinh and I’m large breasted.<br />Love color
3.0,"EL ARTICULO ES DE BUENA CALIDAD PERO LA TALLA ES POCO PEQUEÑA, DEBERIAN ACTUALIZAR BIEN LAS TALLAS YA QUE NO CORRESPONDEN A LA DESCRIPCION DEL PRODUCTO"
3.0,Not worth the price. OK though. The logo was printed off-center on mine and the plastic parts feel cheap. Would not purchase again.
3.0,"This item fits my Pandora bracelet perfectly, and is quite lovely.  However, now that it is past the return window, I notice that it is constantly popping open, and I've nearly lost it a few times.  I literally found it the other day in my refrigerator, as it had fallen off my bracelet while I was moving things around on a shelf."
3.0,comfort good...it will do til I throw it out....
3.0,I’m 5’0and overweight.  This dress did not look great on me. I think the waist line is high and the skirt is longer.
3.0,"Nice shirts but the neck chest area is way too big it feels like a singlet, not my cup of tea. I’ve bought other shirts from this brand that are way better."
3.0,It's not the same product in the photos and different material all together. Not my favorite workout outfit ill be buying something else.
3.0,"These are really cute, but a bit too big for my face."
3.0,These look good but are not very supportive!
3.0,Very nice but came too big
3.0,Good product just not very comfortable to wear
3.0,They're alright but completely plastic so easy to scratch or break.
3.0,Very tight fit and hurts your ears after a while but I got a lot of compliments on them
3.0,"I really wish I would have seen the additional pictures when you scroll down on the main page with the model wearing the sweater untucked. It's much shorter than I expected, almost like a crop top on me with my large bust. I have a large bust plus a long torso, so I can't tuck it like the model does. It's not flattering on me. It seems well-made and lightweight; not really a warm sweater."
3.0,If you are purchasing these mask because of the Covid 19 then DO NOT.  They are meant for dust which means they are very thin.
3.0,the dress it self has to have something underneath it but it is a cute dress
3.0,Well made product.  This shirt was a bit large on me.  I will wear it for everyday.  I got a good deal on it and feel but do not think it will be a favorite thing for me to wear.
3.0,Seems to be turning already and I just took it out the box!
3.0,It looks a bit cheap.
3.0,Cute socks but thin
3.0,They look small and the red color starting wearing off the day I received my order
3.0,"I wore it with shorts because it is really short (I’m 5.7) and it was really cute. However, the flowery dress already bubbled up front and looks like I’ve worn it 20 times, when in fact I only wore it once and it hasn’t even been washed. Bummer, because the cut is really flattering."
3.0,I do not like the way that they fit.  Very small and not enough space/coverage.
3.0,"This is as advertised as a ""sweatshirt"", but it's actually a long sleeve t-shirt. It's really oversized-ended up giving it to my husband."
3.0,even tho these were XXL.  Still too small for my husband's size 13 feet
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  It's very long and drags and is a very bright red, not at all like what is pictured.  Velvet texture is also pretty low quality feeling."
3.0,Ended up returning. It was &#34;nice&#34; but not 20 something dollars nice. I love jewelry and am always willing to pay a little more for better quality.
3.0,"First of all, if you plan to order this be sure you have a ball or something round to stuff inside the hat to remake the shape. It came smushed and wrinkled. It arrived the day before my husband was going to wear it, had to give it so much attention to make it look the way it was supposed to! The hat makes the outfit so I'd hope it would come in better condition. Suspenders were fine, glasses pretty small. He left them home and grabbed a pair of work sunglasses he already had."
3.0,The dress was comfortable and would have been cute if the fabric didn’t bunch at the waist. I needed a larger size for my hips and bust but I have a small waist. I just couldn’t get the midsection fabric not to bunch and look frumpy
3.0,i bought the green one and they send me the black one and its too expensive to send it back if you can help me here i would appreciate it
3.0,At first I thought they were to cheaply made to even be worn but I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and I actually like them. There not super comfortable but at the same time my feet don't hurt. They are also not meant for keeping your feet warm. They are just cute and stylish and I have gotten a lot of compliments on them. I would not pay this price for them either.
3.0,"These wraparound sunglasses have features that would be good for sports, but not for me. They wrap around very well so there's no light coming in from the sides. The top of the glasses frame has a projection, made of a soft rubber or silicone,  that extends from the glasses to your forehead at or just above the eyebrows. That means there's no light infiltrating from above. The lenses are UV-protected and polarized.<br /><br />These would be good for playing baseball/softball or cycling where it would even prevent wind from hitting your eyes because of the extension. I found it annoying as it would grab my eyebrow hairs a little as I moved my brows. Not enough to pull them, just was an annoying feeling."
3.0,"Very comfortable shoe, however after everyday wear for a month the shoes are cracking across the top. Perhaps choose a shoe that doesn't have the glossy finish."
3.0,Glasses are stylish and extremely light. I found the size of the lens a little small for a larger oval shaped face. They do tend to slide down with the usage.
3.0,The gloves are not as good as I thought. They rip easily and do not hold up well. I bought a Case of them so have to use them but will look some where else for a different brand
3.0,didn't like the amount of stretch in material.  Doesn't fit all that well
3.0,It was soft the design was as expected but the fit was odd on me and it was big enough to do what it was suppose to do which was be off shoulder on one side
3.0,"The colors and fit are great. As other have said, the material is very light weight. Definitely more for looks than the function of warmth. The smell of it was/Is HORRID. It smells of chemicals and therefore I will not wear it. I’ve washed it (no joke) 8 times with vinegar, Lavender, scent pellets, etc. Scent isn’t as strong as it was when I removed it from package but still too strong to wear. I’ll leave it outside once it stops snowing and see if fresh air helps."
3.0,So scratchy. So scratchy.
3.0,Runs extremely small<br />Sheer as all get out
3.0,"My wife likes this bag, it has ample storage and it is made out of what appears to be a durable material so far. But she liked it better in the pictures online. In person, it seems a little more... I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but maybe ""cartoony"" would be appropriate. It would probably go better with kids/teenagers. It just doesn't give the same impression in person as it does in the pictures, especially for adult use.<br />Otherwise, it is a good bag in all other respects."
3.0,"Cute but too small.  Ordered size 4, but we shared with good will, when they didn't fit."
3.0,"Its such a beautiful dress style but arms are uncomfortably tight. If you have big arms, which I do for my overall size., this is a difficult dress to fit into. There is no stretch to the arms at all . I bought a Large (it fit loose on my body ) and altered the arms. I bought additional silver metallic tassle on Amazon adding to arm area to make it work.  I wear a medium shirt 5/6 in pants. size 36 D."
3.0,Dislike the fabric but the fit is good. I like that they are high waisted but will just wear them occasionally not as a regular in my work wear wardrobe.
3.0,The quality of the dress was good but the length is about 7 inches from my ankle. Was hoping for floor length. I am 6’2
3.0,"It was cute but, too big so I returned it. It has kind of a rubbery feel"
3.0,For work but they was a little big for me but I still used them
3.0,Plastic fabric like for kids Halloween costume.  Tight around upper arm. Longer than 34 size arm length.  It was OK for the price.
3.0,"It was very pretty, and my daughter loved it. The only draw back was the clasp broke after she wore it once. We fixed it but I thought it would at least last longer than one wearing. It was cheap so too get what you pay for."
3.0,"Bought this in a size small, but unfortunately I don't have to bosom to fill it. Might be abetter fit for someone else, but if you're as lacking of a chest as I am I wouldn't bother. I'm a 32B by the way. Might be better for someone with a C/D cup"
3.0,Way to tight and short for size. Not stretchy or soft.  Pretty colors though. May have to try a couple sizes up if available.
3.0,Looking at this pictures seems the dress is dark however when I got it it looks more white and faded would have ga e it a 5 star  I and 250 5’4 and got a 2x and fits good.
3.0,Other than the plastic pieces on the side
3.0,Ehh... Cheap tie but long for a big guy
3.0,No elasticity band
3.0,"I was excited to see compression socks that weren't a solid color.  The excitement stopped quickly after I put on the first pair.  Compression socks by design should provide even gentle compression while you're wearing them.  Anyone who wears compression socks knows that sometimes they're a bit more work to get up over your calf than a regular pair of socks.  They have to be this way to perform their job.  However, in the short time I've had  these, two of the six pairs have already torn while putting them on.  I love the style and the escape from solid colors and theyare comfortable while wearing, but for me, these fall short of my expectations for durability."
3.0,"It's pretty, but it runs small"
3.0,good for working out
3.0,The boots are super cute. They fit as expected and the quality of the leather is nice. I especially like the simple design without any extra decoration. My complaint is with the soles. The sole in one of the boots came loose the first time I wore them. I was at work so I had to walk around uncomfortably for the rest of the day. The glue also stuck to my sock. I will have to buy new soles and replace them. Minor issue but still inconvenient.
3.0,Does run a little small. Luckily I ordered a second style of dress that fits perfectly.
3.0,"These are much heavier than I expected and I ended up taking them off after about 10 minutes of wearing them. The extra weight from the clip made it difficult to walk. Not sure if placement on my shoe would have changed how I felt. They are very pretty & very easy to use. I am also not used to wearing heavier shoes, so that could made a difference."
3.0,All great except you'll never keep the digital settings correct due to the buttons constantly being accidentally pushed on account the stick out a mile and super easy to push
3.0,This is not as beautiful as the picture.
3.0,"The boots looked great, but the toe is much too narrow. I wore them at work (so I could walk around on carpet) and after about two hours they didn't pinch my feet as much, but I ended up returning them. They cost too much for me to say, Well, my feet don't hurt quite as much now."
3.0,DEMASIADO GRANDE.
3.0,"Arms too long, overall length was too long and the buttons were cheap."
3.0,quality of leather is not that good
3.0,Large is relative.  They did not see my large head I guess.
3.0,"No blue gem on dress, wand was broken. Really cheap accessories. Could have bought at the dollar store."
3.0,If you have to get in and out of a vehicle with this on in inclement whether you might have some problems but otherwise it works
3.0,Estalla chica y aún a si me queda demasiado grande y no soy delgada. Yo soy de talla mediana
3.0,Got my my house super fast. But I did not expect the fabric to be like it was. I thought it would be more silky the more of a fabric. But it's long and the holder for the keys I know will not break might like my last one. Good product
3.0,"Although billed as ""wicking"" and it definitely better than cotton, not sure I like the feel of the fabric. It tends to get pullies, as well."
3.0,"I got this kit for my daughter’s birthday party. I like it and it’s cute, but the description is misleading. It reads serves 15 but, when I recieved the box, it only had settings for 6. That is what I was disappointed about."
3.0,I really liked the  dress it’s what I expected
3.0,"Live in Chicago, it's pretty warm for single digit Fahrenheit. Fingers are a bit bulky to use touch screen, makes texting a bit difficult."
3.0,"I had to buy something for a Flapper party so this looked good. When it arrived in a little envelop I had to laugh. It looked like a little black chicken feather drooping from a cheap black band. I'd save my money and look elsewhere unless you are a little girl playing ""dress up"". Even then..."
3.0,"The dress is very nice and snug. It does not flare out as the picture at all! And the layer under is sewed to the zipper so even if you try to wear it with a petticoat it will still not flare out. The material is not see through and the style is very nice. The back fits a bit longer then the picture, but i believe that's more based on your height. I would wear this dress, but unfortunately it was not suitable for it's intended purpose."
3.0,It was nice but there was some white powder on the apron and it looked returned
3.0,Very cute nose rings.. but they keep getting pulled out while sleeping!
3.0,While I like the design I wouldn't recommend buying it. The pin back as others have stated is at the bottom. Only useful as a collectible or if you have a jeweler fix it.
3.0,I'm reading it with three stars due to one of the sets color do not match.
3.0,Very thin on the fabric. Does not hold up to normal use.
3.0,It a bit hard the material
3.0,"The romper fit true to size, if anything it ran slightly large. The fabric is stretchy, so you can expect some wiggle room in the size and the shorts are a pretty long length, you will not have any cheek hanging out in these. The big downfalls were how itchy and cheap feeling the fabric was and the design of the top. The ties are very long and the fabric area for the chest is small, not for big chested girls."
3.0,"Material flimsy, almost looks and feels like a gown.  Got the army green and it was an ugly grass green.  At your own risk!!!"
3.0,Thanks  the rings was to small but is OK .like it.
3.0,"They got holes in the toes pretty fast.  I was disappointed.  Also, a bit short, my ankle would get rubbed raw on runs over 2 hours."
3.0,The dress got a pick and hole in it.  Material is not very durable.
3.0,Beautiful color and style but sizing is not accurate. I usually wear a small but I was drowning in this.
3.0,Loved the print. I wore it to work where I have an office job and as the day wore on I could see the color fading and material making tiny beads. I’m disappointed it didn’t have greater durability. It should not have looked like an old dress by the end of the day.
3.0,Hit and miss on the sizing
3.0,"This bathing suit  fits just as expected. I like it all much, I took it on vacation. Received many compliments."
3.0,Shipment was fast and the necklace was good but the necklace was really short almost like a choker.
3.0,its a very short scarf.
3.0,"Decent glasses but does not change color in any way, as advertised. Not too happy about that but the glasses are ok. I would buy something else if I needed glasses again. I use them for motorcycling and the lenses seem of low quality because they often fog up."
3.0,I liked the dress overall but the bust area was too small could not zip up. 5 ft 3 inches 160 # normally wear a medium ordered a large.  Length was also an issue
3.0,"Dissapointed. When I purchased this shoe, most of the photos, (including th eone I clicked to choose the color) contain a strap. The large photo shows no strap. I took this to mean I would be getting the strapped shoe. No strap. Really dissapointed, since this makes the shoe ""annoying"" and ""floppy"" according to my child. Don't understand why crocs would make a child's clog without a strap, especially for the slippery winter months."
3.0,was missing a screw when i received them.....
3.0,Returning . I received it without straps .
3.0,I wear a medium in dresses. I purchased a large and it was still very tight. For reference I'm 5'3 and around 140.
3.0,Beautiful dress but has a huge hole in the seam around the waist. 😭 Hate that.
3.0,Sleeves to tight &#62; need an XXLarge Large is a med.
3.0,"Put this on my jacket that I received during my tenure in my AFJROTC program in high school, wore it during high school, really cool pin however, the size was no bigger than a quarter. However still a cool pin and look, and displays one of our fighting forces nicely. Doesn't scratch easy or break."
3.0,"The bangle bracelets are horrible.  The coating on them was not done well which makes them very, very scratchy.  Can only use maybe 4 out of the 15.  They charms, however, are great!  You get 3 of each, which pretty good.  They are well made."
3.0,Keychains are nice and sentimental but discoloration is prone to happen.
3.0,"The shirt has potential, but fits a little smaller than expected. Otherwise it's a very cute shirt."
3.0,"I own another Lspace one-piece swimsuit and assumed i would be the same size in this one. This suit fit much smaller and was tight around the leg openings (disclaimer: I am rather pear-shaped). Also, the nude mesh paneling on this black suit is weird. It looks too much like I'm naked. maybe the white suit would look better with the white panels. Regardless, love this brand and will try again when I find another suit I like."
3.0,"soft,flexible and the slots for any mask style are  great,but....i,sadly,had to return this item because it is much too small...after much searching on amazon i did find another bracket,different style but larger"
3.0,"Pretty, dainty and light weight, but much smaller than the picture. I them away to a friend."
3.0,"Scratches very easy, really disappointed.would not reccomend this product to anyone."
3.0,"Cute and great for the price. Kind of a cheap suede material but you can’t really tell except on close inspection. Comfortable for my 1 year old. Stays on well but also easy for parents to remove when they need to. Soft sole, not ideal for rocky/pokey ground. Also slides easily on slick surfaces. Good for most places though."
3.0,Very thin material. Stretches easily. After one wear it had to be retired to my &#34;wear at home&#34; draw.
3.0,OK quality. Runs a bit small.  But liked enough not to bother to send back.
3.0,Very long and boxy
3.0,My wife is happy with the fabric pattern.  She is somewhat disappointed that the interior only has 3 slip pockets instead of the 5 in most of the other Turnlock Satchel handbags.  And there is no outer zipper compartment on the back of the handbag.  I think the differences should have been listed in the description.  Maybe this one was a second but not listed as such.
3.0,Love the pattern and size of the bag but it arrived with several &#34;dirty&#34; spots on it. The strap is also short even when fully extended and so sits weird when wearing as a cross body.
3.0,This one’s extremely large I bought it for my 11-year-old niece and I bought a size 10/12 And it looked like a women’s large
3.0,"These workout shirts are just okay for the price, I guess.  I did notice that after the first wash, a couple of them showed signs of pilling.  Also, they don't breathe that well so if you do work up a sweat, it tends to stay on the shirts.  But just okay for the price."
3.0,Came in a nice box. Has a few marks on it but its okay.
3.0,"I caught these on sale and thought I'd try them out. I love the color and they feel nice and cool, but they are extremely thin. I am afraid that if they snag on something, they might rip right off me. I might wear them under a black skirt or walking around my house alone, but they cannot be worn in public without cover. You can see everything. They somehow feel loose and tight at the same time. I'm still trying to figure that one out."
3.0,A little big I wear a size 6 wish I got a 5 to fit prefect
3.0,All areas fit great except the crotch length is TOO SMALL/SHORT. I’m not sure of the technical term but the length from the waist to where the actual legs begin. I’m returning them for that reason.
3.0,The inside isn’t as soft as expected in the arms. It’s very thin & lightweight. Although the fit is great & I love it for a quick top to throw on over a tank or t-shirt.
3.0,"Why does this watch band need to be so stiff? I've been wearing it for three weeks now, and it still hasn't broken in to fit my wrist comfortably. I guess that's why it was so deeply discounted."
3.0,It was a good product.  I carried it to work and my keys ended up poing a hole in it two weeks later.
3.0,I would suggest to get one size smaller it is loose fit!!!
3.0,These are thin and do not fit very well. They slide off of my kid's noses when they talk and need constant readjustment.  They are 8 and 11. The colors are fun. But that's the only +. I won't be purchasing them again and would not recommend them.
3.0,"Large, eye catching and colorful brooch. I would have loved it if it didn't have a missing stone. 😕 Just FYI other shoppers, it is really big! So if you are looking for a small, subtle piece of jewelry, this is not it. This is definitely a statement piece!"
3.0,"I'm a big fan of Pediped and hoped to find the same quality in Momo brand, but they didn't compare. Shoes were returned."
3.0,"It is pretty, but it does not stretch. The description is incorrect."
3.0,I love the product. The listed waist sizes are not accurate.. mine was a little to small && one of the wires came out on day one
3.0,It's ok thought it was thicker
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter to be a ring bearer in my sister's wedding, while it's cute it's very see through. My daughter wears a torso cast to treat her scoliosis and her orange cast was quite visible through the material. Otherwise, it's a decent dress."
3.0,Dive watches are a really cool style but you have to know the line between waterPROOF and water RESISTANT. Once water got it it went to heck and I just got another watch. Still it got several complements and was nice while it lasted.
3.0,We are not able to set the hour in time. We can set everything else but it the hour blinks and doesn't change numbers.
3.0,"Arrived on time and in great shape. Love the shirt, However it was way too small for it's original target.  We did find a smaller body to use it on so we kept it."
3.0,Lovely dress but the armholes are too small to the point of being uncomfortable. I am only 5'4&#34; x 125 lbs...my arms are not flabby.
3.0,"I was excited to get this for my fiance but was sad to see it is so small.<br />That's my fault I'm sure there are measurements somewhere. It's about a third of the size of a normal shoulder sling messanger backpack. Leather is real and good quality, seems durable to elements, and all in all can hold quite a few knock knacks if that's what you're looking for. Over all I was impressed with the design but disappointed by the size, minimal storage,  and theoices of leather treatment."
3.0,Too tight in some areas. But still a nice product.
3.0,They were very pretty and perfect for my grandfather's funeral. But the stars came off a bunch of them.
3.0,"They're cute buuuuuuut I can't put them in. even with youtube tutorials etc. stood there in the bathroom mirror, concentrating fiercely, struggling and sweating. No go. But maybe one day..."
3.0,I love the design but the metal is losing it;s color :(
3.0,"I loved the style of the socks, unfortunately I was unable to wear them.  I was putting them on and they tore so I don't think they would have worked for me...which is a disappointing since I have to wear support socks and I am so tired of black and white only options."
3.0,"I ordered the 3/4 sleeve Christmas tree sweater dress, and it is much more baggy than I expected. I'm 5'6"" 160lbs, wear size 8 or so usually, and I ordered Medium. I knew it would fit loosely based on the photos, but it hangs off me like a sack. It is vaguely A-line shaped, comes in slightly at the waist, but not nearly enough. The sleeves fit perfectly though, so I think I can salvage it with a belt."
3.0,"this was retuned.  tracking number1z30033a9040042476 on june,6,2019.  I have not been accredited for on my account."
3.0,Not even close to being a sweater. More like a shirt.
3.0,I wanted to love this set but the sizing was insane. The mask was far too small for my 9 year old daughter and pinches her head and the slippers are slightly too big for me at size 8.5 womens. I wish this came in a children's sized set and that the elastic on the mask was longer!
3.0,"I haven't washed it yet, but I'm doubtful that it will survive the wash. It's rather small, even after taking into consideration the size difference for Americans versus Asian sizing. I would say, if you follow the sizing information, just go up one size. Then, you will have a bargain."
3.0,Several of them broke as I tried to put them on.
3.0,Fit too small. Returned and witheld an exchange. Go ahead and order a size above I would guess.
3.0,This was a cute purse for a little kid which I used it for that purpose. While very cute it comes off as plastic which it is
3.0,Kind of small. Got a 3x
3.0,"I'm super bummed that this is not actually a scoop neck/boat neck/off the shoulder as pictured. It's very much a crew neck, and that's even with me sizing up for a looser fit. It's still a nice dress, and I'll probably get it altered rather than bothering to return it. But if, like me, you dislike crew necks and are specifically looking for what is in the picture, it's not what you'll get."
3.0,"dress is nice a bit big in the bust area, very flowy and great color. the back flap could use a hook or internal snap to hold it in place from moving around and making it look yucky but I will add that myself."
3.0,Comfortable but too big and the bottom part doesn't bell out like shown in the picture. More like a house coat.
3.0,"I was so excited when I saw this beanie but sadly the concept was cuter then the actual hat, at least on me. It was a bit too small for my head and not super obvious at first look what it was. It might be cuter on a child or someone without my mass amounts of long hair. I think it would also look better on someone with brown hair, mine clashed with the beanie and made the buns look even more out of place. Cute idea but I ended up returning it."
3.0,"I liked the colors of the tracksuit but the bottoms fit was bad. The bottoms were really tight around my thighs and buttocks to the point where I couldn't bend down or over without my underwear showing or feeling like I'm going to bust out of them. I'm a small woman, 5'1 in height, weigh 128lbs so having a small size shouldn't have been a problem. I wont be wearing the bottoms but i will wear to top. Top fits perfect."
3.0,Need to wear a bra with it.
3.0,"These are the cutest slippers. Unfortunately, the pair received seemed to be previously worn. (Alot). The strap across the foot was extremely wide. Which makes wearing them impossible. There were scuff marks on different parts of both shoe. But the design was cute and color was bright."
3.0,No to bad
3.0,"Very comfortable and like that it has a pocket.  However these are short for pants with a slight flare.  I’m 5’6 and these only come to just above my ankles, which means they look funny when I wear them with tennis shoes."
3.0,Never got to wear this...the material is very awkward.  Feels like a satin material so I didn't care for it too much.  Also bulky.  I love the pattern but don't recommend this top.
3.0,"I loved wearing this dress.  The material was soft and light, but not thin.  The colors/patterns were cute.  It would be comfortable to wear around town or traveling. I am returning the dress though because the style is not flattering, which surprises me because I usually like dresses with empire waists.  The dress fit correctly in the bust area, but the rest of dress made me look heavy.  Maybe it was the pockets or maybe there was too much material?  Bummer."
3.0,The crown is nice and fits well. Personally for my taste it was too big.
3.0,The bead was just a tiny bit cloudy.
3.0,I got a small and it wasn’t very form fitting. On the baggy side unfortunately. Not my favorite.
3.0,"Didnt care for the button sleeves and the elastic legs ..ended up cutting them off and hemming the sleeves and legs,,,now i love them"
3.0,We like the design and colors. The biggest disappointment was that after one wash the thread at the stitching has already pulled out. Yes I can fix it but I wouldn’t expect to after one wash.
3.0,EARRINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME SIZE AS THE PENDANT
3.0,Love the shirt and color. But  Unfortunately the sleeves were so long. Usually I can cuff them but it was still too long.  The shoulders didn’t fall on my shoulders either looks like it wasn’t made right. Way too big. I ordered my size and I have a big chest and still it was oversized.
3.0,"One was already broken, and the other broke when I was putting it on. I fixed the second one, but the first one didn't have the piercing part, so I couldn't put it in my ear. It's really nice to wear, but I wish the other one hadn't been broken."
3.0,bad qulity
3.0,"The suit was well made and the style was nice, however it’s not made for someone with a DD chest... would be ok for maybe C cup at the most. I guess it’s one of the downfalls of large busted girls!"
3.0,"My boys love CKN Toys. I purchased these in one size larger than they normally wear and actually wish I would have ordered two sizes up. They shrank considerably once washed and dried. For example, my son’s size 8 now fits him like a size 6. They still love the shirts, but I won’t get more than a season out of them with the sizing."
3.0,The ring came early which was great I got this for my mother she now had a mother’s ring and Grandma ring in one love it thank you
3.0,I wasn't expecting much for quality being as these are $2 a piece but I was most interested in the color and I know that different screens can make the color appear different but this was WAY different. Will not order again.
3.0,lays kind of funny over my bust.
3.0,The dress is more attractive once I cut off the colorful Fringe that did not match anything on the dress at all
3.0,COLOR WORE OFF TOO QUICK
3.0,Nice pattern and style. Top is a little big.<br />The fabric is thin. Overall worth the $10.
3.0,Hopefully you are buying this for a SLIM child. My daughter is 10 years old and she's kinda shapely. I brought the biggest size and laughed when I opened it. I will be returning this.
3.0,"It is great, and my kiddo loved it, but it is very thin and doesn't provide much warmth."
3.0,"Looks cheap (but we get what we paid for!), runs a little larger than expected, and is a little too thin/see-through.  It is exactly as shown: the flowers are pretty, and it doesn't have any support for the belly; is just the elastic waist band.  Not flattering at all.  Will keep it for home, but will not be wearing it outside or for working out."
3.0,"I wear medium, but ordered XL per the sizing chart recommendation. XL fits a little too loosely, L probably would have been a better fit."
3.0,The ties in the back don't tie down far enough it's only a couple holes so it doesn't hold them in place at all so basically u have the bottom half of your pants flapping all around it's annoying. 3 stars because it survived a wash and dry it's kinda soft and fit fairly as expected on the bigger/longer side and I am 5'9
3.0,"Spacious, and looks ok my problem is that it gets a bend in the middle of the bag when its not on your back and it make your bag look weird"
3.0,"REVISED: Although my review of the product is true, the seller was fast at offering a replacement for free. The seller seems great, so maybe I just got a defective item.<br /><br />I should have listened to the other bad reviews, but I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt..BUT It was broken when we received it!! It would wind, tick for a second and stop."
3.0,"This was a very cute tiara.  However, a piece on the top bent and broke right away.  I used it for my daughter anyways and she liked it a lot cause she likes a crown but doesn't like the headband style.  I just wish it wouldn't have broke so easily."
3.0,The pants does not fit like I wanted and they were not long enough. Very disappointing.
3.0,"Maybe mine was just a defect, but have to find a center silk tie to use easily.  Great material though."
3.0,Extremely light weight more so than expected. I really don't think this was meant for warmth at all.  Haven't used it in rain to test it out yet
3.0,"It is a nicer quality bag than I expected.  I know its synthetic or mixed leather, but it feels like fake leather.  I would say that is the major downside to the bag.  Otherwise, it is large enough to hold a great amount of stuff and perfect for a mom and or an office bag!  The straps are a nice size so it sits just below your armpit.  Overall it is a nice bag but I am not a fan of &#34;PU leather&#34;. I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion."
3.0,"non-rotating bezel is a major downside for me. Otherwise it's a nice looking, good quality automatic watch, fairly large, and gets noticed by others."
3.0,Its warm coat no doubt but material they used inside is cheap. All pockets have holes now.
3.0,"Very pretty but does not stay in, falls out. The first few times my son was able to find it for me, but that means it was gone within a week!"
3.0,Cute but is a lot shorter than I expected.
3.0,Mask smells bad!!!
3.0,"I didn't like it, too fake looking. These wigs look like dirty homeless person hair. Not just this one; I hated all the wigs I purchased from online. So it is up to you."
3.0,This purse looks better online but was too small for my needs. It’s a pretty purse but the side  pockets are too small for a smartphone or wallet so everything is getting placed in the main compartment which causes clutter. I was hoping to avoid cluttering with this purse but was disappointed. Has two awkward handles that get in the way when using the shoulder strap. The material is sturdy and I had no issues with rips or tears. Fast shipping. This purse would be much better if the pockets were a few sizes bigger and the handle straps were removeable.
3.0,"sturdy hat, works for last minute costumes. but if u wanna look good on the real, you should invest in a $30 bowler hat cuz this only looks good in the dark. fits me real loose but i guess i kind of got a pinhead. if u are the red queen, yes get this hat. hide ur enormous noggin. but if u have a pimple of a head like me, be wary. only get this as a last resort."
3.0,"The kangaroo socks are not white, they look white with a print but they are actually grey.<br />I wear a size 9 shoe and the large is pretty big, I should of ordered small size"
3.0,ETA: the romper is a bit small on my little guy. Als notice a hole on one of the lefs :(<br /><br />Super cute romper! Lightweight and can be worn summer too!
3.0,Dress was nice but came very small
3.0,"The material sheds like a golden retriever. It’s SO soft and I get nothing but compliments on the style but my jeans, car, and office are covered in purple fuzz even after washing. Just be warned!"
3.0,Like the colors. I just wish they come in different sizes as they do shrink.
3.0,Transaction was great but product materials were not as expected.  One of the drawbacks of not being able to touch something before you buy.
3.0,The dress looks better in the picture
3.0,Nice shoes but heel height is much higher than posted and should have gotten half size smaller
3.0,Cute coat. The color has a yellow tint to it versus a tan/khaki. Also it does run big. I ordered a small and still have quite a bit of room in it. Debating on returning the coat.
3.0,It just didn't suit my needs.
3.0,Very dark. Can barely see anything with these on.
3.0,Nice material and good coverage. But the crotch seems to not have enough elastic. They tend to get loose throughout the day and I don’t like things falling out.
3.0,Go 1-2 sizes up.
3.0,"The material was nice, but these were at least a size too big and very wide. I sent them back, rubbed against my ankles too hard."
3.0,"Came pretty fast, sad it didn't fit as expected! I ordered an XXL and it fit more like a large compared to other brands that I normally by and way (like old navy, target, etc). Happy with the shipping speed. I assumed it to be more of a flowy dress like pictured but it is super clingy like a stripper or night club dress. But quality looks nice and feels nice. Will probably sell it to a friend so I don't have to pay to return it."
3.0,"There seem to be two types of fabric at Homeyee - thin polyester and thick cotton blend.  I hate the former and love the latter.  This dress is made of the latter.<br />The dress is flattering skimming the body with enough stretch for movement.<br />I bought both colorways and decided to keep the one with black on top and white on bottom.  Alas, when I washed it in cold water on the delicate cycle, the white fabric at the bottom became yellow.  So both ended up being returned."
3.0,"Fit really well around calf but fit small around ankles. The toe part is what I didn't like about them, the seam irritated me all day. Only wore once but I liked the color."
3.0,It's cozy but didn't have an buttons
3.0,CHeaply made
3.0,"Unless you want this to fit fitted, I recommend going up two sizes.  I ordered a ex large for comfy, pants were okay, but top fits like a large.  Tight and shorter sleeves"
3.0,"These are nice slippers. Quality is good. I have fallen arches and plantar fasciitis. I am learning that I have extra high fallen arches. And also need something with a higher ""heel"" or life in the back. These are quite flat. And they weren't padded enough on the sole for my needs. There is a nice arch support in the foot bed. Just wasn't the right slipper for my tootsies."
3.0,It is the second time that I buy them and they arrive broken
3.0,I ordered this dress in a Large for a 50s party but it was way too small.  I gave it to a friend and it fit her perfectly.  She was the hit of the party!!
3.0,"Really nice, but cheap fabric."
3.0,What is to be expected for the price.
3.0,IT'S VERY GOOD FOR A MASK TO WEAR FOR  SHORT PERIODS OF TIME  NATURALLY  IS NOT  LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN  BUT  WILL DO  THE JOB  NOT FOR CHILDRENS  IT GETS  HOT
3.0,I bought this SHERPA coat for a trip to Alaska and it is definitely NOT warm enough for my trip - but it is very cute so U kept it
3.0,"Cute product, too loose"
3.0,they just run super small they’re really nice material but make sure you size up a ton
3.0,It’s to bulky and hard to breathe
3.0,"I bought the size suggested, I should have gone a size smaller and then maybe it would be compression. The size the product suggests is not just a under tank."
3.0,"The fit on this is great when I went with my preferred size of a large. I like to be able to move and sometimes T-shirts can shrink a bit. I went with a large at 5'7"" and 140 lbs. I'm a 36B, with a 34 jean waist, although my backside is around 40-42 inches at the widest part for a peach shape. The shirt as a color and the print are meh, though. The print is not black, but a faded and washed out medium gray. It's hard to capture. It looks like it's been washed too much. The shirt is also not a medium gray, but a rather light gray color that's a few steps up from white. When light hits it, it's hard to tell from the flash, but it's just overall washed out. It feels comfy, but not what I was expecting. I wouldn't get this one again. Colors aren't vibrant."
3.0,"Big, big, big. Very big fits my whole chest I like, but my husband said &#34;No its to big&#34;. I knew it was big but not as big.....I'm keeping it. Maybe,I can wear it on date night in fall or winter weather and not look like a clown."
3.0,"LOVED this for my oldest niece for Christmas, but when it arrived it was barely iridescent as pictured. There was a slight hint of color on a very black base. The geometric textural design was still really cool, and this is a girl who does like black so it worked out anyways. However, the pictures really should reflect the actual product better. I was so excited for the ""luminous"" iridescent effect!"
3.0,"The top is nice, not as long as the picture, and  a little more on the pink side than what is shown.  Overall a decent top"
3.0,These look awesome!  But unfortunately I couldnt get them in.  They say 18g but thats what my ears have been for 15 years and these sure wouldnt fit through.
3.0,"Love the print and really would have loved these, but they were way too small!  I bought the size I always wear (a medium) and could barely get them pulled on."
3.0,Will spend a little more for better pair next time. These feel cheap and look cheap.
3.0,Pretty with first wear but runs slightly small.  Does not wash well
3.0,"To uncomfortable to walk on, maybe is just me but I will be returning them."
3.0,"Looks great, love the style, but doesn't fit the Mi Fit 5 well."
3.0,I wear US size 3x.  Thus China 5x is too small.
3.0,"If you need something to get you by for like a ""one time thing"", these are for you! Not made well enough to last overtime."
3.0,I feel like the material is cheap for what I paid for it.  My daughter loved it.
3.0,"It's okay. I runs big and was baggy on me, which is probably why the neckline didn't sit too well. Otherwise, it appears to be quality material and I have washed it twice and it did well. The color looks just like the picture. It seemed to be a little longer on me too, but again maybe it was because it was too big."
3.0,"I have been loyal to the Aiko fit for years and I still love it. However- the material really is different and feels kind of cheap. Very elastic.  Not at all like the previous pairs I’ve had. I’ve only worn them a few times, so they might grow on me, but I was a little disappointed when I received them. Still a great fit."
3.0,"Like the style, but a little tight in the shoulders"
3.0,Ordered these for my husband a whole size up after reading reviews and they’re a very snug fit. He doesn’t have wide or fat feet so that’s not a factor for the snug fit.  He said he’ll keep them and hope that they’ll stretch out. I’d suggest going 2 - 3 sizes up.
3.0,"Very cute dress, fits (at least) a size larger than labeled."
3.0,"I'm 7 months pregnant and ordered this as a maternity dress. I got a medium and while the dress fit it looked more like a bath robe than an actual dress. Maybe it's just my size, but I looked like I was wearing a bath wrap."
3.0,I love orthaheel tide. I have several pairs.  I ordered 2 pairs of these and they are both on the small side.  I see others have had the same experience.
3.0,Adorable! Received lots of compliments! Only flaw is that the straps are Velcro.
3.0,"So initially I was a little apprehensive about getting this nose ring because corkscrew rings are so hard to put in. I prefer L-shape rings and that's exactly what I ended up doing to this ring. I find it quite difficult to find an L-shape ring with a big enough stud and that's why I opted for this ring. I ended up taking some pliers and reshaping the ring into an L-shape so that it was easier to install. It popped right in and doesn't look too bad. As far as the stud itself, I do wish that it was just a tad bit more flush against my nose but it's 3 mm so I'm not going to whine about that. I am not white so I have a thicker, more broad nose and this ring fits a little better than other rings made for thinner noses. Overall, I like it, just wish it wasn't a corkscrew shape and that the stud was fashioned a little better."
3.0,"Took forever to ship, fits like a floor length dress. My daughter is tall for her age and it drowns her."
3.0,Kinda tangles up when I try to put it on.  The fabric and construction is good quality.
3.0,"It would better if they display the wrist size, these beads are really made for a small wrist."
3.0,Fits snug but really long
3.0,crappy material but for the price it serves it's stay-at-home-with-dirty-hair purpose
3.0,tarnished and broke the same day
3.0,There really big
3.0,Vibrant colors and beautiful but way too small. Large fits like a medium.
3.0,"They are nice, received them quickly. However,  they run way larger than I expected so they don't fit ."
3.0,"I bought this because it got great reviews on being a good workout top; however, the material is kind of strange. It's very thick and scratchy to the touch, not ideal for working out. I would not be comfortable wearing this."
3.0,Not a bad little case however it does make pressing the power button a little fiddly.
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; tall and wear a 44D bra, (3/4X top).  I ordered the 48 C/D.  This bra, with the extender, is tight and the straps are too short.  This bra fits strangely.  I agree with other reviews that the cups have a conical shape, are padded and are very stiff.  But like the other reviews said, I think that will soften up with washings.  It does push your boobs together, it IS a pushup bra, and you do have to be careful how you place them in the cups, or you will end up with the uni-boob syndrome.  If you are not use to wearing a pushup bra, you may not like how it places your breasts more in the center of your chest.  This is normal for a push up bra.<br /><br />With all of that said, the bra is beautiful and is well made.  I love the details on the wide straps and the comfortable wide sides and back.  I hope that washing and some stretching with help this bra fit better.  However, I would recommend leaving this one to the thinner girls."
3.0,"The XL is a bit small; I am 6’ 220lbs with a muscular build.  The elastic on the sleeves and waist are annoying, the photos didn’t express such elastic.  I am returning the item."
3.0,"This is such a cute pin, but so small. We bought several designs and this one is so tiny compared to the others."
3.0,Its ok. Not bad or good.
3.0,"It is a bit small so it won't stay on with much movement beyond sitting.  I thought that the marble that is supposed to be in the mouth of the dragon was missing but discovered that it's there, but it's under the head and so not visible.  If you have very small ears this would be perfect."
3.0,did not fit with my case
3.0,Not a fan.  All you crazies who leave reviews about &quot;daily wear&quot;  and wore out after 10 events.... what kind of events do ya go.to &quot;daily&quot; where YA NEED FANGS!!!!
3.0,Could of been little biger
3.0,"I’ve used Alfani boxers exclusively and this set is too tight, I don’t even wear them .."
3.0,"Ring us very pretty in the box, very smooth, very shiny! BUT after about 2 weeks of wear it is very dull, and gouges and scratches very easy. I would look for something else if you have the time and money!"
3.0,Good product but runs a little small
3.0,Bolt was out of one of them and is coming undone
3.0,Shoes not true to stated size.  Had to return them
3.0,There isn't a whole lot of pad but they look well made
3.0,The face protector did not come with the watch band
3.0,This runs small. I wear a woman’s small and got the XL in this shirt and it’s a little bit tight.
3.0,"Cute, ran a bit large in the crotch. Was fine for the money."
3.0,I do really like this wallet and it's super cute!! :) So in love with the color. Just as pictured and smooth material. Only thing is not the best if you have a lot of cards (won't really double card a slot which is what my old wallet did). It's also very hard to get the cards out of the slots (not very roomy at all) especially the license slot. What I did was use the money area to keep extra cards in for easy access. Does get stuffed easily but I overall still like carrying it around and using it.
3.0,"It is only the blade replacement, it does not include the top gear"
3.0,I didn't like the stone coming out of the holder so be careful when you wear it. A simple line of Super glue will do the trick! Still recommend!
3.0,"the box is nice and good to use as a gift to friend, i like the style, and the size is perfect for me, last it is worth 30 based on its quality."
3.0,"Fit is good,but not traditional sweat pants ."
3.0,Didn’t last for long
3.0,"Very pretty but this listing is deceiving: it's not flannel or any other thick fabric...it's more like a see through thick/stiffened chiffon and netting mix. Also the colors on the scarf material are pastel...not the jewel tones shown in the listing picture. So it's pretty, has good weight, and colors will still work with some of my costumes but definitely not what I was expecting. Haven't performed in it yet."
3.0,"Was great first use…comfortable bright light, used to walk dog at night to potty. Next night not so great, third night barely any direct light. Just a splash of light.<br />Wondering if needs a new battery.<br />Will do that then see…."
3.0,It was not as comfortable as I thought it would be.
3.0,Material was pretty good.  I guess it was a little awkward for me since I'm used to cottony fabric instead of satiny poly.  Pretty pattern though.  It was a much better look when I wore a tutu underskirt with it.
3.0,Runs a little small. About a half size small to be exact. Beautiful well made.
3.0,Seem to fit large but still nice cargos.
3.0,they ran small and are of poor quality
3.0,"The photo makes it look like a nice heavy ribbed cotton blend...it's a cheap, almost shiny, polyester. Very disappointed. I guess the fit was good, but sent it back."
3.0,"So this dress was a little larger than I expected, I got a medium and it’s loose on my 36” bust and 29” waist. It is also fairly seethrough. I had to sew in a lining at the top and will likely have to take it in. Still love the pattern and the pockets!"
3.0,Nice fitting bra but NOTHING high impact about it. Will wear for outdoor light activities.
3.0,"Perfect fit comfortable, I only wish material was higher quality. Material is too synthetic."
3.0,Its nice but it tarish fast. I have others and they haven't tarish. I but this on twice.
3.0,Wish I would have bought bigger-these are truly very small.
3.0,Really pretty material nice blouse  but I think they run on the small side =(
3.0,"Came with a hole. It’s soft, durable, beautiful color and material. Just didn’t appreciate the hole."
3.0,Good fit not very good compression. I have other socks that i wear for sports and those are tight. These are just meh. Was hoping for more. Like them as socks.
3.0,"Definitely not my favorite Minicat purse. It has a ton of pockets, which is great, but the strap is wider, and shorter than I'd prefer for crossbody wear. I have a more expensive Minicat purse that is extremely soft PU/vegan leather; it was incredibly comfortable to wear, and it would conform to the body, so, you could wear it constantly, and barely even notice it was there. It had a thin, long strap.  The downside was that the material was so thin and soft, the magnets tore through. This bag is not the same material. It does seem more durable, but again, not nearly as comfortable to wear. The positives are the pockets...the front pocket under the flap, is perfect for a cellphone. The back zipper pocket, is perfect for a thin wallet, and the two side zipper pockets are perfect for small items that you would like quick access to, such as chapstick, or keys.<br /><br />5 stars for the pockets<br />2-3 stars for the material and weight<br />2 stars for the strap<br /><br />Once you go extremely light, comfortable, soft, with a thin, very long adjustable strap, and get used to the convenience of crossbody wear, it's very difficult to go back to anything else. With all of that said, sadly, this was a step down for me. It's not a terrible purse, especially for the price, but it's not as good as others that they have released, and quit making. That's probably my biggest pet peeve with Minicat, they release some really great bags, then once they sell out, they quit making them, and make completely new designs. Bummer."
3.0,"For starters, I like the ring, don't get me wrong. It looks nice and fits well... But it wasn't what I was expecting. The picture is VERY misleading. I thought it would be matte and more angular (like some sort of metal)  like it was in the picture, but instead it's round and shiny (like glass??) I still like the ring, but I was expecting something different."
3.0,La calidad del set de ropa está súper bien pero el pantalón no es el tamaño que lo pedí queda super pegado. Hasta dejarte si aire literal. Pero la camisa si está bien de tamaño pero el pantalón no. Pero la calidad está bien.
3.0,"I love the simplicity of this belt and the added length on this model. Unfortunately, they also made it slightly too wide, so it's kind of a pain to thread it through the loops or remove on most pants. Also, I think it would be good to have a silver colored plastic option for the buckle is instead of straight black."
3.0,Pretty comfortable.  One pair came with a hole in one of the seams
3.0,"These are almost pure cotton and the weave is very soft.  There is a bit of elastin in it for fit.  These are comfortable to wear.  Also, when you take them out of the envelope box (which is a cute idea) I thought these are not crew sock but full over the calf socks but for my size 12 feet, they are the perfect crew length.<br />The following are some of the issues I have with these socks:<br />There is not enough elastin so the socks creep down a bit or roll up at the top.<br />With one pair of socks they got a pull in the foot catching on something in the shoe (never had this happen before but suspect the weave being the cause)<br />While the pattern is nice, most of the fun part is on the foot, which is not seen when wearing shoes.  If you like running around in your socks at home this might be a better use of the sock design.<br />Overall, not bad but also not great"
3.0,"I like the fabric and the style, but it's way too small on me. Order a size or two up from your normal size."
3.0,I just received my wallet today and the first time I opened it the inside stuck together and ripped away the material
3.0,"This sweater runs small and super shrinks even in cold water. This is THE WORST with lint, it's a magnet and it's kind of scratchy"
3.0,"Nice hat, but medium is smaller than typical. May want to order a large instead."
3.0,Beautiful dress!!! So soft too!!!<br />But it showed allll the problem areas.. I am 5'7 and 185lbs.<br />I am sadly returning.
3.0,"I am glad I read the reviews and ordered 2-3 sizes big. I am 125lb 5'7"" with side B cup.<br />Generally i wear US size small or medium.<br />I ordered XL. Fits great!!. It's a beautiful chic shirt. would have liked tighter waistline, but a size smaller will be too tight in chest area.<br /><br />After wearing it out one day, I noticed the sticking on sleeves is coming off. I repaired it, but somewhat dissappointed."
3.0,Not very compressive and unicorns are not squat proof.  returned
3.0,they slide down when walking
3.0,The sizing is not correct
3.0,Fit seems small and it's not very forgiving. The print did not match the pictures as advertised
3.0,I really wanted to love this sweater! But unfortunately it was sized weird and fit too small. I normally wear a medium but the sleeves were too short and so was the length. I decided to return instead of going up (probably would have ordered an XL). Super cute pattern tho! Just a weird fit.
3.0,"I put these in my snow skiing back pack so I could remove my boots and walk around the ski lodge during lunch & hot beverage breaks.  They are very flat & compact and wonderful for that.  BUT I would never buy them for grandpa!  The elastic around the ankle and, in general, the upper is very 'loose.'  It is VERY easy to slide your feet out of these.  I got into the habit of removing them by simply placing my foot flat on the floor and just sliding my foot backwards.  Your fool will effortlessless slip out.  Not sure they should be quite so easy to remove if you have stability issues!"
3.0,"Beautiful dress, great material and quality but no stretch or give on the top for top heavy ladies"
3.0,Only washed these 3 times and the seams are already coming apart!! Not a very good buy!! They are definitely comfortable but wont last long!!
3.0,"Is not true to size, but if u size up it will be very long... material is thin and see through"
3.0,gave to my granddaughter to small
3.0,"They'll do. They didn't cost much, so they are cheap."
3.0,"I bought this in dark green, it’s cute and fits well but despite washing it it is wrinkled. I hesitate to hang to dry because it might stretch out too much but I will give it a try and see if this smoothed out the wrinkles, I’m doubtful. The material is soft but thin and tends to show body “rolls” a little more than I’d like, but I still plan on wearing it around the house if the wrinkles are an issue."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress, but it's a bit too small for size labeled (US).  It's short as it hits at the top of the knee (I'm 5'6&#34;).  The hemline is very uneven and poorly stitched.  I would have given it a higher rating if it was a bit longer in length, more care was given to hemline stitch and waistline was a bit longer.  But I somehow made it work for the occasion."
3.0,gold edging has turned dark and un-noticable  But this is better than the one the saying peeled off of.
3.0,Not just a little too small. Even used tape measure to get daughters size. Had no time to reorder or return. Had to add extra strip of material sewn into crotch area to make it longer.
3.0,"There are a lot of nice things to say about this product, but it's hardly worth the accolades that some reviewers seem so eager to award it. I wear shirt stays in my professional life after having worn them for years of military school and service. Unevenly tucked shirts in the workplace are unsightly in my opinion.<br /><br />Knowing that, I sought to replace my last pair of stays with something that would stand up to the rigors of constantly getting in and out of cars, standing up and taking a seat to shake hands, or get something from the printer. Shirt stays are only necessary when you're transitioning from a seated position or bending over.<br /><br />For these purposes the clasps on the Buttons & Pleats Advanced Stays were lacking. The nylon clips do not have enough strength to hold a shirt. The system relies on the clip snagging the bottom seam of your shirt, rather than actually grabbing on to the material. This is misleading, because the clips actually have teeth, giving you the impression that they clamp on to the shirt where you clip them. Rather, they will slide down until they hopefully (but not always) grab onto the thin roll of the seam towards the bottom of your shirt.<br /><br />While this has the potential to be good enough for many people just desiring a simple tucked shirt, it makes it near impossible to execute a thumb roll/shirt tuck. Therefore unless you're wearing custom tailored shirts you probably shouldn't rely on these.<br /><br />The ribbed elastic is every bit as high quality as the company promises. It feels sturdy in the hand and I can see years of use. However, it is not as soft as the description would have you guess. I have sensitive skin and wear shirt stays often. I have a 6 dollar pair from the service that lasted me ten years before the elastic finally blew out. I never had to take them off because of the rubbing. The elastic, as robust as it is, is also very abrasive.<br /><br />The actual buckles on the shirt stays may contribute as well. Hard plastic, like the kinds you would expect to find on a backpack. Very durable, yet overkill for shirt stays.<br /><br />All considered I think these would be very suitable for people in an office with basic shirt tucking needs. However some of the reviews I see about police officers using them go a bit to far in promising a reliable tuck in all conditions. Mine generally pop after a good staircase or two."
3.0,"The outside breast pocket is not a pocket, just look like only."
3.0,It’s a decent shirt but not well made. Lots of stray threads to be trimmed and had to be careful they weren’t holding the garment together. Wasn’t impressed with the ruffles had to really work on them to get them to look close to the photo
3.0,"So I reallllly wanted to fall in love with this product & don't get me wrong it's super adorable but it just isn't what I was expecting. I've gotten lolita kimono costumes in the past & have never had a bad experience but the sizing seemed so off in this outfit.<br />The fabric itself feels and looks beautiful, truly I do love that aspect of it.<br />I usually wear a small but got a medium just to be safe & I still felt like every inch of my curves were trying to pop out when I moved (I weight 120 pounds).<br />I used an obi from an old kimono set because I got tired of fighting with the one it came with.<br />The bows are also very pretty but you have to work with them a bit or they sorta of just hang.<br />I ended up using my other kimonos skirt under this one for a more puffy appearence which I prefered.<br />I originally got this for a character creation I was making for a con but after spending a week altering the outfit I decided to do something else & just finish the outfit later.<br />Overall it is cute & if the sizing is right I'm sure it'd look amazing.<br />However I didn't want to have to put so much work into making it feel right on my body.<br />So it's a bit risky of a buy but if you're creative you won't regret it~especially given the good quality of the top."
3.0,"Dress is adorable, but cut way to small. I ordered a xxl, I'm a 1x and there's no way this fits too small in chest and arms."
3.0,Fits are a little larger then expected and calf part not as sturdy as I hoped. But over all good for price
3.0,Not what I expected. Other than being to long and being elastic meaning when you tighten it the belt material stretches.
3.0,Very cute but it bled quite a lot when I washed it in cold water.  The color is pretty and it's cute and swingy and short as pictured (I'm 5'5&#34; - definitely a mini).  Just wash it by itself the first time.  I washed it in cold water with some other colored clothes and the dye showed up on the other things.
3.0,I ordered an XL and was surprised that the arms were an excellent length.  I ordered the XL because I like my fun shirts to be loose...the body is very fitting and the black words can barely be seen.
3.0,"I expected it to be longer.  It fits fine width-wise, but length-wise it is lacking (of course, maybe I should have tried an XL - Tall, but didn't see that option).  Aside from that, it seems to be of decent quality."
3.0,"I didn't notice the dangle gem hanging between the cups. Bought for a boudoir photo shoot. Didn't end up wearing.<br />The cups even without the pads are not sheer.<br />It fits well, I will wear when going out and it looks good under sheer tops or button ups. Just not what I expected.<br />Oh, and I removed the beautiful dangle gem."
3.0,"I have small arms, so the sleeve tends to loosen fairly quickly and I have to tug on it all day.  Wish I had bought the ones that cross-over the shoulder."
3.0,"Runs way large according to the sizing provided.<br /><br />I was kind of surprised that they described a size 8-10 as XL, but I know swimsuits can be tight, so I got the XL.<br /><br />It is definitely too large, and gaps in the back. Unfortunately I was too excited to try it and hoped it would shrink in the wash, but no luck."
3.0,just did not fit my needs. I prefer a better fitting lighter weight set of glasses.
3.0,Smaller the ten average 2x
3.0,little to casual to wear with a nice dress
3.0,"I don't know how long they will last, but my daughter states they are comfortable."
3.0,Rubs on my ear after awhile can only where for a little bit.  Also sticks out kinda far from head.
3.0,"Does the job. I had tried to write an honest simple review and that wasn't good enough for this seller.  I asked to no longer be contacted and that wasn't enough. The seller insisted on contacted me and asked for a retraction.  Bad move. I removed the product from my glasses and threw them in the trash. This product is complete garbage.  Maybe next time you'll leave well enough,  alone. Zero stars. Buy anything but this product.  Happy now  seller...by the way,  they don't send you a second set for reviewing their product."
3.0,"These studs are ok and fit in my piercing just fine, The rings fit too but the color faded off the rings."
3.0,My wife didn't care for the material just not flattering though the dress would be awesome with higher quality materials
3.0,"Bought this for the specific purpose of transporting a $500 bottle of bourbon. Followed the instructions and am about to pack this in a suitcase, but I guarantee you that I will be surrounding this with plenty of clothes, placing in the middle of my suitcase and praying to the TSA gods that they do not mess with the bottle in transit. After fully inflating the bag, it is clear that this is meant to be one part of a strategy for transporting bottles and not an all-in-one solution. If you place pressure on any part of the bag, particularly the recessed portions in the middle, you can feel the bottle. I lightly tapped the side of the inflated bag with bottle against my table and heard a concerning, loud thud. Will report back after trip."
3.0,"Its comfortable, but it can dye your pillow a odd color"
3.0,"The earrings are very light, however they fall out continuously."
3.0,"I wear a medium but got a large since it is cotton. It is too small and the sleeves fit very tight. I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs. Buttons are a bright gold."
3.0,"The rings are sometimes not closed well which can scratch bare skin, or tear thin fabric"
3.0,"Bought for a costume, they were smaller than I thought it would be."
3.0,Don’t stay on .
3.0,Wish they would look like what is on model’s.ordered the extra large.
3.0,Minimal arch support. Largesr size 10 ever.
3.0,I'm a 38H and this did not fit and did not have any support. I wouldn't recommend it.
3.0,The sterling silver bar is sooo think that it does not like me
3.0,Faulty advertising.  Says Korean clothing - actually comes form China.  When ordering Chinese clothes - ALWAYS start out with a 4X if you expect it to fit a US large size.
3.0,I use the pants for work.
3.0,It was way bigger than what I thought it would be for a kids small
3.0,"100% cotton.... very much doubt it. I'll see when I try to dye it, but it feels synthetic to me."
3.0,"I ordered two of these shirts, one in deep purple and the other in steel blue.  I also ordered different colors in the scoop-neck t-shirt version.  These shirts were very soft and comfortable, however I preferred the fit of the t-shirt version.  I ordered these in medium and they seemed quite large for a medium.  Ultimately they didn't hang on my body in a way that I liked.<br /><br />Unfortunately besides not liking the fit of the shirts, they also had very obvious defects in the dye of the fabric.  The steel blue was incredibly obvious and absolutely unwearable.  Deep purple was a little less noticeable, but still unwearable.  Also, the shirts were quite see-through and both colors were not nearly as saturated as I was expecting.  The deep purple was still pretty, but the steel blue looked more like grey with a blue tone.  Even without the defects in the dye job, I still would have returned them due to the fit, but the colors really killed it for me.  I had issues with the dye in the t-shirt version of this shirt as well.  My advice? Think about sizing down and only order in black and navy to avoid color issues."
3.0,"The material was a little flimsier than expected, but overall it's good for the price."
3.0,I bought an x lg shirt and still it was to small so if you are a large built get the biggest size you can because they run small  very small
3.0,Dress is same halter top style but the pattern is not what is advertised at all in the image. It looks blocky and rather awful. I'm not sure if I can even wear it. Might even need to return it.
3.0,"Very nice look and weight, arms are a little flimsy however"
3.0,Not my favorite. Felt like they ran a little big and a little too much stretch. Not bad for the price though.
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress, and the lilac color is definitely beautiful. The only problem I have with the dress is, while the fit is perfect, the fabric is soft and stretchy, and the cut is very flattering for all body shapes especially large chests like mine, the seams are very, very unsightly. There are two seams running up the bust, basically accentuating your nipples, and a large seam running up the middle of the front and back of the dress, which seems to cut the dress and the way it lays in half so it lays rather oddly. The rest of the dress is perfect and cute, but the seams really do make me feel uncomfortable, so I've been wearing a jacket with it. I love how comfortable and pretty the dress is, and it's very lightweight, but the seams really do turn me off from wearing this regularly."
3.0,The overall quality of the piercings were great. However the angle of the bend makes it very easy for it to fall out. Very difficult to bend more
3.0,They give the appearance of being inexpensive in person
3.0,I purchased the dinosaur 2 pack and the pants are very cute but the material is thinner than I expected. I will be keeping them for when the weather warms up but disappointed that they are not fleece pants as stated in the product description.
3.0,"They for but they are very thin... so if u have any ripples, dipples, bumps, or humps they will show."
3.0,Biene un poco más grande la talla de calzado
3.0,It's fine for the price.
3.0,"A wonderful variety.  Box was tiny, so I was a bit worried. Turned out fine. However,  I wish there were some longer snake eye ones. Theres none for the tip of the tongue snake eye piercing (my biggest disappointment); yet a whole bunch of tiny ones I'll have to give away because I don't have certain piercings."
3.0,"They are good quality, but quite large on my wrist."
3.0,looks great.. a little of the stitching on inside was not finished
3.0,"So this shirt is sort of cute, but it's super cheaply made and I'm pretty sure that once I wash it, its going to pill and discolor past the point of no return. I'm going to keep it because I wore it and will wear it again.... If it lasts that long!"
3.0,"The dress fit fine but was very thin.  I bought it to wear in 40-50 degree weather, but this dress is WAY too thin for that.  Somewhere tropical with cool nights would be perfect, but I have enough of those.  It also had a design in the midsection that I didn't notice in the pictures, kind of a cross stitching that formed diagonal lines across the midsection- I didn't like that either; it kind of made me look like I had a belly.  My size is normally a small (5'5"" and 128) and I ordered a small.  The fit wasn't the problem.  It was the style and material- I wasn't a fan."
3.0,"My wrist is about 6 inches. Even after removal of all the possibly removable pieces, the watch still rolls around my wrist. It should be ok if the wearers have wrist measuring more than 6 inches."
3.0,I bought this product to use it as a mask during this Covid19 situation but I should mention it is too warm for this summer season and it is not worthful.
3.0,Exactly what I was wanting. The color is gorgeous.  They aren't heavy.
3.0,these showed up in a little brown envelope after a few weeks. Product is nice just bigger than expected. Will still wear just won't order the other colors as to big for me to want to wear often.
3.0,"This cape is cute, but it is poorly constructed and not long ALL, it is blazer length, but cape style."
3.0,"Bought these gloves for 11 dollars, which is super cheap but they are also on the cheap side. Not real leather, your hands still get cold if you use them while riding on a bike because of wind chill and worst of all they leave your hands smelling like fish. They're great for a costume but that's about it."
3.0,Loved them. They looked great on but made a little sound when walking.
3.0,They are really tight. I'm barely able to wear them at my knees let alone my thighs like they're supposed to be. And I don't have thick legs.
3.0,Nice print. Too big fir my head.
3.0,Nice leather for the price but be aware that the loop to hold the end of the belt can easily slide off.
3.0,MINI earrings. I need to start reading the sizes!<br />But pretty
3.0,The rhinestone snap- on bezel is great. The bracelet watch and is extremely difficult to fasten or unfasten.
3.0,Cute bracelet but it is not made very well. You need to be careful when wearing it
3.0,"Disappointed that the connection to the face of the watch wiggles and does not feel secure. Band loosens with increased activity. Otherwise , color is exact and complementary."
3.0,Sweatshirt is a little thin. And the color is not what is shown . More of a bubblegum pink
3.0,Squeezes your ear tightly
3.0,Seem to be the answer to my spontaneous need for readers however the glasses would continually fall from the case never to be found. This occurs on all 4 pairs I purchased
3.0,"The belt is wonderful until you try to take it off.  It releases easily when it isn't on the body.  When it is being worn, the release does not work at all.  I had to literally squeeze out of my trousers to work the release button."
3.0,"Very cute necklaces! They are very cheap, though, and tarnished after about a month. I ended up throwing it out, but it was very cute!"
3.0,"Overall it's cute, well made. The knit is a looser and somewhat see through so a tank might be required for some, but it doesn't bother me. My biggest complaint would be this sweater does not fit like the product photos - the oversized, long sweater. It's short, basically a crop sweater. I'm 5' 11, and the bottom of the hem hits at my navel. Not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,I didn't notice or realize that these are like safety glasses with clear plastic that makes them almost goggle style
3.0,I loved this purchase! And my fiance loved it as well I bought it as a gift for Father's day. It unfortunately fell apart while we were out somewhere and couldn't find it :(
3.0,It fits well and I was really excited about it but I'm down a pocket because it was sewn on upside down. ): Everything else is fine.
3.0,One day I will find a swimsuit top that the foam boob bits don't move around or flip up awkwardly. That swimsuit will not have been designed by a man. IN THE MEANTIME. This swimsuit is great. The top is secure so you don't have to worry about it coming undone if you go down a water slide or move around like what real people do at pools.
3.0,"I wanted to love these but I'm not a fan of the waistband. They say it's a wide waistband but there's a smaller, harder elastic band within the cloth waistband."
3.0,"Tight bag, has no flexibility. stiff. But I do receive a lot of compliments."
3.0,When I got this I falowed the revuse in sized up well when it came I put it on and it's still alittle to small it's not oversized at all.
3.0,"I have student that is deaf. So this is great for teaching lip readers. Also, I am able to share a smile. Only problem they are a little large"
3.0,I have the Samsung Galaxy Active and ordered the rose pink and Rose gold.  NEITHER matched the active.  The pink was too pink and also a matte finish.  The rose gold was just gold but it was glossy.  The rose gold band was very nice...i just wish it had matched my watch.  I had to return both.
3.0,"I've always bought Amanda style in this same size but they seem to have narrowed the legs on this one. I have not gotten bigger. All my other Amanda jeans fit. This is annoying. If they change the fit, they should change the name."
3.0,"Fits nicely. Thin, sheer fabric. Pretty colors."
3.0,"I am 5'06"", weighing at around 150 lbs, 34-35 Bust. I ordered a Medium (please see pictures). I already washed it once just to see if it would shrink a little, it must have because it fits a little better than before. I'm the type of person that likes formfitting clothing; sweatshirts have traditionally been my enemy on this front, but a year or 2 ago for Christmas I bought a different brand and I loved it. That brand is no loner on Amazon, so I tried this one.<br /><br />The inside material is soft, warm and cozy, so that's a plus. Make sure you wear a supportive bra with these though because you definitely look like a slouch without. Maybe I'm too judgmental on myself.<br /><br />I would have preferred it to be a little tighter right under the breasts. The neck hole is tight, I have to take my glasses off to get my normal sized head through. The pocket hole is a single layer of fabric that probably wouldn't keep your hands warm. Everything else seems okay. Hope this helped."
3.0,"Out of 40 pieces, 5 did not work and 5 were dim.  Grandkids loved them, so the low price was still is worth it."
3.0,"Too big. Do Not sit on ear the right way - they lean forward, maybe because they are too big and heavy."
3.0,Dress wasn't as I expected. I didn't know the sides and back were lace. I returned the item
3.0,I doesn't work. My sons was wearing another pant below this that got immediately wet. Should be more water proof to some degree.
3.0,I like the cap but I thought the inside would be satin. I wear it on top of my scarf.
3.0,This jersey is way too small for XL!!
3.0,"Beautiful bag!  However, the one I received looks like plastic all over the purse is coming loose from the faux crocodile embossing.  I've contacted the seller for a replacement.  Will let you know..."
3.0,"Glasses make things very clear and crisp, too bad they were too wide for an average adult face. I’ve tried on the same brand that a friend had and I didn’t have this issue. Maybe a quality control issue?"
3.0,"I ordered the L/XL size.  The package clearly states ""L"". The manufacturer's site says it makes XL but apparently it's not for sale.<br />The L sox fit great until they get below my knee. The cuff is so tight I cut it and it was still tight! For about $10 bucks it was worth the experiment to see if it would work.  If an XL was available I would buy it. Going back to Walker's brand."
3.0,Writing this review after having the band for over 7 months. I loved it at first but over time the bands rose gold color has faded and worn off in a bad way and now looks too cheap to wear. The magnetic clasp has also lost its grip and the band now loosens too easily like while sleeping.
3.0,"The ring looks amazing, and I get tons of compliments when I wear it, however it did arrive with a noticeable scratch on the jewel. I didn't return it because I knew it would get a scratch in it soon after I started wearing it (I work retail, play guitar, do diy projects, etc)"
3.0,"Not what I was expecting. I thought they were going to be made of soft cotton with a relaxed fit.<br />Instead:<br />1.  the fabric is really crisp. I can’t confirm they have cotton in then as the only tag they have is the size (no material, no country of origin, no instructions on how to wash and dry them).  Think about linen kind of feeling. I suspect they’ll come out pretty wrinkled from the washer, but I haven’t washed them yet as I can’t wear them. See below.<br />2. The fit *is* relaxed alright, but the waist is so narrow, and the elastic band is so tight that’s like having a python squeezing you. I love the “loose elastic” statement in the description. Sure. I measured the pants waist side to side from the outside and it’s ~12 in (~30cm). See picture. The traditional waist measurements for a size S are 26 to 27 in (66 to 68 cm) or even more depending on size charts. So these are at least 2” out of size, which is typically the difference between sizes. Based on my experience you should order a size up. Also I’m not sure they would flatter many body types. They have two strange seams along the side of where your lower belly is…. Seemingly accentuating it.<br />Overall, not pleased."
3.0,"The image of these batteries are incorrect. The actual batteries are labeled Hitachi Maxell, Ltd. Alkaline Battery LR44 A76 1.5v, but they work."
3.0,"5’4”, 130 lbs., 34D bust  Material not that great."
3.0,"It is comfortable, but runs small, buy it one size larger"
3.0,"Nothing special about it.  I like that it has a lining in the front so that it is not see through, but the sleeves with the elastic is a little tight if you pull them up.  It's long enough to tuck in.  It's ok"
3.0,"Pretty from afar...but not a very good quality top. Hems were uneven, loose threads everywhere, and just not a top I see lasting more than a couple wears. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"If you didn't know what it says, you would never know cause the writing is too small."
3.0,"Have 4 of these, in small and medium - not a significant difference. I took the darts out, didn’t want fitted flannel shirts. The weight is nice, not to thin and flimsy; and construction is nice too. I wash carefully-no fading, no shrinking- My only complaint is after 4 washes they have begun to pill and that makes any fabric look bad -I have old flannel that never pilled. I am over 70 so I have some OLD flannel shirts... that still look good. I would be upset if I had paid full price!"
3.0,Straps should be longer to make it easier to use during travel. Otherwise great bag!!
3.0,This hoodie was soo nice until she put it on! It instantly tore a whole wear the seam is! It’s kinda cheap stitching! Just be prepared to do a lot of stitching when holes appear
3.0,pocketbook was ok didn't last to long
3.0,"I really like the hat, but it was too small on my head. I didn’t return it,  I could still wear it, barely, it has a tie at the neck. I keep it in my car for emergencies. I live in Florida, sometimes the sun is over bearing. If you have a small head this is a perfect hat."
3.0,"I usually wear the leg warmers on top of my pants and up to my knees to keep them warm and because I the look but these do not stretch much, the fit is a bit tight in spite that my legs are on the skinny side.  Other than that they look nice, I love the color combination"
3.0,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNWJM9H/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br /><br />These socks are cute and soft, fit as expected (size 7 shoe) but please take a look at the pink pair with the...sheep? Goat? Bull? Minotaur? No idea what the animal is, but REALLY have no idea what the writing on the socks means. When I went back to review the order thinking this was a misprint, nope, I realized the socks match what is online - &#34;ADD A ITTIF TD EACH DAY&#34;. I just didn't notice! These were a gift and we decided to laugh about it, but really, what does this mean?"
3.0,These are super cute and sturdy but way too bog for my 12 yr old son. These are adult size.
3.0,"Decent fabric. Comfortable. Description here states ‘short sleeve’ - it has long sleeves - like in photo. As I wanted long sleeves, this worked for my needs."
3.0,"Great for small face, my 8 year old clipped them on his glasses and they were just a bit larger but worked great. But they quickly broke."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Runs a size smaller
3.0,"Nice pants.  Easy to wear.  My only complaint would be that they are about 1/2"" on the short side.  Not quite ""high water"" but would be perfect if a little longer."
3.0,"Perhaps a good value for the price, but the hat does not hold its shape well and even though shipped in a big enough box, arrived somewhat out of shape.  Perimeter of brim has an embedded wire (apparently) that lets you adjust to your preferred configuration, but the body of the hat tends to buckle and fold and will not hold a smooth shape."
3.0,"Got my first shirt and it was xxl and the arms were long enough but the shirt itself is short. It could really use another 3"" minimum in the body but I thought I could make it work. I ordered two more shirts and the second shirt, although also an XXL, was significantly smaller than the original. Sending it back. These shirts would really benefit from a long/tall option. Not bad quality otherwise."
3.0,Algo sencillos
3.0,it is ok does not state what the braclets stand for another mistake
3.0,"I thought the colored strap was longer, measurement is given including the ending thin straps. Not too happy."
3.0,Honestly very comfortable to wear around the house but that's me.
3.0,Cute but too small for my big fat face lol
3.0,I thought these would be the pink that is shown and ordered the second set they’re are gray with a tenge of pink. I am disappointed in the color but they are well made.
3.0,"i purchased this product twice (once in june 2020 and again july 2020) because i was so happy with the first pair, i bought a 2-pack the second time. i was certainly disappointed in the second shipment as the quality, feel, and fit was different from the first shipment. i can’t speak as to why, but buyer beware. in a matter of one month, the product changed. or, don’t buy the two pack because the quality is sub-par."
3.0,This is much larger than expected
3.0,"These are on basic sunglasses.<br />I like to have extra sunglasses for when I go places where I don’t want to bring my expensive ones.<br />They fit good, I have a square face and I feel they look good. But they are plain squares, I did not find them to be cat eyes at all.<br />They are lightweight and comfortables to use.<br />They are not big. I would say medium size.<br />They are ok to have like plan B sunglasses."
3.0,"As a watch it is great, gives me date, day of week, time in hours, minutes, seconds.  Has some other features like alarms and stopwatch that I don't use.  But as a step counter is doesn't work well.  I compared the counter to my older step counter and the watch is way too low.  When I actually walked and counted 200 steps, my regular counter said it was 203 steps, the watch only showed 96 steps.  That was regular walking.  When I am carrying something or pushing a shopping cart it's count is much much lower!"
3.0,These readers are ok. I just find I do not do well with u shaped  bifocals. My focus is never right. I prefer plain readers that I can lower or look over. you might want to see if these work for you
3.0,"This leggings have no stretch, thin material and too short."
3.0,Product was good but it was very late getting here
3.0,"I'm giving it three stars because no instructions came with this kit, or even a tool list description.  I'm unfamiliar with a number of the items and not sure what they would be used for.  I have replaced watch batteries prior to getting this kit and was looking for tools to hold the watch and to safely remove the watch back.  I was able to figure out which tool to use to hold the watch, but for me it was not intuitive."
3.0,These fit super weirdly. At 5’10” my torso was too long for them and they kind of gave me a wedgie... except that the leg holes are way too big. They are going back.
3.0,I didn't care for the glasses.  I need reading glasses at a strength so I can see the computer.  These glasses were not at a strength so I can't use them.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this sweater. It's made of 100% cotton, which is unusually hard to find these days. Everything is made out of polyester. The blue color is a really pretty blue, but it's just a little too short for me. It's boxy and unflattering, at least for my body. I'm 5'7, 185 pounds for reference, and I have a short torso! Cute sweater, but just not for me."
3.0,"These are not polarized, but for 5$ they are fine. I was upset that they will not be the back up fishing glasses I intended them to be, but now they will be the back up pool party glasses that I never knew I needed."
3.0,"The lens is extremely thin. I understand it's necessary to keep it light, but I am worried that it will break very easily."
3.0,"I’ve had to buy two orders of this (8 total extenders) because they fray after constant use. They did their job well and held up for a decent amount of time. In the end though, they would fray and I had to replace them."
3.0,like the dress but it is polyester
3.0,"I ordered this in dark gray and black. Both fit pretty snugly...the black one more so than the gray, oddly. They are very warm, but know they have zero stretch and they do run small. If they had this in an XXL, I'd get more, but since they don't, I need to return the XL in Black."
3.0,These are flat not three dimensional just FYI.
3.0,hard to hook on but it cute
3.0,"It's a really cute shirt and feels like a good quality shirt, but the sleeve holes are SO BIG and baggy.  I may return it... which is sad, cuz it is really cute."
3.0,My nephew loves a glasses
3.0,The glasses where shipped in a timely manner.when I received they where much smaller.My daughter could not fit them so I ended up giving them away
3.0,"Good quality!<br />Hard wood!<br />Exotic design!<br /><br />The two missing stars mean: please reconsider packaging options, such as the box so it’s most likely to prevent breaking."
3.0,pretty but not too functional.. The lace scratches my nose.
3.0,Don’t stay up. Not good if you sweat.
3.0,"As much as I LOVE the concept, the ends that go through the holes...the nubs irritated and rubbed on the top of my foot. I had no choice but to return them...I really wished they worked..."
3.0,I thought these mittens would keep my hands warm in extremely cold weather (0 to 20 degrees) but they don't.
3.0,The necklace is beautiful but the chain that is display in the pictures (that they also save one entire picture to display it by itself) is not the sameone that comes with the necklace. The one that comes with it looks very cheap and entangles all the time
3.0,"Pretty outside, but lining was coming off on the inside. It was also not quite as large as I had hoped. Returned it"
3.0,I would love this if it were not made so skimpily. I am usually an XL and that is what I ordered but wish I had gotten a 2XX. Size chart must be in Chinese sizes.
3.0,"Nice fabric and cut, but smaller than expected. You might order a size up to get something that fits better."
3.0,These look amazing and are even better when you break in the leather. The only bad part is the cheap quick release bars. I've had one of the straps come undone while I'm wearing it. The part of the leather that holds the bar seems to be very weak and looks like its going to rip.
3.0,"The pants fit perfectly for me. But, you get what you pay. The product is from China. Looks like a knock off Adidas model. Stitching around the waist is a mess with a lot of loose ends because they don't care about presentation. Material is feeling a little plastic-ky, but still comfortable to wear."
3.0,"It looks cool, that’s for sure.  Would be really nice if it had a silver core, but it is stainless so the weight is off a bit too much to get that luxury feel that really makes the bling worth wearing."
3.0,"The leopard is very nice but the zebra is too small for using lice a scrav. If you are expecting to wear more the zebra design I suggest to but a separated zebra shawl, but if you are expecting to wear the leopard more than the other this purchase is going to be good for you"
3.0,"The armholes have a weird fit and the shirt itself is very boxy. It's not flattering at all for anyone who has an hourglass or pear shaped body. Darts or pulling in the side seams in a curve would have benefited this shirt. It's not see through, but it's really not worth it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this shirt."
3.0,After reading reviews I ordered much larger than my normal size. They fit perfectly when I first put them on but when I walked they crept up to mid thigh. I wanted them specifically to be knee length to wear under dresses. The fabric is incredibly thin and see through (like a burn out tee) so I would not recommend wearing these as anything other than an undergarment. Because the material is so thin I don't dare try a smaller size.
3.0,Its actually pretty big. I cant really wear it cuz I dont like how it fits.
3.0,"These bras were very comfortable and fit fairly  well. The only thing I didn't like is , with me being a large breasted woman(42D) I was looking for something  that separated  so i didn't appear to have a uni-boob. Looking at the photos online  they appeared to help with that but unfortunately  they do not. They are comfortable and the jewel color is very pretty. Nice as a layer under a tank top but I will not be ordering  any more."
3.0,"I received this watch as a gift and I love it, its beautiful and works perfectly.  The only issue I've had is that the leaf that comes as a charm is attached by a metallic ring that is loosely closed and gets opened easily, so I've lost my leaf several times.  I fixed it with a drop of super glue, it's not a big deal, but it would be nice if those came securely attached."
3.0,The plastic is flimsy and the coin needs to be doubled to secure and stay in place.
3.0,"So yea.  It looks cool and you get two, but really, why put a D-Ring on a belt when any potential use will likely result in it breaking and you plummeting to your death.  Seriously, this is a stage prop, not a survival belt.  That being said, I did use it this season bow hunting.  I typically carry a sidearm and was looking for a stiff belt I could holster a sidearm on.  The velcro is ok, but the its a one side fits all but not really you had to make saccrifices type of thing.  Its good enough and worth the $$."
3.0,"They do come unraveled easily, especially when you’re washing. I wish the stitching on them was better, but other than that they are wonderful and they haven’t faded at all."
3.0,Looks better on her.... it's very thin
3.0,I really like this watch and think it is beautiful. The clasp is different from what I am use to and sometimes comes undone. Not sure if the battery is older but the phone continues to stop. Going to get it checked out.
3.0,I like the dress but I think I'll end up taking out the elastic around the waist. I'm sure it's cute on some people but I didn't like how it looked on my body with the elastic. It's comfortable for sure though! I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs and the small was a perfect fit. Came down just below my knee which is where I like it
3.0,"It was a little small compared to other XL products. Very comfy material. Keeps you warm. Washed a few times and hung to dry. No problems with picture cracking or fabric tearing. But again, didn’t even chance it by putting in the dryer.  Gave 3 stars bc it’s annoying when I go by product info and it’s still too small."
3.0,"I generally like the band but am not fond of the white plastic that attaches to the watch and the white edges along the edge of the band. The ""main"" picture in the product description does not show this. Yes, when you look at all the pictures it is visible in others. But those pictures are at a distance and I had not noticed. That white plastic would have been enough for me to not buy. That said, it fits a Garmin Vivoactive 4 perfectly and is quite comfortable."
3.0,"Nice hat, kind of hurts my head"
3.0,"This was much larger than I had anticipated.  It was nice, but really couldn't be worn out."
3.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful suit and is very well made. Giving three stars because I sized up and it was still too small - as someone who wears an 8 or 10, I shouldn't have to size up 2-3 sizes for it to fit. I could barely get the 12 past my hips, and pulling it all the way up gave me quite the workout. However I liked the look of it so much that I sent the 12 back and ordered the 14. It's still somewhat of a chore to get on but once it's on it looks simply amazing."
3.0,"These rings are ok. I bought one for me & one for my mother. Within a month, my ring broke & my mother's began to turn. It is not real silver!!! The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it was cute & we received compliments on the rings."
3.0,Ok but gets out of shape easily
3.0,Pretty. Pretty small - I kept it anyway.
3.0,It's sorta a goat..... the horns are sewn in backwards and they won't stay standing up like in the picture. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Cute small light weight
3.0,I loved this ring but unfortunately the gold wears off so it only lasted about 6 mo for me.
3.0,length just a tad short
3.0,"Pretty dress, but it accentuated my little post baby belly and made me look pregnant"
3.0,Love the shirt and comfortable.
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected (not so easy to access the cards) but I use it, you get use to it."
3.0,The dress itself is very cute and nicely made but runs VERY VERY small.  My granddaughter is 8 years old and loves to wear cute sundresses.  I bought her this dress in a couple of different patterns in girls size M(10/12) which according to the size chart would fit a girl either 8-9 years old or 10-11 years old.  As a matter of fact the tag inside the dresses I received stated 8/9 year old.  The dress was so small I would guess it was more suitable for a 6 year old.  I returned both of the dresses.  I was bummed out.  Order larger size than needed.
3.0,"These are clearly inexpensive waders, and I'll be using them as a backup for the ones I favor.  Some notes - they're made of the same or similar materials as most common breathable waders.  Inside looks normal for breathables.  The exterior is a little bit shinier nylon than I've seen in other waders, but they seem of average durability.  The seams are sewn on the outside and taped on the inside.  Most basic features are included.  Booties are standard neoprene with soles a bit thicker than sides and taped seams.  Integrated gravel guards are standard as well.  Wading belt is standard and of typically low quality, as are the plastic buckles.  Shoulder straps are elastic and standard.  There is NO chest cinch on this model.  There is one chest pocket with a waterproof/water-resistant zipper.  The zipper is bright orange, which may scare fish!  I do like the darker color of the material for camouflage.<br /><br />The waders are lacking reinforcement at typical stress points like knees, seat and crotch.  Seam joints also lack reinforcement on the interior.<br /><br />Fit is a bit odd.  I'm 5'10"", 200 lbs and got a Large based on other comments.  The waders fit well in the chest. waist and crotch.  The legs are a bit long and therefore are quite baggy at the knees.  The booties are HUGE!  My feet are generally 8.5-9, US or 42 European.  These booties would easily fit size 11-12 shoes, and my feet are swimming in them.  That will create the potential for uncomfortable and perhaps leaky compressed folds inside my wading boots.  More on that after I actually use these onstream.<br /><br />All in all, these are probably worth around $50-75 US.  I wouldn't spend much more than that.  Great backup or travel version, especially if you're packing into your fishing location, or good for beginners and kids as an inexpensive starter set.  You'll need to purchase wading boots as well - these are stocking-foot waders."
3.0,This dress was not flattering on me at all.  I am sending it back.  Not fitted enough through the waist.
3.0,Love them! They fit perfectly. Made it thru 1st wash/dry intact. Very comfy & cute jeans!
3.0,"These socks do a reasonable (not great) job of protecting my feet in cold weather. However, they do not do well in a standard washer and dryer.  They start to unravel quickly.  I may not be able to get more than a few uses from them."
3.0,I kept these boots because they do look great on my legs but the toes are the most pointy toes I have ever seen.  If you are going to order these boots get them 1/2 size bigger.
3.0,"I am 5'3, 125 lbs. I really wanted to like this but didn't fit my midsection, gave me muffin tops. Looks better on someone with a smaller waistline."
3.0,"How the F!%$ do you work the clasp on this watch band? Normal bands typically consist of a pin and a hole. The watch itself is great,nearly 5 stars, but the leather band is like the band Milli Vanilli with Helen Keller as their lead singer singing &quot;killing me softly.&quot; Seriously, if in the future your going to sell a watch with a deployment clasp then you might want to mention that in your ad or risk satirical sutures. Or at the very least, list the litany of adverse side effects induced from the near equivalent of installing a combination lock into a mere strip of leather."
3.0,"see through.. Other than that, its a jersey like material. no frills or thrills to write home about."
3.0,Sizing is a little off but still cute
3.0,"I would suggest that you order dress one dress size down, made oh, and I ordered in my size. Not considering this a loss oh, I was able to use it as a beach cover-up! Love the color combination!"
3.0,It looked better in the picture than on so I returned it.
3.0,Disappointed thought I was getting both sets.
3.0,"Loved this cute little anklet when I got it, lightweight and stylish. Unfortunately I went to the beach last week and the anklet didn’t hold up well against the ocean. One chain fell off and the others actually rusted from the saltwater. I wish it would’ve been better sealed so I could’ve worn it longer!"
3.0,Smaller than I anticipated.  Won't know how it works for me until my next trip.  Do like the fact that it is so light weight and is a nice fabric.
3.0,"It is tighter than I expected and the straps are set very wide, which I find uncomfortable. I had very high hopes for them, but they just aren't the cut for me. But they are nice looking and well made."
3.0,"Thought this was cute and since I'm on the small side I thought it would fit well. The top is made kind of weird and from what I can recall isn't that adjustable. Or maybe it was the actual bikini top. Either way, I had to try to find a different top. The shorts are cute. That's all I can really say."
3.0,"Kind of cheap material, but with a top and jacket or sweater over it it does the job for work."
3.0,"Pockets are much higher than pictured. Instead of near my wiast or hip, they're right under my breasts.  Sleeves are tightish, shoulders are narrow. I sized up for this purchase and it's not as oversized as shown.  Will still work as a beach cover-up."
3.0,Meant more for females but can be used for additional warmth in crappy NY winters. Say on top of a beanie or skullcap. Wouldnt wear this alone again as a male.
3.0,"Great hat but one of the snaps came undone so it kind of droops on one side. Photo 1 shows disconnected side, photo 2 shows snap has come off and photo 3 shows what the snap  is suppose to look like."
3.0,"As warm as your favorite fuzzy blanket. I live in south GA but was visiting my family in central NY when my sister did the family Christmas PJ thing. She purchased another brand for me (Just Love) or something along those lines). That brand's XXL was more like Ekouaer's XL maybe. Anyway, no can do. I have purchased many pairs of Ekouaer's PJs, various styles and went with these. They fit ok. Could have used a little more stretch but they fit ok and washed & dryed beautifully."
3.0,Week seems to be a rush project
3.0,This would be a really cute suit for someone with a small bust. After reading the reviews I ordered a size larger than normal and it was enormous.
3.0,"It's soft and the knit is nice, but it doesn't look like the pic. Returned."
3.0,I purchased this in August immediately put it on my watch. Last night (December 25th) I took it off my watch to put on my new watch I received. One of the tabs broke off. It will not go back on the watch with the tab broken off.
3.0,Shipping takes forever and the material does not look like the picture.
3.0,I really like the glasses but the price is over the top. I use the glasses for golf and wear contacts. The glasses help to keep my eyes from getting dry. Why not give us a break on replacement parts???
3.0,The top fits perfect the bottoms are too small they are more like a extra small.
3.0,Comes as expected. Falls apart within a month. Not durable to be thrown around in a purse or backpack
3.0,"Funny to wear at maybe 4th of July or another patriotic event, but as sunglasses they are pretty terrible. Not surprisingly, they are very hard to see out of. Wouldn't recommend wearing them while driving."
3.0,"I returned the product they were too long for me. But, they were nice."
3.0,"It's very pretty, but it is not a dress. It's two separate pieces. The way it was photographed in the product photo, you couldn't even see what was on the bottom of the shirt. I wasn't expecting Christmas elves. the shirt is stretchy and feels pretty thick, and the skirt is beautiful, but not what I was expecting. So, slightly disappointed and will end up returning."
3.0,Cute wish it was a little longer but cute
3.0,one size fits all fits me usually. This one is a little tight. Also very heavy hat... I haven't wear this out yet cuz of the heavy weight and tight.
3.0,"Keep your forehead warm, easy to slip on"
3.0,"My wife and I regularly attend masquerade parties or costume parties within our circle of friends and through her job. The biggest complaint about wearing the correct style of mask, is that they are rather stiff and can be a little uncomfortable if worn for a long period of time. They also can make it difficult to eat or drink while wearing them. I purchased this mask to help to alleviate both of those problems. It did, but had a couple of drawbacks.<br /><br />The mask is fairly well made. I wouldn't want to use it to hold up something of any substantial weight, but it's a mask, not a net. For what you will need it to do, it should hold up well. My only concern is to how well it would hold up to being washed, which is a bit of a concern, because it is white. When my wife wore it for the first time, she naturally wore makeup with the mask. The makeup ended up getting on the mask, which required it to be washed after the evening. I hand washed it, which did work to get the mask clean, but that may have had as much to do with the detergent and bleach I used, and less with my technique washing it. Don't know how durable it will prove to be with repeated washing.<br /><br />It fits my wife's face well, but a little awkwardly. By that, I mean that the way it sits around her nose and cheek bones causes it to flare out slightly, away from her face. Obviously, that wouldn't affect everyone the same way, because everyone has a different facial structure. However, for my purposes (or, more accurately, my wife's), it is a little odd. I wouldn't necessarily recommend against buying it for that reason, but I would simply say to be aware of it.<br /><br />All in all, if you attend masquerade parties at all, and you would like a more comfortable and casual option for your mask, this mask is at least worth considering. You'll most likely be mostly pleased with the purchase, especially for the price."
3.0,"The fabric is nice, it feels wonderful on and the Christmas plaid is vibrant and lovely, but there are concerns regarding the fit and construction. The sleeves on the large are 20"" long and I worry they will shrink when washed. I will have to roll the sleeves if I decide to keep it as they are at least an inch too short for me. The pockets are too high on the sides of the shirt to be comfortable and the pocket openings are not the same size, one is 3 inches and the other is 4.5 inches. Even the 4.5 "" opening is too small. The actual pockets are just fine if only the seams of the sides were consistent and allowed the entire pocket to be open for use. The length is great for me to wear as a tunic with tights but I worry that the bust will be too tight once the item is washed as it fits very nicely prior to washing. I bought a large,  I am 5'8"" and 170# with a 37"" bust and wear a size M/L top, depending on the style. I am debating ordering the XL to see if the fit is better or try another brand of this same style shirt."
3.0,I love the quality but the sleeves were too short. If the sleeves were a little longer I would probably buy another one! Bummer!
3.0,Es muy bonita pero es muy grande me llega hasta la garganta tú be q doblarla por la parte de abajo para q me quedara bien
3.0,Beautiful in th ears. Easy to put on. Delicate so handle carefully.
3.0,I must have miscalculated the size required. Will use them for something else.
3.0,Nice boots.  Too small and I ordered a size larger.
3.0,Ordered this but the ends don’t fit correctly. One end keeps slipping off. I don’t understand why it doesn’t fit correctly
3.0,"My girlfriend says this shirt fit her ok everywhere except the armpit area. There was extra fabric under the arms which was wierd. She felt sizing down might make the arms fit better, but then would be tighter in the stomach area. She is 5'2, 160-165 lbs for reference."
3.0,Run a bit small & only 1 side pocket
3.0,LIKE STYLE BUT IT WAS WAY TOO SMALL.  I ORDERED A SIZE XXL ACCORDING TO SIZE CHART AND IT WAS STILL TOO SMALL.  I ORDERED SIMILAR STYLE AT ANOTHER STORE IN A SIZE LARGE AND THEY FIT PERFECTLY.
3.0,"I was really excited about this pack but it left me a bit disappointed in the end. Some pros: 1) the should strap compartments are easy to use. 2) the stretch pockets are awesome! I find I put most of what I need in them. 3) faily lightweight.<br />Cons: the pack itself sits too far rearward and creates 2 points of contact: shoulder and lower back. If you have a medium to short torso this is a HUGE problem as the pack is too long and will rub your lower back. That really sucks when  you sre hoping to run and hike with this thing for 10-20 miles. As such it is a major flop and I am not able to run with it. On the flip side, it works well as a commute bag if you bike to work. I ride my my bike to work often and as you lean forward on the handles it opens the space over the lower back and makes it usable. 2) computer pouch is really small. Dont expect to put much more than a 10-12 min THIN laptop.<br />Take home, UD marketed this as a sweet bag for adventure running. However, unless you have a long torso, you will be left very sad at your purchase. Better to pick up the Salomon S15 or  Nathan bag."
3.0,"I bought this watch band for my fitbit versa lite in the middle of January of this year.<br /><br />This band is very cute, it's durable, not a bad price and it does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />The only problem I found after only a month of wearing it, is that the design had already started to come off.<br /><br />I really do love the design, but I don't want to have to keep replacing bands every month or 2 because the design comes off that quickly. Luckily the biggest area where the design has been coming off is on the bottom.<br /><br />This product really works for what it's supposed to though, it's not a bad price and the design is cute."
3.0,Lenses were too dark for my eyes
3.0,Looked great when I got it but looked worn pretty quickly
3.0,"This PJ is okay. It fits true to size, at least the shirt. The material is lightweight and cool to touch but there is not even a tag to see what kind it is. It's well stitched but the pants waist is too tight for my comfort. It's squeezing me to the point of discomfort. I do not know how others like their PJs and lounge pants, but I like them loose and comfortable and these pants are not comfortable. I am a bit disappointed that I didn't like them more."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but it’s much smaller than expected"
3.0,"The shoes were purchase meant for daily walking the dog. The design looks well, but somehow the material seems very thin. It is light for sure, but at the same time felt frail. I can not wear it when doing quick walk with my dog. But for easy lazy walk, not a bad choice"
3.0,When you first put them on they fit very loose on your head and I don’t like that I really like a relaxed type of snug to my head but these were very loose and once you put the mask over the buttons it holds the head band in place but it’s still kind of loose so for me it kept moving so I really didn’t like them
3.0,"I got introduced to this brand at Minneapolis airport. When I saw “born to be wild” pants I just could not contain myself and got them right on spot. I was amazed by how durable those were and i instantly fell in love with this brand. These pants lasted me two years and I was wearing them everyday at home. Later on my husband got me “Nampo stay in bed” pants and the stress off the other pants was released 😂 but over time they just wore out and I had to look for replacement. I got the exact same pants and I was shocked to see how poor was the quality. On the very next day pants were covered with lint balls in comparison to my first pair it took almost a year! I am grateful that customer service responded to my complaint and gave me a replacement for free, and hence the reason for three stars instead of two, but the quality of material has only worsen up within the last 3 years..."
3.0,"First - love the dress.  Well-constructed, nice fabric, classy lines.<br /><br />That being said, ordered medium based on seller's size chart -  WAY too small.  5'2&#34;, 34dd 28.5w 37h, and could barely zip up the back. Not a skinny mum, but not overly fluffy either (130lb).  Per size chart, medium should have fit.  Zipped up, every roll & bulge above/below bra was obvious because of how tight dress is, NOT because of fabric weight.<br /><br />Laying flat, the measurements across the back of the dress I received were:  16 3/8&#34; armhole to armhole (less than 34&#34; bust) , 14&#34; at waist from sideseam to sideseam (28&#34; waist), 15 1/2&#34; length from shoulder to waist seam, and 39&#34; long total.  Maybe the dress was mislabeled M when it was a small?<br /><br />I will return this and try again with the large if available, and update the review."
3.0,"It's a decent shirt. Made well. The cross at the neck is high and the fit is a little wider than I expected. The fabric is very thick it doesn't hang as smoothly as in the picture and makes it feel wide. It's like a thick jersey cotton. In a different fabric it would lay nicer. Still a nice shirt, but would buy again."
3.0,"Loved the style, but this watch is made from the thinnest aluminum or something, it is nearly weightless! the six in Roman numerals was backwards... lol, making it 4 instead.....and the pin at the face keeps sliding out....good looking for a short wear, but too flimsy for everyday."
3.0,"I'm 6'3&#34; with an athletic build, and I found the sleeves to be to short. If you normally buy from a big and tall store, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
3.0,Nice overall. The inside strips are not as clear and look almost the same color as the frame.
3.0,"The quality is on par with the price point but the sizing is very small.  I am 5'7, 120 lbs, I ordered a medium and it is very tight. I think a large would have fit properly but clearly, the sizing range is very limited."
3.0,Cute band. The tie down slips a lot
3.0,Do the job but tight on your feet and rip easily
3.0,"I'm giving 3 stars because the quality looks good BUT the sizing is WAY off!  I'm a 36"" waist with pretty much EVERYTHING I wear but ordered both the L (36-38 Waist) and the XL (40-42 Waist) because I know sizes may vary.  Both L and XL were too small.  The L and the XL fit basically the same.  I returned them both and went to a local sporting goods store and bought their size large."
3.0,The decal is low quality & the product looks discounted. I bought this for a graduation present & ended up adding cash to the gift because it looked so cheap. Would not recommend.
3.0,"Got this 5 days after going to Kohl's and looking at it. The difference, Kohl's sale price was $100.00, got it here for less than $40.00 and it's exactly the same. Fits perfect and looks even better.<br /><br />Well after wearing this, it has started losing the blue. Still nice, but the blue started wearing off pretty quick in a couple of places. Have to drop it down to 3 stars because of that."
3.0,just too long with no way to hem without losing lace design
3.0,"Expensive suit fits well and is flattering but the color/pattern was very busy. For the price, I wanted it to be perfect."
3.0,"Even with the zipper unzipped, it still made the top uncomfortsble.  I like the look of it and it's warm, just not comfortable."
3.0,Really didn't like these pants. Just not comfortable and on the heavy side.
3.0,A nice bag but to heavy for what I needed
3.0,Returned runs to small but very cute
3.0,"Feels weird to say this, but I had a set of the mini-argyle socks from a couple years ago and they were my favorite socks. Comfy, no loose threads, stitching wasn't annoying, and a perfect blend of casual and dress. These new ones sadly aren't the same. They're thinner (bordering on sheer in some of the colors), the stitching seems more pronounced, and aren't as stretchy as the originals.<br /><br />If you can find a set where the black socks have gray diamonds instead of orange, and the navy has tan diamonds, I fully recommend those. I'll keep the new ones, but I don't like them as much"
3.0,"The top strand was too tight on my neck.  Sent it to my niece, and she loves it.  I thought it was very pretty....and got compliments when I wore it one time. Just too tight on me."
3.0,I'm too short for this ☹️
3.0,Got them for my large 3mo baby. Foot was good size but the top part/band was not as stretchy for his chubby ankles
3.0,To be worn as pictured it would have to be much larger. Wears slightly longer than a regular beanie. Looks awkward
3.0,Thinner than I would have liked but they will suffice. They definitely don't slip.
3.0,Suit fit smaller than normal; needed to order a size larger than bormal.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter in a medium. She typically wears a medium. The skirt was too small and a bit too high waisted for her taste. Unfortunately, we had to return it."
3.0,Some of the pom poms are unraveling and I just opened the bottle.
3.0,These are cheap looking and cheap feeling but they fit.
3.0,The top was too loose and the bottoms where nice just need to be a little tighter. Still a cute and great fit! I think ya need to add a XS.
3.0,The pendant was awesome.  Good quality!  However the cord it came with was to short for my husband.  So I had to buy another chain.
3.0,My only complaint is color.  Looked like emerald green .  Really a light olive in bright lights & gray in regular light.  Well made & comfortable. Would have preferred a more defined green color.
3.0,It's a nice purse overall and looks cute. However it does have a tendency to flip and all of my belongings end up falling out of it.
3.0,I didn’t like the material. I returned it.
3.0,little heavy but cute
3.0,Pensaba que era como se veian
3.0,"Bought for my 4 month old. Way to big, looks more like a 9-12 month size."
3.0,"The top fits fantastically. The bottom, unless you have no thighs or hips, like the model in the picture, fits tightly, but it's still ok to wear (actually I liked the way the tightness accentuated my assets, if you know what I mean...) The gripe that I have with this piece is that I am 5'9&#34; and there is no way I am ever wearing this as a dress. It is about one inch away from being naked. I wore shorts underneath and no one knew it was a dress, just thought it was a tunic. It did look really cute over shorts and in the fall I'm sure I'll wear it over some leggings because I do love the colors and the design of the sleeves."
3.0,"The fabric is rough it reminds me of a  thick stiff  T-shirt material, not a stretchy knit. But it is not see through and has some structure to it because of that.  It also sits a little boxy because the material does not hang or drape a ton... So that could be a positive if that is the look you are going for.  The length is great and the fit is mostly as expected from a size standpoint but the shape and way it hangs make the fit a little boxier.  The waistband is not adjustable so the knot on it is not functional. Im 5'3. and a size one, it was not clingy or form fitting all but wasnt too big looking."
3.0,"I just got the bag today, and the entire front panel with the roses appears to be faded. I guess I’ll see how it goes."
3.0,These are made to not fall apart and are adjustable to fit lots of faces. Only negative is that they are not cloth lined so the plastic sticks to your face. I found 2ways to remedy this. Easiest is to just turn it inside out: not pretty but functional. I chose to see 2 together so that the soft fabric touches my face and then they are reversible. My students like that they can see my face.
3.0,"Very &#34;Polyestery&#34;, looks and feels cheap."
3.0,"Took measurements before ordering. 102 cm bust (38C) purchased extra large. Can wear it for a night out, but it runs small and doesn’t fit at all as advertised. Material is light stretchy so there is some wiggle room if you want to wear this more fitted. Be careful with the button holes as most of them did have some not go great threading that would snag on the button. Will probably just return and get the largest size."
3.0,"The design on the watch strap is how it is pictured on the product photos. The strap, however, is cheaply made and uncomfortable to wear. If I can find a replacement strap somewhere I'll definitely be switching it out."
3.0,I ordered an xl. The upper arm was extremely tight as was across the chest. The extra large will fit an A or B bra size.
3.0,Took way to long to come in and it runs small
3.0,Bien bonita y práctica
3.0,"Got for my brother. It fit, but he said the waistband pinched him and the material was scratchy."
3.0,Could not adjust by myself so I broke it trying to adjust ball and chain
3.0,These dit like capris and not leggings. Too loose over the legs.
3.0,"Not as pictured, both horses face the same way so when wearing one horse is facing forward and one backward. They have a funny locket type hinged area with a pearl on the inside of the horse.  Hinge is not openable due to the wiring that makes the earring loop. Would not have bought them had I seen in a store."
3.0,Material was different than I expected it to be but it worked for the gift I gave.
3.0,Cute but a little see-through!
3.0,"3 stars because I measured myself and got the correct size and it still didn't fit. Might have been because I have more of a muscle build then a lean build body, and have pretty wide shoulders. Arm length shortened because of that, and it was tight.<br /><br />Feels like fleece, which is alright, it breathes very well (very thin fabric).<br /><br />The zipper feels cheap, the buttons feel cheap. Other then that, its a decent hoody for the price.<br /><br />I got the white one, and its SUPER white, made me think it'd be a great cosplay hoody.<br /><br />If you're a not lean/skinny build, I would recommend getting a size or two bigger from the chart after you measure yourself."
3.0,"No era lo q esperaba, me quedó gigante y la tela se ve muy ordinaria. Que pesar. Pasara a caridad en estos dias."
3.0,Loved the colors & print but it is as very small for a men’s extra large. I reordered an XXL & Gave that sweatshirt to my child.
3.0,Love the heart but not the chain
3.0,"Product fit nicely,  but not like picture shows. A little misleading.<br />Only complaint is I ordered April 2nd so I would have by vacation May 15th... dress kept getting pushed out arrived May 15th after we already had left for the week..... very disappointing since I did want it for my vacation...."
3.0,My husband doesn't like them
3.0,Not very comfy even if it was loose...I don't recommend this nightgown.  Should have sent it back.
3.0,It’s small. Not a men’s cap. For women ideal. You can fold it very flat. Fits in your pocket.
3.0,Love the shirt but it’s a little tight in the shoulders. I got a 2X and I normally wear a 1X still tight
3.0,"Cute dress, but it runs small. Order up one size."
3.0,Very nice wallet absolutely perfect in all aspects with the minor exception I would have given it 5 stars but the Swiss metal button attached to the wall it actually hurts your back side while sitting.
3.0,"I needed something sheer to wear with a charcoal colored dress. I am keeping this item because I have daughters who may wish to borrow it. I found it to be very stiff and very sheer..not really worth the money, but my one daughter likes it..so it's a keeper. I wouldn't order this in any color for my own personal use..just too stiff."
3.0,Glasses were made for a tiny face frame. More of a toddler glasses than for an adult.
3.0,"That is really all there is to it.  If you know that such an item is semi-disposeable, then you will appreciate the object itself.  Knotted tassels to keep it from unravelling at the edges, simple square of woven cloth."
3.0,I returned it  Was very cheap looking looked like plastic other than that was a nice size and style just didn't look worth the price to me
3.0,"Was looking for something that helped to wick away moisture during night sweats, this isn't it, but it still sleeps ok."
3.0,Though cute more like a tunic top to be worn with leggings.
3.0,Cute blouse but.it runs small
3.0,"While the shoes are absolutely gorgeous! I’m normally a size 8 with a medium foot size, I ordered an 8, and they fit more like an 8.5/9 as shown in the photos. The strap at the toes, also is very tight and uncomfortable. They cut into your foot. I ordered two pairs, I ordered a size smaller as well, size 7. The fit was better but the strap still cut into my little toes. I purchased them for a wedding that I’m in this summer. I won’t be able to wear them for more then a couple of hours as my feet will be blistered."
3.0,These were not as good as some I had purchased locally.
3.0,I normally wear a medium side shirt so that is what I order. I am 5'3&#34; and around 135lbs. It is tight on the top and only goes down to my ankles. I am planning on adding fabric to the bottom to make it longer because I prefer my maxi to hit the top of my feet. The fabric is extremely rough and there is no give in it. I  would have ordered a large if I knew but I will adjust to what I have.
3.0,Not the type of material I was looking for
3.0,"I don't have much in the trunk, and these leggings slide off easily. My husband likes the way they look on me tho! :)"
3.0,Rose will peel off if washed
3.0,"No earrings or gloves, sad when they want to dress up completely. Decent price but bummed there are pieces missing."
3.0,"Fits as expected, however not very great quality. I still wear them often, good summer slip on shoe!"
3.0,"It's OK but kind of cheap-looking.  It wasn't expensive so I didn't expect it to look expensive, but the quality is lower than I expected.  I could wear it to work but not for a dressy occasion."
3.0,"I purchased this skirt after having read all the reviews, and yes, the fabric is incredibly thin. It’s what you’d call featherweight; you can blow on it and it moves significantly. As such, it is more fragile than perhaps you’d want it to be, and mine did arrive damaged. I can fix it; for the price I paid, I wasn’t expecting a couture piece, just a pretty one. If you’re looking for a quick splash of color over a solid full length skirt, this will probably be a good and inexpensive answer. If you’re wanting it to last longer than getting it out of the package and wearing it once? Go make your own from Casa fabric at JoAnn Fabrics."
3.0,Dress fits well however I ordered the beige and the color looks nothing like the advertised picture. This sounds horrible but you look like a walking condom.
3.0,"Fit perfect, needs better insoles after standing/walking for 2 hours feet start to hurt"
3.0,No way is this 100% cotton. Every time I buy something from China that says cotton it’s polyester crap. Just be honest and stop lying. Thanks.
3.0,"Style was okay, but it's small. Had to return."
3.0,"These sandals are truly beautiful, which is why the three stars... but, they are sooo uncomfortable, I had to send them back. After reading other reviews, I got a half size larger. They fit, but were snug and very stiff -- just walking around my bedroom in them killed my feet! I kept trying to convince myself they weren't that bad because they are just so pretty, but I sadly returned them."
3.0,"It is the same as the picture, but to me it appears to be off center a little.  I was going to give it as a gift, along with the Matthew 17:20 necklace, but changed my mind and will keep it and get a different mustard seed necklace."
3.0,Was looking for a better quality hat. And it was too small there wa no way to gauge the size
3.0,"Its more of a cover up dress, really see threw<br />Towel like material"
3.0,"Its beautiful, but chain is way to small, good for a child."
3.0,"Overall,  i like the dress, its loose and comfortable,  the only problem was the dots didn't match up in front and my husband noticed it right off the bat, he thought ut was backwards because the dots in the back match up perfectly,  other than that,  its a nice dress comfy and loose high/low"
3.0,"didnt like the fit or style, not flattering"
3.0,"I'm in my 50s and when I put this on I felt like my 90 year old mom! Why couldn't it make me look like the 20 year old model?? (I guess that's the age old question! ha ha!) It's kind of shapeless and I'm short and it's long. I'll have to find a pair of creased polyester slacks to wear with it. Oh, and some white SAS shoes... (though my mom wore jeans and white Nikes... but I think you get the idea what I'm saying!)"
3.0,I have several pieces of Murano glass and this is the first one I have gotten that is one image on the front and another on the back. there are all black on the back of them.
3.0,It’s way too short.
3.0,Good quality which i would have given it a 5 star for.<br />I am giving it a 4 star because I had to return it. I ordered what I believed to be a 6x. What I got were two mediums and a large. Had they all been the same size in the order I would have given them 4 stars. Had I received the size I ordered I would have given them a 5 star. I returned the shirts and did not repurchase because I did not want to deal with the hassle of the sizes again.
3.0,I don't remember getting or ordering this.
3.0,its a beautiful blouse but man are the sizes completely off..
3.0,I am not a fan of the new shirts with the pockets.  The pockets sit weirdly towards the back and pucker out after washing. They are also shorter .  I am a huge fan of the original ones with no pockets and hope they are still available. Maybe in some new pastel colors and in size small. Please do not discontinue the pocketless ones.
3.0,Beautiful! I feel like it tarnished quickly tho... still i do not regret it still looks great
3.0,"Bought XL and XXL b/c I read majority of the reviews saying that it comes small BUT I should have just gone with my normal size.<br />The XL fits but once in the water, it starts to sag and lag.<br />If you're just hanging out in the pool it should be fine, but I'm a bit active in the pool and do laps.<br />So it's terrible for lapping unless you buy it tight.<br />I think it would have fit just fine if I went by their size guidelines.<br /><br />I wish the stripe print was on the back as well.<br />This swim suit has a baby/child like look. I think b/c it covers most of your body. From the back, it looks like a baby's onsie.<br />The chest pads tend to droop a bit too low but if I take those out, the suit will be just too big on me so I keep them on.<br /><br />I already experienced a problem in my previous swim suit purchase and so that was time consuming and more headache.<br />So I just decided to keep the XL, b/c I needed it asap.<br /><br />I'm 5'7&#34;, 36C, 30&#34; waist."
3.0,"Not a super fancy jacket but not bad for the price. I went off the size chart and ordered a large, I'm a 34DD (5'6 and a lean 150lb) and didn't want to have my chest popping put. But it is way too big, I could easily wear two sweatshirts underneath it. Returning no problem, will probably order a smaller size."
3.0,"I went back and forth over several dresses and finally settled on this one. It was an ok dress, but I ended up sending it back. It fit ok, but to me it looked really cheap. It was just made out of a thin cotton. It almost looked like a homemade dress made out of a pattern you would buy at a craft store. It might work for others, but it wasn't my style. It was certainly not what it looked like in the picture."
3.0,The sweater is beautiful and soft but the sleeves are very short. I got a small because it says oversized and I normally wear a small. I thought it would be roomy. The sleeves barely come to my hands. Disappointed in that.
3.0,"Cute dress, I really wanted to like it but the skirt fits so loose it looks frumpy."
3.0,"It's hard to tell if this works to block RFID or not, but it's rather small.  Not big enough to cover both sides of a credit card when you fold it in half.  Maybe it's covering enough of the card to block the important information, but why not add an inch to cover the whole card?"
3.0,Where the keychain is welded on is very thin so breaks easily.
3.0,"I got a US Large (I'm usually a medium) and it fits as long as you're not trying to bend over and pick up a lot of things. The material isn't that of a pajama pants, but more like a comfortable costume (If that makes sense?). Not to say I don't enjoy wearing it, but the material being so thick threw me off. And yes, it is very high in the crotch area."
3.0,This is an ok turtleneck but after washing it shrunk a bit. The sleeves are shorter and the neck area is very tight. I’m glad I didn’t pay that much for it. It’s a bit disappointing.
3.0,They seem very well made. I wear a 7.5 to 8. I ordered a 7.5. If I order a different color I would go a size bigger. They are tight in the toes.
3.0,Cute dress. Looks like the picture fits well. The only problem is the chemically smell that it still radiates after 3 washes. Not sure what this funk is but definitely hoping it goes away soon.
3.0,"Nice pendent but is arrived broken, very disappointed."
3.0,"I was pleased that it looked like my cousin's original, but the fit wasn't the same. It's stiff and it shrunk after the first wash. The letters are eh, I hope that they don't crumble off. It's also smaller in size, so order up! For the price, it's worth it. Just take care of it."
3.0,"I just used these on a trip that had three legs. On the second leg one of my bags came down the chute without my new tag. My suitcase was fine, so I got to believe the screw came loose. I don't see why anyone would remove a tag with my name on it. Can't blame the tag 100%, so it gets 3 stars. Color is easy to ID and a ballpoint works well to write info. Other tags stayed on."
3.0,"I felt this wasn’t soft and just looked a little cheap. It wasn’t terrible but I did return it, it wasn’t what I was looking for."
3.0,"They're cheap and you can see why. They'll be fine for grubby wear, but I wouldn't ever wear them in public. Fit much tighter than expected."
3.0,Too large for me so returned it.
3.0,"Read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes up - still didn't fit!!!!<br />I typically wear a size 12-14, and I'm 5'2. Tried on the 1XL, too tight everywhere and couldn't zip it up.<br />I would need at least a 2XL."
3.0,"Love the color of these shoes, so I was disappointed that these didn't fit right. They are simultaneously slightly too large  in the heal (large enough that my heal slipped out) and too narrow for my toes (smooshed my big toes in too far)."
3.0,"I gave this item 3 stars because it is a cute Kimono but its longer than I'd like. The minus 2 stars is that they didnt offer xs. I'm 5'2"" and i ordered a small. I felt like I was swimming in it. From the front it was cute but I felt like the back was too long."
3.0,The shirt material is super soft  It’s a shame that’s all I can say about this item. Sent wrong color and size. No one at my house can fit into it. But it’s feels like it would be a good summer shirt because of it’s fabric weight and it’s SO SOFT!
3.0,"Like the design, but the silk is a little thinner than I would have liked."
3.0,"It fits well & is very comfy. Only issue is the seam on the neck looks like it was supposed to align with the seam on the right shoulder but is about an inch behind it. I t looks kind of weird, but I still love this shirt"
3.0,The socks are pretty thin. Probably won't last long.
3.0,I was so excited about this shirt! I needed a cute fall shirt and the leopard pumpkin was perfect. I ordered my usual size and it was wayyy too small. Super bummed. So...cute shirt but you’ll need to order a size or two up. 😥
3.0,"Too small for 6-12 Months old. They fit my four month old great! They don't wash well, they get all pilled even when I have a blanket over them. The rubber peices inside the socks leave red marks and makes me not want to use them very long."
3.0,"I like the overall fit. Fabric is thin, but I didn't have any higher expectation from what the seller described the fabric. I could tell from photo it was thin."
3.0,I’m 122lbs 36A I got small fit good. Hug every part of your body It’s quite comfortable you can move for dancing. The material is thin you can see line of your underwear. I only gave 3 stars because the color paint seems to fade and stretched out so it’s not as vibrant when I put them on. Quite disappointing.
3.0,The fly zipper has to be replaced after wearing 4 times. When delivered the belt was twisted at the back and I'm still trying to find a way to remove it without ripping the seams out. Other than the above I loved them.
3.0,Can barely see the writing on it
3.0,I ordered these Pearl Stud Earrings because they looked so pretty.  I still have them but I have a lot of difficulty putting them on.  I would not buy these again. Packaging and shipping were fine.
3.0,"Material is ok.  The design is not the same as the pictures.  Mine came in with the butterflies, 1 dragonfly on the back n more of the background flowers.  The picture show butterflies n dragonfly on the front, not 1 butterfly n almost half of the dragonfly at the back.  I hope who ever back the item, should check it first before shipping to make sure it’s the same on the pictures."
3.0,Perfect size. Fit everything I needed to take with me to stadium. Strap broke within 2 hrs though. Not sure if mine was defective or if they are all poorly made... You get what you pay for.
3.0,"I am rather petite (usually a size 2 in most brands) with a moderate-sized chest, and this shirt was pretty large on me. I bought the xs, but the waist gapped a fair amount. The chest fit, but had it been any bigger, I couldn't have worn it. If you are a size 2 or below, you might be sized out of this brand or at least this shirt."
3.0,"The buttons are on the wrong side for men. I would have returned them, but they were the first set received while rebuilding my pajama wardrobe.<br /><br />Other than the button problem, I like them but the button issue stopped me from buying every color choice which was my next step."
3.0,"Not as thick as I expected, but looks nice."
3.0,"I really like the style of theses googles, the snap closure is extremely good and comfortable. The case is really sturdy and convenient. I have had problems with water getting in and they fog up very easily. I contacted the seller and immediately was answered and a different style google was sent to me after a series of questions to get the correct fit for me. I have not had an opportunity to try out the new different pair. Very good customer service"
3.0,"Difficult to close, not practical at all"
3.0,Overall ok for the price.
3.0,"Love the variety you get for the price. However, it depends what side your piercing is on. The screw style could be backwards/ upside meaning you cannot put those ones in. The others are good though."
3.0,Very nice but too small. It's really hard to get the card holder in and out.
3.0,"I have been wearing Gold Toe socks for many years now and the quality of them is a bit above average. They last longer than most other socks that I've tried.  I much prefer over the calf type socks as I am not comfortable with the ankle length types and find that crew length socks are always slipping down, which I find even more uncomfortable.  Unfortunately over the calf socks that are not tube socks seem more and more difficult to find, much less in darker colors. Also, white socks look a bit awkward with black shoes in my opinion which is why I purchased these.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not in any manner, an over the calf type sock. They are a standard crew length which ends at mid calf.  I ended up returning them for a refund.  I had no problems doing so, but I was disappointed that they did not fit as stated.<br /><br />Just to be clear, Gold Toe makes a fine pair of socks. They do not wear out quickly and the moisture wicking properties are great, but keep looking if you are going to purchase these because they say that they fit over the calf.  They simply don't."
3.0,"I like it a lot but agree the lace hangs weird, nothing a lil fabric glue or simple stitch can't fix. Still going to wear and love ."
3.0,This sweater is made for slim persons only.
3.0,It is a nice weight for  office wear in the summer months when the air conditioning gets a bit cold.
3.0,Fit as described until they have been washed.  They don't stay up and that drives me crazy.  So they'll be going off in the Goodwill box.
3.0,Ok pins cannot see jw.org. too dark.
3.0,Wished I could give 5 star but I revieved mine broken
3.0,Too big. Gave it away
3.0,"Cute shirt,  but runs small"
3.0,Wasn't bad.
3.0,"A little short for my petite daughter, but she thought it was cute."
3.0,"It says it fits as little as 3 months but my daughter won't be able to fit into it for quite some time. Well made but if you're looking for something for an infant, look elsewhere"
3.0,"Bag is well made, and graphics are well done, but it is too large for 11&#34; Mac Book lap top"
3.0,I’m a 34C and this fit larger than I preferred.
3.0,They don't fit like the others I have gotten from the same company.This pair was a lot smaller . I have to keep tugging to keep them at my waist. I love the colors. You can change your look with the change of a top.
3.0,the design is laser etched so after a while it looks like it fades.
3.0,"I got these a while ago, I usually fit Mediums well all the time but this one is way too big for some reason. I needed them for school so i still wear them. But i wish they were smaller :("
3.0,"Color of top is more of a light orange, not coral. Top has no support so not great for medium chest.  Bottoms fit well, are cute and just like picture."
3.0,Cute but  the cut was wide
3.0,measurements are not according with size chart. Color and design are good.
3.0,They're ok for the money
3.0,i really liked this t-shirt but i had to return it. the material is substantial--it's challenging to find one that is opaque these days! i found the shoulder/bust area to be more form fitting and then the bottom half to just hang in an unattractive way. this would probably work if you have more narrow shoulders or are smaller busted-? worth a shot if you are looking for a non-see-thru shirt since it is free return.
3.0,"It seems like a really nice bracelet, looks great, but less then a week after I got it one of the stones fell out and got lost, luckily I am able to return for a full refund and will try again since everyone else had such great reviews."
3.0,"very thin cloth,you get what you pay for,loose stiching."
3.0,"The belt does NOT latch well. I can get away with wearing it, as long as I'm not too active and I don't lose it somewhere should it pop off.<br />The elastic made it comfortable and easy to wear, and I wondered if it was possibly too loose for me, but it fits snug when I first put it on without any strain or struggle. &#34;Fits like a glove&#34;.... just be prepared for the inevitable unlatching if you twist or lean the wrong way."
3.0,"I loved the previous iteration of Timberland Boat Show Liner no-show socks, but this version is a disappointment. They are not made of the same breathable, thin synthetic fabric but rather a thicker cotton blend that does neither wicks moisture nor prevents odor as effectively as the other. What may be most important is that they show around the sides of my foot when wearing boat shoes, which defeats their entire purpose. They also stick up at my heel because they run larger than their predecessors and I wear a size 9. I will wear them with sneakers but have to find another kind of no-show sock for more general use."
3.0,"I had to return this shirt because the yellow isn't like a light daisy yellow.  It just looks like a faded, dirty light yellow...the picture is a bit deceptive."
3.0,The snap is not substantial. Would be better with velcro
3.0,I'm surprised it came actually a bit larger than the sizing chart predicted which made it hard considering the corset couldn't be tied tighter. Would buy a size smaller next time in order to be able to use the corset properly.<br /><br />The quality of the material is pretty low. The seams are scratchy and irritating and I don't suggest wearing it for long periods of time unless with clothing underneath.<br /><br />The suit looks better for a pirate costume than goth attire unfortunately. Though it did come with a thong? The description neverentioned such an item so we were very confused when it came in the packaging.<br /><br />Overall for the price it's not poor but could be improved with some DIY initiative.
3.0,fingers are made to long and slender for most children to fit into
3.0,"Very dull...no shine, I kept it but I would not buy again."
3.0,Material was nice. The adult ones had gigantic feet which was odd.
3.0,"The sweater is a bit disappointing.  The wool is not as soft as I expected and the zipper is left-handed (I'm a righty).  Also I assumed there would be at least one small pocket somewheres.....I was wrong.  (Yes, I know that the description made no mention of pockets, so I guess it's my fault.).  All is not lost because it does look like the sweater will keep me warm (it closes up right next to the neck) and the price is very reasonable."
3.0,When I'm walking it keeps falling off me
3.0,"The shirts were a good fit and decent material but the neckline on one of them is messed up. The black and red shirt are fine, the front opening is perfectly aligned but the gray shirt is all the way to the left. It looks horrible."
3.0,Color not as advertised. More of a pea green but material is nice
3.0,Fits good just to scratchy. Not enough fabric on the in side.
3.0,"It's definitely thinner than I expected and, as others have pointed out, not a sweatshirt. The fit is decent enough, and the fabric is soft, but I wish it were a little thicker material."
3.0,"I purchased a S/M per the sizing chart. These still fit not as snug as expected, especially around the ankle and instep area. They were easy to get on and off. Didn't work for me."
3.0,The fabric isn't good swimming fabric -- I can tell compared to my Nike jammers that the chlorine in the pool water would destroy these pretty fast. But if you have a great ass and work out in a gym where you want to flaunt it...
3.0,"Great design. Bright, true colors. Run small. Thin and are getting holes after a few wearings."
3.0,Too squishy and unstable for people with balance problems.  Not much actual support.  Needs a vibrant sole for stability.
3.0,"nowhere in the product description stated this is a two pieces set... and the &#34;blink&#34; tank is only 5-6 inch in length.  I am worry when I wear it out the gap between pieces.  SUGGESTION... if have to be two piece, the inside piece should be a full tank.  If to stay as it... they should be somehow stitch together."
3.0,A couple of these are really pretty but most of them are super cheap looking.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.
3.0,I was disappointed that the clip didn't stay on better ! It kept coming off. Need a stronger grip than this !
3.0,Shoulders too big... has to be taken in.
3.0,These served a purpose for an 80's birthday party. The con's are that it took a long time to get them and they ripped pretty easily.
3.0,"Definitely bulky, but warm and cozy after washing it.  I will likely only wear it when we have another Florida cold snap.  Definitely not out for a date night with my husband again though."
3.0,Too plain thought it had more elegance
3.0,Way to small. I usually order a medium and this fit right under my boobs.
3.0,"I like the look and style of it but it was way too small.  Could barely get my arm in to it.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 185 lbs with athletic build and there's no way i could get this on unless I lost 40 pounds."
3.0,I am giving it a three star rating because the picture on the shoe is not like it was shown i ordered the wolf pair the moon is at the bottom of the shoe and the wolf is on top of the shoe it the dame way on both pairs so it kinda looks weird that the moon is on the out side on one and the inside on the other and rhe wolf is howling rhe same way on both
3.0,This product was really cute in the picture. But when I got it i had a hard time finding a way to have it stay on my ear. It would constantly fall off. It made me upset to think i wasted money on something that I thought would be an awesome peice of jewlery.
3.0,The sleepwear is soft & comfortable
3.0,I found these a poor quality
3.0,I had to return it. I ordered one size up and it still seemed too small. the split was higher than it appears in picture. I did not want my abdomen visible.
3.0,"Flimsy and will probably not hold it's shape, although I have not as yet had the opportunity to wear the belt.  I could not recommend."
3.0,I liked the design of the slipper. The fabric is nice but the memory foam did not meet my expectations. It is not thick enough.
3.0,"Quality is less than expected. A couple seams are coming apart after only wearing it twice (I've had it for about three weeks). It fits smaller than I thought it would. I'm usually a small and bought a medium so I could layer, fits more like a small. Images are screen printed, so if you're looking for embroidered look somewhere else. Won't be replacing it with this seller."
3.0,They were nice and soft and fit but there was a long stain down the butt to thighs.
3.0,"I was very excited for this shirt to wear to my Halloween party but when I received it, it was too small. It fit very tight around my arms and was too short. I suggest GO UP A SIZE! It was super soft though and cute!"
3.0,"This dress is very well made. Nice, sturdy fabric. Not cheap. Sadly, it is too small. Not really meant for someone with a big chest. I'm a 44D and it was too tight to zip up. Made me sad bc it is a very nice dress. I'm going to have to return it. :( shipping was on time. Product is great. If only it would've fit."
3.0,"Nice, but heavier than I expected.  Very comfortable; a classy, casual look."
3.0,Its a cute top but runs BIG
3.0,"They're cute, and my son liked the look. But he said they weren't very comfortable. So he doesn't wear them."
3.0,"Super cute and fits all of my cards, change, and cash. My only complaint is that the card slots are starting to tear and stretch out after only a few months causing my cards to fall out of the wallet."
3.0,"I have only worn 2 times and I noticed a small hole.  and there is a stitching defect on the top of one . Too bad , I know these wont hold up very well."
3.0,It's too small and the strap was missing
3.0,"The hat has a nice fit and looks very durable but looks too Safari/ Park Ranger. I plan on putting a black ribbon around it, hopefully that helps."
3.0,"Very cheap looking! However, you get what you pay for...."
3.0,I did NOT like the fit and fabric.  It came up really high on my leg and it didn’t stay up.  It would slide down.  I returned.
3.0,"I’m between a size 9.5 and 10 in shoes.<br />I have skinny feet hence why I am in between sizes<br />They only had these platform cowgirl boots in a size 11 and based on the reviews I decided to take the risk and order an 11.<br />I tried them on with very thin socks (like the little ankle socks you wear with vans and slip ons) and these shoes fit perfectly except, they were a little too narrow in the toe area. Which I found surprising since my feet are narrow. These size 11’s fit like a lot of size 10 boots I’ve gotten off of Amazon.<br /><br />As for looks, 10/10 they’re adorable. But quality wise, they’re soooo cheap. They are like a weird foam material (the entire boot) not like a regular leather. They kind of feel like I’m wearing styrofoam shoes. The heel is also very light and cheap. If you weigh more than an “average sized adult” I don’t think these shoes would hold up after 1-2 wears. They’re TOO light weight. I’m 163lbs and not sure how long they’ll last me walking around on the town..<br /><br />Because these shoes are $50 and practically entirely made out of styrofoam, along with being 1-1.5 sizes smaller than listing size, I cannot in good conscious give these 5 stars.<br />Like I said, I love the look. And I’m very excited to go to the cowboy bar living my best emo cowgirl life, but for $50 cannot recommend spending the $ on them."
3.0,It is so pretty but is little  small .
3.0,3 star since the screw together pieces require some attention to be aligned so that they will screw together. this is potentially due to the harness of the plastic.
3.0,The earrings themselves aware beautiful but I gave up on trying to put them in when I decided that my nails were too long to hold the earring.
3.0,I am not a fan of the bland yellow color of the rose and it doesnt seem easy to take it off for painting.
3.0,"These shoes are so cute, looks nice, it will feel cool in Summer.<br />I order a normal size based on the size chart, the length is good, but it's too tight at the instep, my daughter felt uncomfortable when she tried, and after that, she never wanted to wear them again."
3.0,Comes with many varieties but it’s hard to open the circle ones without pliers.<br />The half open ones I think are made for the left side of ur nose
3.0,Two  pair were defective
3.0,"The product is awesome, but the shipping was a month late."
3.0,These are beautiful and well made boots.  They run small and fit really tight.  The heel is a good height.  If your feet run closer to narrow - these will work for you.
3.0,Ok.. lenses rattle in frame.
3.0,The fringes were all tangled
3.0,"Nice, stylish warm jacket. Zipper quality is low, old-style metal type. They also sent me the brown color when I ordered green (I checked)."
3.0,"I got the silver pair and they are cute, not as big as I was wanting. Disappointed with the fit on me. The sides of the glasses angled down when placed on my head which made the bottom of the frames stick out away from my face and look silly, they are on their way back to Amazon 🙁 The lenses are mirrored and came with a cleaning cloth and a nice hard case."
3.0,I like the lace part. The only bad thing about it being more of a “skirt” rather than being a camisole is that it flares out a bit.
3.0,Nice bracelet. Don't like the strong smell to metal.
3.0,I went a size up. I recommend to go up two sizes
3.0,"El vestido en si es súper lindo, queda muy bien y se ajusta perfecto. Mi única crítica y la razón de mi puntuación, es el lazo del cuello, es demasiado grueso y se ve demasiado grande para mi gusto, ojalá fuesen un poco más finas las tiras para que así no quedase tan abultado el lazo"
3.0,It’s pretty but the material is cheap and it’s better for tall skinny people
3.0,"Cheap earrings, you get what you pay for afterall. The black ones are falling apart out of he package."
3.0,Very thin material and I had to take in the sides to fit my hips and thighs better. However it's a Very sexy dress.
3.0,"Fits a tad large, but not bad, the material feels kinda cheap but is still pretty comfortable. What I didn't like is that the camo print was only on the front, the whole back was the same green as the side panel."
3.0,The posts poke at the back of my neck.  I keep bending them down but afraid they will break off sooner than later.
3.0,"I really do love these! I do wish I got a size up sense my chest does pops through sometimes, I am a 32C.<br />They’re really comfortable and they look really cute again just wish they fit a little more comfortably so I wouldn’t have to fuss with them."
3.0,Ok product fot the price. Arrived missing an earring back. They don't come up the ear as far as in the  picture. One side doesn't like to stay clipped.
3.0,"My husband hated this shirt. I read the reviews and everyone says a size up, my husband is 180 and has a stomach, so I purchased the Xl, he says the vneck was too far down. Three stars because I still like the baby blue color and the thin material of the shirt, but hubby hated it, so I will rewrap for a family member for Christmas"
3.0,Is not the expected wind breaker beware read the comments and my medium top was a bit tight in the arms but will do it’s not too bad i love the look anyway it’s cute
3.0,Too big for a newborn. My 4 month old with a larger size head still cannot wear them. Very cute and cannot wait to accessorize when they fit.
3.0,"Made well, but they run real small get two sizes bigger ,had to return this product"
3.0,"The print is a lot fuzzier/pixelated than the picture, so this was pretty disappointing. Also the boobs are a lot higher than a normal persons boobs."
3.0,I still will keep but this one was a good three inches shorter then the previous one I had ordered and just all around snugger! Normally the size I ordered is on the big size and this was snug!
3.0,"These appear to be well made but run a little small.  I would not go up in size but they are tighter than expected.  My only real issue is the waistband casing, the waist elastice is approximately 1"" wide but the casing is 2"" wide this allows twisting and turning which requires adjustment after each washing.  Do NOT put in dryer."
3.0,"Bought these for a trip to iceland in September 2018 and as soon as i pulled them (when i was in Iceland) on the button fell off. I ended up returning. Had the button not fell off , these would have been great."
3.0,"It is very cute, small ties for the waist. Better sized for a teen or child. Extra strings from stitching I had to remove before using."
3.0,These fell apart after one month<br /><br />We buy nikes every time for our kids and these ones just didn’t hold up for some reason
3.0,"I was expecting it to be a bit longer due to some diagrams I had seen, but overall it's a pretty good necklace"
3.0,"Average quality, last only 1 day, not what I was expected"
3.0,"Looks great, but I wish it was better material for the price paid. It probably will not last many washes but I really enjoy the design. Would order more if they were a little cheaper! Great concert tank"
3.0,Way too small. Get one to two sized bigger<br />Luckily I was able to return the pants and get a full refund
3.0,Very delicate not for the family people with kids
3.0,Yes this is very uncomfortable to actually wear buy may look pretty pictures I hope!
3.0,"These are very stylish and very sturdy, but my eyes can still be seen from the other side. This makes me feel like they are cheap because of this reason. Do these really have UVA/UVB protection? My eyes do feel 10 times better when I wear them outside so maybe they do but I better buy something more expensive."
3.0,"Just meh...not much compression at all. I like to feel my tummy snuggly held in, but still be able to breath. These don’t really do that. I’m sure the lines on the butt are flattering for someone with a round rear...I’m not that person so it looks odd on my flat behind! The pass the squat test, but just meh."
3.0,Quality = price.  Good for a party but lenses pop out way too easily.
3.0,They are not antifog?
3.0,"These liner socks are very cute. I wear them with ballet flats, and love the little lace that shows. I gave these socks 3 stars because they are too small. I wear a size 8.5, and I can just fit my feet in these. The first pair I wore got a hole near the toe because it was stretched too much. If these socks were just an inch or so bigger, I’d give them five stars."
3.0,Very nice product but extremely snug/tight
3.0,My daughter love them but the buttons wouldnt stay buttoned
3.0,"Not what I was expecting, and not very shiny at all.  Just ok.  The hoop wires were actually too large to fit comfortably in my ears,"
3.0,"I typically dressed as Michael Jackson every year for Halloween.  Since the year 2020 has been a sketchy one to say the least, I ended up not wearing it after all but I did prance in this costume earlier in the day of Halloween and got an astonishing compliment on how it fitted my body.  So I will wear it again next year at different events."
3.0,"Lower part of dress seemed faded and ""worn, looking. Still nice but not what expected."
3.0,A littler smaller than other under armour capris I have bought in the same size.
3.0,"the stitching was too tight so it squeezed my butt and sides in uncomfortable ways, size up! i got this same bikini from shein in a small, it fit me perfectly but i got a medium from here and it was too small."
3.0,"I did like the dress, but it comes small on size"
3.0,"Good value, glasses fit well but bridge area was too strong for my liking. Ultimately returned item."
3.0,Nice thick and probably warm. Bought them to try under ski pants. I knew they would be too short as I am almost 6 feet tall but they have no stretch whatsoever and when I bent my knees and sat up a little they slid right off my butt
3.0,"The boot is well made, and the leather feels like silk. However, the hidden platform is higher than it looks in the picture making it impractical. I walk in 3 1/2"" to 4"" heels everyday, but walking in this boot was difficult due to the platform's inflexibility. Felt very awkward."
3.0,I thought it was suede but it wasn’t. It took forever to arrive the company os suppose to be Australian but it says made in India. I don’t think I’ll buy from them again this hat costs $3 at a store near me and I paid way to much to wait so long for a plain mesh hat. Misleading.
3.0,"I love everything about the wallet, but it is difficult to get anything out of it when you need it.  All the slots are just a wee bit too small."
3.0,The color was good liked the boot overall
3.0,"By looking at the model wearing these pants,  I figured they should be long enough for someone 5'6"". Wrong !  Just a heads up, they were way too short. Otherwise they fit,  but quite snug. The quality was fine and they would have been cute. Very bell bottom tho,  much more than the photo shows."
3.0,Esta mas omenos
3.0,"Seem like well made jeans and have nice protection in them especially for the price point.  However, they fit like skinny jeans and are just too tight for me to get on in my normal size.  Am trying up 1 size next."
3.0,"I'm 5'11"" and a size 4/6 with a straight figure.  I bought this sweater in Small, but I did return it.  I wasn't expecting the shape of the sweater.  It doesn't really look like the pictures.  It's cropped short and the bottom band is fitted, although the sweater is true to size.  The sleeves are exaggerated batwings and with the banded cropped bottom create almost a balloon like shape.  I am tall with a small bust and it really didn't work on me, but I think the sweater would work on someone shorter and bustier.  It could be cute, just wasn't on me."
3.0,"Very nice looking, elegant tie bar - but much too wide for today's tie styles.  My husband couldn't even use it for the occasion we bought it for although he kept it as someday wide ties may come back in style (and it's a pain to send back... )"
3.0,I'm bigger busted and it just didn't work for me.
3.0,Please make xxlarge n xxxlarge so many of us will be happy 😃 please ‼️Please I’m waiting for that day for this jacket.love love it
3.0,Chain very thin and flimsy.  However price is right
3.0,I wrapped it up as a baby present and didn’t realize there were stains on a few of the items? I don’t know how that happened. Cute but thin.
3.0,"I know this is a men's size, but it was way too long even on my 6'1&#34; boyfriend, so I had to get the bottom. Within 4 months, the colors were all fading and the back seam was coming apart."
3.0,"Cute and nice accessory.  After first wear the metal on the back of my neck changed colors. As long as that part stays hidden, then the necklace will look nice.  I wouldn't wear with my hair up going forward."
3.0,"Very soft and warm, and I love the design on the front. That said, I bought a large. It fits like a medium, and the bottom hemline is rather short, so it hits right at the belt loops. I usually wear a medium, but prefer my sweatshirts be a bit baggy, which this is not."
3.0,Cute. But I wish it was looser. I don’t have much hair ☹️ and my head is not oversized.
3.0,These seem and feel like they are of great quality but my order was incorrect. Sadly I was sent 2 greens instead of my 1. purple 1. Green & 1. Navy blue. Disappointed because I really wanted my Navy Blue. Otherwise it’s good.
3.0,"It didn't fit, I ordered my ring size and it was too small. You might wanna order one size up. It looks real, and I liked it a lot. Too much trouble to return, so I gave it to my sister in law."
3.0,"I LOVE the way the back of this shirt is cut. It's really cute. I had to return it because it's too sheer for me to wear without a bra and I don't use padding. Honestly, you aren't supposed to wear a bra with this shirt and I don't need one, except due to sheerness. I wish it came in a darker color or had lining in the front so it wasn't so sheer. Otherwise, very cute!"
3.0,Still cant tell whether this is truly ceramic or just some cheap metal or even plastic knockoff.
3.0,Runs small very thin
3.0,I love how it fits. I do have to wear a tank underneath to cover.
3.0,Super cute but way small
3.0,See thru.  I was expecting something cotton like and not so much of polyester.
3.0,I liked the dress just snug in a few places...
3.0,"cheaply made, fell apart after a few washes and shrunk about 1-2 sizes after washing."
3.0,"Good quality, but I bought them based on another review saying they were large, and they're not.  They're really fairly small in both width and height, kind of snug on my head."
3.0,I am a size 18. I returned the dress as I didnt like the way it fit me especially since I am a G cup. Just fit weird.
3.0,The buckle on the band is a bit large. The pin holding the buckle to the watch band broke so I had to get it replaced. I like the replacement buckle better than the original because it's a little smaller and the piece that fits into the holes on the band is a little longer. The band itself is fine if you like them thick.
3.0,"I WANTED TO LOVE THIS, BUT I GOT THE 5X AND IT WAS A BIT TOO SMALL, I WILL TRY TO GET SMALL ENOUGH TO WEAR IT, BUT I WAS SADLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SMALL SIZING.<br /><br />SHIPPING WAS FAST ENOUGH AND THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN AND I HOPE IT HELPS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT!.<br /><br />[...]"
3.0,It fit pretty large. I have gained a lot of weight and got the Xl and it was really too big. I have to order another type of dress for my trip this weekend but I would order this again without hesitation after I lose a few pounds. I love the pockets
3.0,Like the shoes very comfortable however runs a little big needed a smaller size
3.0,I purchased this curved barbell for my rook piercing.  Once I was able to get it into the piercing hole the threads were barely through the piercing hole. It definitely needs to be a 8mm or 10mm length barbell.
3.0,Nice quality. Bought for my dad but they were  too tight around the ankles for him.
3.0,Super cute. My aunt gave us a pack of these. Fit is perfect for 4-7yrs old. So I ordered another set to have double and 2 were huge and didn't fit and 1 fit perfect. I am guessing a quality control issue. Going to get a replacement. Fingers crossed.
3.0,So ridiculously cute! But huge 😶 so I gave it to a coworker.
3.0,"I'm not terribly disappointed with this tunic, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. The color isn't quite as vibrant as the photo. The material is thinner than I'd hoped, but very flowy and not at all clingy (which I love). Length is great to wear with leggings."
3.0,"such an adorable suit, but unfortunately it is very short!  I am 5' 9 36DD.  It fits ok in the bust, but is not long enough even if I tie it super tight.  Not recommended or tall girls."
3.0,Clasp is poor.  Doesn't like to stay closed.  Everything else is well done.
3.0,little flimsy but for the price ok
3.0,"I have been looking for some white framed aviators for awhile & this was all I could find. They are cute & fit fine, but unfortunately, the lens on one side pops out constantly, so they are basically useless."
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 36 C, 28 waist. I ordered this in a size small. It’s fits alright, although the sleeves aren’t as oversized like the rest of it. The cut isn’t as flattering as some of my other crop hoodies. It’s ok but not really what I was hoping for."
3.0,"It's frayed a bit more than I'd have hoped, in the three years I've owned it.  I haven't used it all that much, either; I usually wear a different watch than the one it's on."
3.0,"Way too big for me, but I fold it and make it work."
3.0,"One is to small, the other is closer but way to tight on my arm."
3.0,It didn’t clean my sons shoes like we thought it would.
3.0,"Basically, the mask is everything the product image shows. Mine came broken, but that was fine, I was modifying my mask anyway but prepare to possibly need to pick up some string.<br />Overall, did what it should and was worth the money spent.<br /><br />Edges are a little sharp so if you're putting this on a child with soft skin, be careful."
3.0,"I got these for my young kids so they wouldn't lose masks as often. But the gaiters don't stay up well, so they end up wearing them as scarves. Defeats the purpose."
3.0,"My son loved these water socks unfortunately they only lasted three wears. The front toe stitching came undone after the third wear. I wanted to leave 5 stars just for the fact that my son loved them for the waterparks and the beach, wish they were made better."
3.0,"Good for price and short term use.  We used for 1 month of Nutcracker.  They held up good! Started to thin out very quickly though!  If you need for a short period and want to save money, get these!"
3.0,Well they're from China. They are ok and don't seem to wick away moisture that well. Also have an odor to them even after washing.
3.0,"Well made, but it was a bit too large so I had to cut them down to fit in my shoes.  Tried them out and they were very uncomfortable not what I had hoped for."
3.0,It was nice when I had it it kept falling off and I lost it
3.0,"This is a beautiful shoe, with a great sole, but I'm returning it.  The toe region is too narrow for my foot. Usually Ecco and Merrell fit my foot well, and I'll have to stick with those brands."
3.0,"I've bought A LOT of stuff from Amazon and only had to return 1 item. So, I try to write a review for everything I buy because I find that reviews can be super helpful in buying things off of the web because it's hard to tell from pictures if the product is good or not. With this being said, this bracelet comes stiff. I thought it would be soft. It is pretty, it's my favorite color :) and I love the designs. I just don't like that it's stiff."
3.0,It is a comfortable alternative to wearing a bra around the house. They do run a bit on the small side but is still comfortable. I wouldn't find them comfortable enough to sleep in. They wash well and they wear well
3.0,"These earrings are nice and well-made, but they are larger than I thought they would be, and they pull down on my earlobes a bit. They're more like 2.3 inches across - almost 2.5. I contacted the seller to return them. The seller wrote back very quickly and was happy to offer me a return, but then I realized that I had to pay for shipping both ways. I could either be out $13 and keep the earrings, or be out $10 with no earrings. I decided to keep them, and either learn to wear bigger earrings or give them to a big-earring-loving friend."
3.0,"My kiddo has a longer torso so I order 10-12 (shes 9), but this 10-12 was still slightly too short.  Cut a little funny at the bottom.  Ride up her rear and the front didn’t have as much coverage as she likes."
3.0,"I know companies always say “colors could vary because of monitor/screen” but this came and was a super bright green. Not dark or emerald at all. Was not authentic for Winnie Sanderson if that’s what you’re getting it for and want your costume to match hers. Good for just a quick costume that will get the character across, but I like my costumes to be as realistic and authentic as I can get them and this wasn’t it.<br />Quality of construction wasn’t bad or anything. Just gave it 3 stars as it wasn’t what I expected."
3.0,"Truly a matter of opinion with this one. I ordered two, one for me and one for my mother-in-law. She loved hers. Me on the other hand, not so much. She’s an average C cup and it gives her the support with the level of comfort sh expected. While I am a solid D cup and it didn’t give me much support at all. I think it’s a perfect simple and comfortable style for women with a smaller chest. While was comfortable and maybe I could’ve kept it to sleep in, it wasn’t providing the support I wanted for an everyday t-shirt style, lounge bra."
3.0,Hats were cute but cheaply made. The light necklace was much bigger than it appeared in pictures. Actual c9 bulb size. Very clunky. Mini lights would have been better.
3.0,One pair out of the package was stitched wrong and hello hallway mat so I had to throw one pair away so I didn't get my money's worth other than that the other ones are fine they ran a little bit small
3.0,"The sunglasses look ok and the color is as expected. The fit's a little loose. Lens surface is larger than I'd hoped and not as dark as I'd expected but they do reduce glare. Frames are very lightweight plastic construction except for metal screws, centers of hinges, and maybe the decoration. Frame plastic feels hard & brittle, as though it might easily shatter—if it turns out to be more durable than it seems and the lenses & hinges hold up well, these won't have been a bad buy."
3.0,"Cute skirt, good fit, great length, hits just below the knee. It’s not the best material, with a thin synthetic feel, and it collects lint like crazy. But other than having to run a lint brush over it for five minutes before each wear, it looks great and wears well."
3.0,Returned for style
3.0,The singly part didn’t last long but I like it still
3.0,I ordered the red and it is not the color that is shown in the picture. More like a red/orange. Fits good just disappointed in the color.
3.0,"This is a one piece set. When it arrived I checked out the quality right away and wasn’t blown away. It’s fine for what it is but I feel the pricing is a little high for what you get. Something like this can be purchased pretty much anywhere that sells baby clothing, or even with better quality... with a much lower price tag. But what I do like about this outfit for my baby girl is the fact that it’s one piece and easy to get on and off. I won’t be using it quite yet. But will be using it next year when she’s a little older."
3.0,"This purse is really nice...That being said, it really does smell. I read the other reviews about it. I Love the smell of leather. Bring it on. I brought it in and it was pretty cold. As it warms up...oh my goodness! That's not any leather smell I've ever smelled. I actually had to put it in another room. LOL I know the smell will fade, the purse itself is Awesome. Just what I wanted."
3.0,Ok hoodie - I expectted it to be heavier but it is super light weight and fits small.
3.0,"Disappointed, I expected a floor length dress and it’s wayyyy too short in the front. I’m 5’4 and ordered a small, so maybe I should have sized up. It’s cute but not what I wanted."
3.0,Cute but I don't think it's actually stainless steel. The  outer silver coating came off and it became more of a dull brown color.
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch, as I have several of them, with different colored dials, and different finishes. It is an obvious homage to a well known higher tier watch that starts with &#34;B&#34;.  All of mine kept good time, and they worked well, but after a while, all had a fatal flaw. The case back is stainless steel, but the case itself is plated base metal, and the plating on all of mine started to wear off where the back and sides of the case touched your wrist, after only a matter of months of daily wear. This watch would be worth twice as much, if only the case were made of stainless steel, as that would prevent this from happening. I have also thought that maybe using a nato-style strap might help either delay the wear, or protect the finish longer, as they would provide some barrier between the back of the watch and your skin. It's a shame, as it's otherwise a great looking watch, that works well and for a bargain price."
3.0,"Stitching wasn't so good, one of the slits came off during trying it on. Easy sew fix though"
3.0,"Pouch is somewhat small and tight. I usually wear US L, but for these I would definitely need XL. Too bad they do not have it."
3.0,"needed a bigger chain for my neck, it does not glow real bright, but it does glow."
3.0,"Barely fits. I've been size 34 for over 20 years, and this belt is tight on the first hole. Nice looking belt, but get a size big."
3.0,It’s beautiful but the gold fades away with a couple of washes
3.0,It look good but the mm is smaller then said.
3.0,"I am short and not thick and these things were way too short! I bought two of these, one for me and a friend for a costume and we both had to cut the feet so we could wear it. Otherwise they were comfortable and fun to wear, but of course we could only wear them once."
3.0,This coat was supposed to be a size XL 18-20 but I'm pretty sure it was a size 12-14.  Cute coat but I had to send it back since it was too small for my eleven-year-old son.
3.0,It's not a heavy sweater at all. But it's still nice.
3.0,Also ordered three shirts from Tommy Bahama.com..quality of these seems different? Not sure they are authentic Tommy.
3.0,"Like how the material feels when I put them on, but they do seem to run a bit small (I ordered an XL).  I'm 5ft8in tall, and the length is good.  Might want to order a size up if you order them."
3.0,"Hole is too small to put a necklace through, return"
3.0,"They're billed as XL, but they really don't stack up to other XL sunglasses I've owned. They also feel pretty cheap, but at the end of day, they do fit reasonably and keep the sun out of my eyes."
3.0,"There isn't anything close to this price available, and the materials are not of substandard quality, which is the only reason I didn't give this 2 stars.  Unfortunately, the zipper breaking on the very first use wasn't what I was hoping for.  The bottom edges on these run a little higher than comparable models, and your feet will get wet via bottom splash-up unless your shoes have a waterproof element near the sole of your shoe."
3.0,"I loved this item, but I only wore it 4 times and it got a hole in the arm pit of the sleeve already."
3.0,I guess its ok.  It is not the dress I ordered however. :(.  I ordered a blue dress and I received a black dress the company refused to switch it out for me
3.0,This is a bit square and large.  Picture on site is deceiving.
3.0,Heavier than it looks; if your ears are sensitive or you don't often wear heavy earrings this might bother you. It is quite pretty but I haven't found an occasion to wear it--and again it is very heavy.
3.0,It was terribly cute material. But it does not fit anyone with a c cup or larger.
3.0,"I like the way they look, but they need backs. I wore them to dinner and they slipped out from my ear into the table three times in one hour!"
3.0,Good quality but doesn’t come with as many variations as it says it does. Kinda boring and a little dirty too
3.0,This would be a great product if the pin that holds it together would stay in my son lost it after a week of us resecuring the pin over and over
3.0,"Fun looking little earrings for my daughter, but they are TINY - like REALLY TINY. Probably better for an infant..."
3.0,Tshirts looks nice but it is way too big. I ordered an XS for my 4.5 year old that usually wears a size 4-5 and a S for my 7 year old that usually wears a size 6. The XS is too big for both of them.
3.0,Lens optics were good. Frames seemed sturdy but broke within a few weeks.
3.0,Soft. I'm sure there is spandex but the tag says 100% COTTON. No way. It feels more synthetic with stretch. I'm 5' and it falls just above my knees.
3.0,"These are a weird bathing suit material that is stretchy but the weight of it is not what I was expecting.  I have never purchased an article of clothing that was made of this material before.  I probably never will again on purpose. The pattern/design is nice and the fit is fine. It's just that I was looking for something more breathable and loose-fitting than leggings/yoga pants to wear around the house and possibly sleep in that wasn't as heavy as sweatpants. These are neither warm nor cool due to the weird weight and drape of the fabric. Due to the entire garment being elastic-y, they tend to ride up.  At least they have pockets so I can put my hands in there and pull them down.  I just ordered some other lounge and pajama pants and looked more closely at the fabric and materials description after this experience.  I definitely won't be sleeping in these. Will wear around the house this summer and see how they do in the heat."
3.0,Cuando las compré decía que era para serie 8 pero a mi reloj le quedaron grandes y mi reloj es serie 8
3.0,"has spots, perhaps returned previously..."
3.0,Lo compre una talla más pero igual me quedo pequeño
3.0,"too frumpy, sizing not accurate"
3.0,Material was of acceptable quality but the size was the reason for return. Otherwise would have kept.
3.0,3 x seems<br />Ike a 1x
3.0,This is the second one of these belts i have bought. The other lasted about 2 years and one of the pins holding the buckle together broke. I was pretty happy with how it held up. The one i just bought to replace it is not doing as well. The buckle does not bite into the leather as well causing it to slip. The leather seems softer than the last one. I am not sure if they changed the material.
3.0,"It is a great shirt, but it is VERY small for the size listed.  I normally wear a Large or XL. I ordered an XL, and it was just too small. I gave the shirt to someone smaller, and ordered a XXL because I really liked it. Even the XXL is a little too short, and is tight across the shoulders.  If they made a XXL I would probably go ahead and get it, but they don't seem to.  ORDER IT AT LEAST TWO SIZES LARGER THAN YOU USUALLY WEAR!!!"
3.0,"First off, I really like the material and fit. It was exactly what I was looking for, unfortunately after one use and wash, there was a hole on one of the tanks. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but because of this, can't give a full 5 star.  :("
3.0,"Although the necklace is beautiful and just as described in the description, the crystal fell off with a few hours of me wearing it for the first time. I was able to fix it by replacing the ring that connects it to the necklace. I still wear it in a daily basis and haven't had an issue with since I fixed it."
3.0,Nice top. Because I am short it fit like a dress. Not my type of top.
3.0,Its.... AIIGHT. Picture looks better but kept it cause its different and I will dress it up with jewlry
3.0,"The leggings run big, I got a small/medium bc I’m usually in a medium but with these I feel like I’d need an actual small. And they are super long, I’m 5’2 and they go way past my feet."
3.0,Didn’t fit watch
3.0,I've ordered these glasses before and love them so this is probably my 5th pair. However I think I got faulty ones this time because the piece that goes over your ear broke off just after 2 uses.  And I'm very easy on my glasses.
3.0,"This necklace is cute and sturdy.  However it is fairly evident that this is low cost from the feel of the metal to the color of the metal.  The links are attached well though and it is cute, it would be perfect for a kid.  The gift box and description card it is on makes it a nice gift."
3.0,fit was off... snaps in a weird spot. snaps fell off of BOTH styles i purchased :(
3.0,Drawstring is too short.
3.0,Really cute and all but still some what small I also don't really like the white part on the front I did not think it had it but it does right where the cleavage is
3.0,The post are really thick and hard to put in. They work!
3.0,Ears don't really stay up. The fur is not soft at all and sheds. This is very low quality and I wouldn't buy it with high hopes. The inner lining is a very cheap and thin version of velvet and already looks like it's going to wear down within a few uses.
3.0,These are as-advertised.  ...they don't come close to quality.  Pay more and purchase 'HIGH QUALITY MICROFIBER POUCH' by 'BIRCH'.  You'll be thrilled with them.  These you'll be simply satisfied with or slightly disappointed with...
3.0,shrink!!!
3.0,"It looks better in the picture, not that I dislike it, but on the picture it looks a lot more refind.  But I have to remember it does say Bohemia Vintage.  I think it can only be worn very casually.  I do like the design and color combination.  I was just disappointed....but then I do recall how terribly cheap this was......which I don’t understand either.  Was this a trial with this company?"
3.0,"I ordered 2 pair & neither pair had pockets.<br />total disappointment, the shipping was quicker than expected which was nice.<br />but really only bought them because the description says they had pockets.<br />I can't speak on the fit because these were not for me."
3.0,There cool but you gave me wrong size so I gave em away
3.0,"So, this dress is VERY comfortable on me. If the straps were adjustable, I would give this another star. I think it NEEDS that option. That being said, it is very light and flowy and fit me like I thought it would. I am 5' 6.5&#34;, 180 lbs, 36 DD, mostly coke bottle figure. I bought the XL because some reviews said it ran smaller.<br /><br />The other bridesmaids said that I could most likely have fit into a L, but I think that maybe a L would have been too tight around the armpits. It's almost unflattering when worn by itself, I think, but when I put a cute belt on to make it into more of an empire waist, it looked great. I got the 'Apricot' color and I would really just call it a beige."
3.0,Way big !!
3.0,Not worth the money for one sleeve. Basically the same price as Nike sleeves.
3.0,"The belt buckle is small, it has bubbles on each corner like it was made at home or something, not terrible but not professional by any means."
3.0,"When it arrived I was surprised by the volume of the cotton skirt. It was extremely wrinkled and unless I want to iron and starch it, it will not be able to be worn. I will need to return."
3.0,It's a halter dress for the SUMMER yet it's a sweater fabric for the Winter.  So I'll die of heat in the summer and freeze in the winger.  Hmmmmm?!?!?!?!
3.0,This is just an okay bag. The quality feels fine. The metal tag of the manufacturer is on the outside and it is very crooked which is a shame because I was going to use it for a small Christmas gift but it just doesn't look right. When I ordered the bag my arrival date wasn't supposed to be for a few weeks but it arrived in about 3 days. Some products from China have a funky smell but this did not. I have it 3 stars because of the crooked tag.
3.0,Has chemical odor. And I wish I would've read the materials. It's polyester/rayon type of material
3.0,Cute but runs a bit too large.
3.0,This skirt is very soft. However the black looks ashy gray as if he was washed and faded.
3.0,"Nice color, itchy material and feels a bit cheap. Pretty disappointing."
3.0,Leather rope came loose from the first coupling on the tope of the bracelet after a couple of wearings.  Was able to carefully glue back together with jewelry leather glue.
3.0,It's like being wrapped in a heavy bear rug. Can't wait for winter to test it out.
3.0,"This jacket had a smell I couldn’t get out, I washed it twice and I love that it was nice and light wasn’t to heavy"
3.0,"I'd advise that you buy a half-size bigger. They really aren't very comfortable. As they look so nice, you really have to suffer to get through the day wearing them."
3.0,"Very comfortable but not a shirt for going out in, too big."
3.0,"This is a nice looking pendant, but the picture and description look and say it's violet, but the color is much more fuchsia pink."
3.0,Black girls with butts do one size up.  Cute but very small.
3.0,A little more stiff than the average retainers bought at local shops but the price is unmatched. The retaining rubber loops however do not seat well on the retainer causing them to be lost throughout use frequently. Beyond that happy with the purchase.
3.0,Arm holes are an awkward size/shape. Gap in the front. I have a larger chest.
3.0,Little disappointed 😔
3.0,"I wear 40 inch waist pants.<br />Sizing chart translated XL. Sizing chart is way wrong.  About 2 sizes too small.  Gave them to my wife so she could use as sleep shorts, they are that small. Fabric is soft and look well made though.  Wish they offered a 3XL size, maybe then they would fit my 40 inch waist."
3.0,Needs to be redesigned.  Keeps breaking at the snap in point
3.0,"Daughter was happy with item,was disappointed with not receiving it before Christmas"
3.0,"These are very, very small. I bought them as a gift for my husband who is 6'3, long torso and 32 inch waist. I got him the XL in these and the pouch is just ridiculously small. However they look incredibly sexy on him and I'm glad I got them but if you're bigger than a 32 they probably won't fit. As usual, I paid full price for the item and this is not a sponsored review."
3.0,I like them but too small
3.0,"I expected better quality, but it's ok. It was a gift for my father."
3.0,"I purchased these for a homeless outreach event, and at the time they were advertised as socks. It should be noted that about half of the socks in this pack were actual socks (mostly women's, and multi-colored) and the other half were thin sock liners.<br /><br />None of the items went to waste, and the homeless community certainly appreciated them, but socks would obviously have been more useful to them than liners."
3.0,these are nice pants but the main problem is the draw string is far to short.
3.0,"Ordered up to a size 7, fits to the toe. No space in the front. Lights work well, loses charge if left on for a day.  One of the connectors got lost in the hole of the shoe, took a while to get it out."
3.0,This seems to be well made but it was too dull to work. I tried to sharpen the blade but I think my son may be able to sharpen it enough to work for me. I couldn't do it. It may be a good tool worth 5 stars after it is sharp.
3.0,tags tore off like they came from a store.. thought they would look better like pictured
3.0,A lot more transparent of what picture shows. Very pretty still
3.0,Purchase this for my wife. Good quality. Only thing she complained about was that it was a little difficult to open. And not too much room inside for much.
3.0,"Le doy 3 estrellas solo porque me quedó grande. La correa es de muy buena calidad, está muy bonita."
3.0,bracelet. kind of big for my taste.
3.0,"Its way too small, like the largest size i ordered says it is a 4x and its really a US size 10 or 12. The colors are great and how it is made is also great but unfortunately i can't fit it."
3.0,"Looks great, but the back was a little sharp and irritated my skin."
3.0,Received wrong color shirt.  Shirt is see through.
3.0,"Glass came out of the frame and had to force it into position. A little too big for my 2yo but strap does his job as the frame is rigid. Other than that, look and feels good quality. Will update once I test if a bit and find something. Specially about the UV protection and polarization"
3.0,"I do like these, but wish there was more of a color variety. I didn't realize they would be two packs of 10 in 2 color palettes (I got pink and more of a teal). I'm not too much of a pink person, and was hoping for more of a variety, especially some purple ones! They are soft, fit great and really pretty, just wish for more variety."
3.0,bow feel off first day she wore it.
3.0,a decent belt but will work ok will a IWB holster but just not stiff enough for much else.
3.0,If you have a larger neck and face this is not the best product for you. My face is wide and that made it fit a bit snug and the ear loops uncomfortable. Tight to the point of me putting it on and taking it off I actually pulled the thread apart and had to sew it back together.  It’s a nice product just not made for us in the big and tall world.
3.0,A little too delicate  Still a nice piece for the price
3.0,Not my size.
3.0,Really cute looking but way to short for my torso
3.0,"It’s a cute design, but the padding is very thick which I don’t like.  The padding is removable but I prefer a sports bra to have a light/thin padding versus no padding at all."
3.0,looks good just too small
3.0,"Cute shirt, fits like a muscle tee. I washed inside out before wearing, did not dry, and the design was stuck to itself! I may have used warm water so be sure to use cold, maybe that will prevent sticking."
3.0,I ordered black in small/med (5’4” 125) they fit great. Super cozy pants that keep me warm in our walks 40-50 degree weather. I wish I could wear everyday. However after one wash there is piling around the waist and butt. It’s not noticeable but it’s annoying to me. I’m hesitant to buy another just for them to do the same thing. It also seems like the thickness is wearing down after wash #4.
3.0,"Well, it finally arrived via a slow boat from China.  We will see how it holds up and if it matches the time it took to get here, it will be an accomplishment in itself.  The cost was reasonable so I am out a lot if it goes south.  Worth a try but did not like how long it took to get here."
3.0,Great leo loved the pattern.  Runs small.  Normal size is 12-14 and the 14-16 was small and too tight.
3.0,"Pockets are not as large as expected, cell phone keeps dropping out. Like the fabric."
3.0,"Took these with me to Disneyland. Both my daughter and I used them for the rides. I have prescription sunglasses and did not wish to lose them. They worked great! the only problem I had was when entering a shops or dark rides, i had to remove my sunglasses, which was not easy when these guys work so well. Hair pulling and difficulty removing, but they hold your glasses on. I can see these would be excellent for sports!"
3.0,Pro love the color .cons pants are short .very thin material but will be nice in the spring
3.0,"I bought these masks for my 5 and 7 yo (both of whom are small for their ages) and these run pretty small. If they use the ear loops, it pulls their ears forward and if they don't use the ear loops then the mask falls down."
3.0,I cannot adequately review it as it did not fit my FitBit.
3.0,"A little more casual than I I thought, but great weekend and casual wear"
3.0,"I really liked the quality of this night gown. However, I am only 4:11ft tall and it fits me mid leg. In the picture it shows at ankle length. Thanks. Elodia"
3.0,"Very cute dress, but very small on top.  The bottom was fine."
3.0,I could still hear my husband snoring
3.0,Torso was too short even though I am fairly short so I returned with no issues.
3.0,"Love dress, lots of compliments BUT if you sit to long, it makes white marks as in a wrinkly look. I will order a second one."
3.0,"these jeans are lined and fit surprisingly well considering its just by waist size no inseam required. size 34w = 32 length<br />cheaply made but for a $30 jean what i expected.  zipper is kinda short and doesn't function well. button is also very tight thru button hole. First time wearing for a bit to check fit and style, I felt a burning sensation on my legs and took off to wash a couple of times before wearing again (seems to have solved the chemical burn sensation).<br />Also, several seams are just stitched once wear as name brand jeans generally have two rows of stitching. Lastly one of the front pocket developed a hole almost immediately. stitching was missing and was easy enough to fix, but poor quality there."
3.0,This sweater just didn’t hold up it’s bottom rib . It became very loose and the sweater keep falling down like it just hang on me. Product not so good will not buy this again.
3.0,Love the shirt but not as long as it looks.
3.0,"It was super cute, but the zipper was messed up and would not zip more than halfway up."
3.0,I like the sleeves but they fall down and I did not expect that.
3.0,"Both were too small, I’m sending them back for a refund."
3.0,"Nice purse.  Good color.  Roomy enough.  I returned it only because the tassels and attachment were too heavy for me.  (I need a lighter weight purse.)  Otherwise, it is a good buy."
3.0,I ordered size 6 for my 5yr old and it came as a size xs for teens.  It fit me other than the sleeve being too short.  Its very long for my 5yr old at the time.  This is such a weird sizing.  Really wished it fit cuz quality was good.  Sizing was just very off.
3.0,Fit fine and adheres great but the material used on the bra itself was rather cheap. Feels like a sponge and not really any fabric to it. Does the job. Ice uses it 3-4 times and still works just fine.
3.0,"It is nice, but strap is way too long"
3.0,"I don't like the way they fit my daughter. They're a bit small. She's a size 11 and I ordered the 11/12, yet her feet barely fit in them."
3.0,Style was very cute & can easily be dressed up or casual. I’m only 5foot 3inch therefore length was longer on me than pictured.<br /><br />Fabric was thin but basically what I’d expect for the price. I loved the dress EXCEPT beware the blue dye of the dress rubs off! I wore to a wedding and by dinner time my pale pink fingernail polish and hands were blue. NOT COOL because then I was worried I’d rub the color onto others.
3.0,I I've bought this from the Shein website and trust and believe me when I say that once you give it two washes the color bleeds and it becomes really washed out
3.0,Boxy cut. Not flattering. Returned it.<br />Wish they still made the city coat. Quality has gone down since the firm was acquired.
3.0,"Decent quality.  “Breathing area” is a little thicker and double layered even without filter, a + for wearing during COVID exercise.  Only major complaint is the earholes are very uncomfortable.  They should have added a little extra stitching or fabric at the top of the ear."
3.0,Ir look really good but cannot open it to put it on<br />Again missed return date cancer
3.0,"I'm 5' and the length would be great with heels.  The zipper, however, is very shotty.  I'm worried if we pull it up that it will be stuck or break."
3.0,Good design but the quality of the tee shirt could be better. One of those old gilden 100% heavy cotton. One wash and it’s a wrap. For the price you’d think you’d get at least an American apparel quality type tee.
3.0,Very hard to keep on your shoulder
3.0,"Cute, not great quality"
3.0,These would not fit into the piercing on my DIL ears so have no idea if they work on older piercings or not.
3.0,I didn’t like the material of the dress
3.0,The wallet's sleek appearance was destroyed by placing items in it. It was too bulky even with minimal items inside. The return was simple which is why I gave it 3 stars.
3.0,"Because I intend to loose weight, I have kept it."
3.0,"These are very small, if you have normal size hands for a woman they will be very tight. I suspect they won't make it for more than 1 season."
3.0,"Had my mountain bike fixed and want to start riding. Purchased a few accessories to include these eye-ware sun glasses. Selected them because of the not to flashy look and specs. At the time it was not PRIME - Ordered May 12, 2015 - Arriving Mon, Jun 8 - Wed, Jun 24 and actual arrival was May 23. Package arrived early and in good condition.  Eye-ware looked as described, however they feel flimsy, guess that is the light weight part.  Attached the cord and one of the ends pulled out of the loop.  It was easy to snap back the cord, but worries me that this may happen again while riding or playing another sport.<br /><br />Other then testing, have not put these to use.  Hopefully they will last.  I would not buy again."
3.0,"Eh, is not bad, but its not good. The hat itself isn't like any hat I've owned before it feels like something in the dimensions is slightly off. Not bad enough to make it uncomfortable but noticeable."
3.0,It's a 13 but more like a 12
3.0,"I am 5 foot 3, 116 pounds and I got the small. It fits like a glove, very naked and unforgiving but that’s what I expected. The dress is beautiful but the fabric is very weird, shiny and cheap,  I really wish this dress was in cotton. Not sure if I will keep it ."
3.0,"If you want these to fit the way that they show, then you definitely need to order a smaller size. The sizes that they say are definitely much larger than they say, and not all of them are the same sizes that they say. I ordered larger like they said to and two pairs were the same size, but extremely large and the other was about the size that it was supposed to be, though a little large. They are a comfortable material. They are definitely a loose fitting yoga pant through the entire leg."
3.0,"For a cheap price, they r very good. They will break over time. I got many compliments on them. Will be ordering again."
3.0,Low quality would not buy again
3.0,"Gem fell out in 24 hours. Still giving theee stars because it’s pretty, the clasp is fine, and superglue fixed the problem so it wasn’t an expensive fix."
3.0,"Great shirt. Very soft. But it is definitely not a slim fit. I have a bunch of harley apparel. An sometimes there slim fit, are not slim fit. Definitely order your normal size. Normally when it is a slim fit. I have to do a 2xl instead of xl.  But I have had another shirt and a long sleeve plaid that where huge for 2xl slim fit. An some 2xl slim fits I get fit perfect. I even got a rusty butcher that was xl normal and it was super tight before washing. So harleys size chart seems to be all over the place. Still a nice shirt and would recommend getting one. Just get your normal size and it will fit perfect. An the 50% polyester means it will barley shrink if any."
3.0,"Cheap looking, very thin"
3.0,runs a full size too small- I only buy the same size shoe in all brands- but NOT for this shoe- must be made in China- way too small
3.0,Got a lot of funny compliments . They are a bit see through
3.0,I liked the cut in the front and the straps. The design was good as I usually wear a similar product for working around the house or traveling long distances as a light support for my middle and lower back. The sizing was way off. I would need one 2 sizes larger which would take the shoulder straps too far out and off my shoulders.
3.0,"Like others reviews said, it does run small. I typically wear a medium and ordered a large. The sleeves are a bit too long, I'm 5 feet tall but the shoulder width is a little snug. I was able to layer a thin sweater under it, but could definitely feel the tightness. Super cute jacket that I'm sure I'll wear a ton over tees."
3.0,Wish the sleeves were a little more lose or stretchy. a bit tight in the arms for us big girls. but for all you lovely ladies im sure you'll love it
3.0,It's Alrite should've had a Larger Zipper...
3.0,"A primera vista se ve un buen reloj, pero no se le siente ni se le ve la misma calidad de mi otro Victorinox, la correa del Reloj no se ve original y al compararla con la correa de mi otro Victorinox se ve como una copia barata y de mala calidad, espero que esté solo sea el único problema a tener con este Reloj, espero poderle dar otra estrella más adelante cuando pruebe de verdad este reloj, por el momento me siento un poco decepcionado de esta pieza, espero cambiar de opinión en los próximos días y no tener que devolverlo.<br />Y otra cosa, el reloj llegó sin su respectivo manual y un papel doblado haciendo referencia al INOX, un reloj bastante distinto al que llegó en la caja, espero que la calidad del reloj me hagan olvidar en un futuro de todos estos inconvenientes a la hora de recibir esta pieza"
3.0,These are weird fitting. The length is very short so they look more like capris and the waist fits fine
3.0,"I'm really torn with this product. First- It is NOT SILK, so the title is false advertising.  It is polyester and only one side feels smooth to the touch. Second- the care instructions indicates the ""Do not wash"" symbol- not sure how you can never wash something you wear. The colors and quality are great for polyester."
3.0,was nice but larger than i expected
3.0,"I bought these under the assumption that they were cuff earrings.When I got them,  they were actually for pierced ears and I had to return them."
3.0,this is the power balance it ok but if your getting a medium get a large it will give more room unlike mine i have to pull very hard
3.0,"It's a beautiful piece, was just what I was looking for - but the tips of the wings are actually so sharp/pointed that I sliced my finger open."
3.0,Material is too thin but it will serve its purpose as a coverup.
3.0,"I don't like wearing dresses at all, but this style is so comfortable that I ordered a second one! will pill after a few washes."
3.0,"Small for a bracelet watch, though it does have two snaps for adjustment. The small size is snug on my small wrist and the larger one barely slides down my wrist. The watch does keep time which is what I want. The whole thing is cute and very affordable for an attractive &#34;sometimes&#34; watch to wear when I don't want to drag out my phone to see the time. For those sensitive to odors, the red leather has a perfume-y scent to it that may be objectionable until it wears off."
3.0,nothing special. You get what you pay for. serves its purpose
3.0,"I loved how it came on time and how it really looks on my husbands wrist because he is in Law Enforcement, but I had to give it three stars because after a while of wearing the bracelet the metal will turn your wrist blue and that is not something that you want your love one wearing or seeing in that matter. It is a great idea but they should come up with a clap that doesn't turn with sweat or water. Other than that it would a great product for the price."
3.0,"Adorable, buy apparantly the ring is very weak. I gave it to my dad as a gift and he lost one of the pieces because the ring pulled open. Super cute, but you may need to use another ring use it with your keys."
3.0,Be careful because they are very fragile. A plastic fishing line holds it together. It is attractive on but can be easily broken if not handled carefully.
3.0,I disked no inside pocket & the pockets are too shallow.
3.0,I love the way they look but they are a little right on my ears and are not adjustable.  They can only be worn for short periods of time.
3.0,I’m a 38c and the top of the shirt is so tight!!!!
3.0,I was the darker ones in the washer. And they shrunk. So they do need to hand washed.
3.0,"functional, as advertised"
3.0,"Meh, It's ok not great.."
3.0,The skirt was very pretty but I could not get it over my butt. It is not stretchy at all so if you’re curved I’d go a size up! I went a size up and it was still small!
3.0,Prehnite stone is beautiful but cheap wrap around was no good for stone's energy.
3.0,"They are beautiful and great quality, but they are quite long. I went and listened to the reviews and got 12 months instead of 18 which I usually would do so my 1 year old grows into them slower, and the 12 months fit very long on her (she's 13 months) my daughter is on the short side but they look long enough to fit on a 24 month baby. I would recommend 9 months for a 12 month old. 12 months for a 18 month old and so on...."
3.0,They're great. I only wish they were a little bit bigger and square bottomed.
3.0,"It got these as a gift, and they are curious socks, being thin and stretchy, with pretty minimalist non skid, all of which is underfoot - nothing on the ball or heel.  My guess is they would be good for something like yoga, where you might want the heel or toe to be able to slide."
3.0,Waist band does not have strong enough elastic - they slide down constantly - very uncomfortable
3.0,Fits large but seem to be good quality
3.0,"It does a really good job of blocking the brightness of the sun. It's affordable and comes in a pouch to store it. However, when I took the sunglasses off, my eyes felt a bit blurry."
3.0,The size was right on! However the fabric quality is marginal and the inseam is tight when trying to lift your leg. The draw strings are pointless and I just removed them but the elastic is plenty strong enough. For the price I would say they are a bit high based on quality.
3.0,"I love the graphic on this shirt, but once I washed it, it really shrank up. If available (it wasn't for me---I'm a plus-sized woman, so I ordered the 3X, which was the largest size available when I ordered), order a size up."
3.0,"This band does not look like the picture at all. It’s not actually a “silver” color. It’s just white with some shiny thread/stripes on it. The quality is decent and it fits the watch well, but it is not what I expected at all."
3.0,These fit fine but are not as comfortable as I would like.  The sand is also hot and the black neoprene seems to absorbe the heat so not sure if it’s real hot it they will protect from the heat
3.0,"Looks really good but it's way too small. I wear L and even though I ordered XL because these chinisium special brands of clothing always are too small, It did not fit my arms. It's good for warm weather because it is cotton. I gave it to my wife."
3.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a cousin that loves purses, but of course I inspected it on arrival. I was hoping for better, and I really hope it doesn't fall apart or break on her. It's a little dingy. The straps are flimsy, the zippers are cheap. The pockets are nice, though, and the canvas seems to be pretty good. It's a good sized bag. It is more green than in the picture, was hoping for that brownish green as in the pic.<br />As long as it doesn't break on her for a while then I guess it will have been worth it, if she likes it.  Fingers crossed."
3.0,"I ordered a small.  it was a little loose around the waist area, but overall I love it! Looks exactly like the pic!"
3.0,Size and Quality would have changed my thoughts on this purchase as it felt cheep and not worth the cost. Came a little big for my son and was not comfy though it my just be his skin.
3.0,Looks nice and made well. Not as much protection for the phone as I expected. Looking to get a new one.
3.0,"I wanted so badly to love this dress.  The problem I have is that I am a 34 DD, so even the large was too small across my chest.  I understand the description says &#34;Juniors&#34; so I should have known better.<br /><br />The print is adorable, but the garment is made in China and there is no lining, so the material is very see-through.  It is definitely worth a shot if you don't have huge boobs, but I would be prepared to wear it with a skirt slip or even sew in your own lining."
3.0,I ordered what was listed as size 4-8 for my very petite 8 year old. She comfortably wears size 6/7 in most brand. The shorts the came were size 5T and way too small.<br /><br />I then compared sizing to the Adidas website and they do have a size 5t in the toddler section and and an XS size 6/7 in the youth section. There is no size 4-8 listed anywhere on the Adidas website.
3.0,"Great color but the fabric is too thin.  The pockets show thru and bulge out (made me look like I had angular hips).  Removed pockets, closed seam, and dress was fine."
3.0,"Nice jacket for the price, easy to maintain. Just a tad large. Get if u you have the time to get it tailored for a better fist"
3.0,"The emblem was not as pictured, the seams were frazzled needed trimming...."
3.0,Material is great but the sizing is super off.
3.0,I like how long the sleeves are. I did take the strings out because they are unnecessary and bulky. I love the lace. It's super comfy and soft too. It did have a smell but itll go away after a wash. I got a large. I'm 160 lbs and have 38Ds.
3.0,Too bulky - glasses fit in it well but it just takes up too much room in my purse.  I would definitely look for something a little more slim.
3.0,Runs small so order at least one size up. Large fits like a medium but I love the feel of this material. Rcd partial refund so I'll keep it.
3.0,They were cute but much too large even though I ordered the size my daughter wears in other brands.
3.0,"I wanted to love this! The dress just wasn't well made, the skirt was separating as soon as I tried it on. Then, the little straps that went across the chest and the two that go down the skirt just kept coming undone. Just frustrating and low quality for the price. I know this is true with most costumes, but I had more issues with this than any other costume I have purchase in years past."
3.0,"Two of them got torn with my first wear. I'm afraid to put on the others. But I'd recommend another brand if you're looking for quality leggings. However, they are very comfy and fit well (I'm 5'10 & 150 lbs). Also, the maroon-ish pair of leggings look more red in reality than in the picture.. They're not that dark. And the brown is actually darker than in the picture. Not a deal breaker for me, but it might help someone."
3.0,"Beautiful, light-weight garment perfect for spring and summer, but runs way smaller than expected."
3.0,Lovely bag and insert too. Horrible smell not sure whether the dye or what....had to air for about a week before I could use the same.
3.0,"We read the reviews and most read “runs small”. We have a baby that wears a 2t, so we ordered a 4t. Way too small. Beautiful bright colors, just way too small."
3.0,I would give these 5 stars but I only received 2  pairs not 3. They are pretty cool though.
3.0,Pants are weird but the shirt fit my son great!
3.0,it is a great shirt. good quality but too small
3.0,"I ordered a pink pair of boots and received navy which isn’t even an option?? They run waaaay big. I do find them cute though. We wore them once even though they fit at least 2-3 sizes too big, but we had a winter snow coming in and needed something the next day.  they seem to be of pretty good quality."
3.0,"This is beautiful. It was too short for my tragus piercing. It did not go all the way though. I got one for my sister's tragus piercing too. She had the exact same issue. The post was not long enough to get through to screw the ball on. We were pretty disappointed. I guess we will have to get another piercing to use them on. In the meantime, I'll admire it's beauty in my jewellery box."
3.0,Size looks to be to small
3.0,"I normally wear an XL in sports bras and this one felt a little tight. I'm a 38B so I was surprised the bra felt snug.  The color is great and the compression is just right for when I am running.  I feel like the seams of the bra cups are unsightly but this is fine during exercise.  If you are looking for a sports bra to wear as a more casual, daily bra then you might want to skip this one as it doesn't provide a smooth look."
3.0,Pretty color but not compatible with high impact cardio
3.0,"Band fits my small wrist well, the watch itself was okay nothing to brag about.  Not bad for the price"
3.0,Way too long for short people! Comfortable otherwise.
3.0,Sizes should be added.  They are bigger than I like.  At least two sizes would be helpful.
3.0,"Very cute. But the bar is a bit long, may need some pliers to bend it a bit so it doesn’t poke your nose"
3.0,The size ran too small I had to return it .
3.0,"The only thing I didn't like is that the pants are low rise. They don't come up high enough on my hips for my liking. Nice color, legs fit well."
3.0,The fabric looks nicer in the pictures. Runs slightly small so if you are in the middle of a size.. size up.
3.0,"This set is very large for a 2 month old, hence I returned and bought a pumpkin hat from a seller on Etsy."
3.0,Cardigan is not true to stated size. Select two sizes larger when ordering this product.
3.0,The 2 pieces without clips are not useful and the yellow one is to much for my taste.
3.0,I bought a large because other reviews said it was big. It was very large.  I wear a 16 and had to take it in about 2 inches on each side seam. After I fixed it I absolutely love it.
3.0,"The band is nice, but the tool used to remove the links is useless. It broke and now I can't make the band smaller."
3.0,It was just too large
3.0,"Super cute bag, I was excited to start using it and have gotten tons of compliments. The outside is durable but within two weeks the lining on the inside has started ripping which hasn't affected anything but it was kind of disappointing. It's a lot smaller than it looks, and doesn't really have a lot of space with the middle pocket."
3.0,I had to have the dress altered. I ordered a large and I am a size 12. it was entirely too small. After I had it altered though it was just super! The material is light and airy. It's very comfortable and I have gotten several compliments on the dress.
3.0,Pretty but if you have petite hands the stones can rub against the fingers bordering the ring.
3.0,Dress size 16. Ordered XXL.  Fits too small.  Sleeves are uncomfortable
3.0,"I bought this thick cotton knit dress to wear as a nightgown and it's perfect for that. It's SO HARD to find 100% cotton ANYTHING. I wish this came in more colors and XLarge, so it could be worn as a dress. I wear a sz 10 dress, and while this is great for sleeping/lounging in, I would want a size larger to be able to layer and wear as a dress."
3.0,"Way to big! This should be a men's size. Not for women. I usually ware 4US shirt size, and despite this shirt I ordered an XS, it is still to big for me (5'4 ft tall, 104lbs)"
3.0,"Generally ok.  It can hold 4 passports max on the right side. But pockets there is loose, so you can't be completely sure about keeping them secured. Otherwise, no problem."
3.0,"I like that it’s just warm enough to get the chill out, but it’s a little too short, and whatever I put in the pockets falls out, except for keys. I’d love it it was just a bit longer, and the pockets a little deeper. I lost my charger cause it fell out of my pocket.☹️"
3.0,Much smaller than expected. I'll have to get a different one. 😡
3.0,"There not for men , they're pink."
3.0,It was a gift to my daughter but the clasp was broken so she had to fix it before it could be worn.  She said it was pretty.
3.0,"Bought this for work but it’s WAY too short, especially for someone plus size. It doesn’t hang the same on a big body versus a skinny one and they seem forgotten that on this dress."
3.0,"I really do love the look and feel fir thid watch, but it seems It has stopped working on me. I checked the winding stem and everything. Overall when it worked it was good, but it seems I may have messed something up so be carefull."
3.0,"didnt like its real color , it is shiny."
3.0,i love it but zipper is weak.
3.0,Nice shirt when arrived. Washed in cold water and the white in the shirt turned dingy cream color....so not happy!!
3.0,"I'm 123lbs, 5'01. Normally a size M so after reading the reviews I order a L. The top is a lit.small and the bottom are a lit.big but they don't really cover much of the butt (I guess u must have a flat butt). Still I'm ok with it."
3.0,Too stretchy and zero support. I gave it to my mother in law as we wear the same size and she loved it. If you like structure or support this is not your bra. If you hate underwire or any tightness this would work well for you.
3.0,i returned
3.0,"We like these neck gaitors, but in this set of 2, 1 of them the cinch mechanism wasn't working properly."
3.0,They are helpful in keeping the glasses in place but they are so short the users head Size has to be very small
3.0,"Super loose around the neck and hikes up in the back. I had to purchase and wear a ski mask with an open face to wear under it with my costume. It’s snug to the face but super loose at the neck and does not look flattering. However, it was only 20 dollars so I can’t be too mad. It gets the job done for a cheap price, but if you have a smaller head I do not recommend this product."
3.0,Looks like the picture however the measurements must be way off. Some discrepancy expected but this swimsuit has they length appropriate for a child. This is definitely not for y'all girls. While the size around fit the torso was so short to top of the swim suit barely made it to the top of my chest. Best for those with a short torso. Must have received a defected one. I'm 5'8 and 183 shorter and smaller than the first reviewer and while the suit came up and the width is ok the amount of fabric for the torso seemed to be like 3 inches.
3.0,Lenses will eventually pop out of frame.
3.0,"Does not fit my wrist right. Remove links, but in between a link. Remove one more it to small keep it in way to big."
3.0,The dress looked great however we ordered a small and received a large.  My daughter was upset but I have a very adorable new dress!
3.0,is a little large
3.0,The airline company broke a wheel in the first trip. I guess it is not very resistant.
3.0,"Much too large and gaudy looking. The picture portrayed it much smaller and daintier. If it was half the size, I’d be thrilled with it. As is, I’ll be returning. Do NOT purchase unless you prefer in your face costume jewelry."
3.0,The green color was very brown toned. Not a good color. I returned it.
3.0,They look like playboy bunnies in person …. And the screw back came undone within 2 days
3.0,"Top half fits good, bottom half is very tight , maybe go a size up"
3.0,Just doesn't fit well. Would like to return it.<br />Thank you
3.0,Bout this thinking it was thicker like a sweatshirt but instead it’s a lightweight cotton long sleeve. Still comfortable but was hoping for it to be thicker like the pictures indicate
3.0,did not look like a $100.00 bag
3.0,Color and feel is nice but the fit was tight
3.0,"I wasn't expecting much for the cost, but these fall apart after their first few washings. I wouldn't recommend them for wearing on your head."
3.0,"Pretty, but overpriced."
3.0,The wife washes all garments before she wears them and they looked like they lost some of their satin shine after the first wash.
3.0,I purchased these for my dad who is an older gentleman to help reduce glare at night when he's driving. I decided on these because of the price point was only $3. They are a Chinese knockoff fudge seemed to work well for him from what he tells me
3.0,"Mareine Photochromic Blue Blocking Glasses are not 100% protective as advertised. I tried them on and used the small blue light and it bothered my eyes.  The glasses are not 100% functionally, but still very convenient because its better than a naked eye to protect and because you can still use them in a fashion way and or to just physically protect your eyes since they are clear transparent with no vision enhance. Plus, it has a beautiful stylish frame model."
3.0,The look good and the color is great - get lots of comments - but they become uncomfortable around the ears after just a couple of hours.  Good for short periods of time though and they do block the sun.
3.0,"This dress is cute and lightweight.  It fits nicely and will work for most casual settings.  The fabric could be of a little better quality, but overall it is worth the purchase."
3.0,"I can not use it because it is smaller than they said. But it seems nice, so I expect I can use it in the future."
3.0,"When we received it, my girlfriend warned me that it was likely to get lost, and it did - on the very first day.  The clasp is not a locking type.  It is an open hook which slides into a loop.  It seemed somewhat secure, but an afternoon of walking was all it took to make it fall off (somewhere).  It's too bad.  The three layers created a beautiful effect.  I would order it again, if I thought there was a better way to keep it attached.  If you can be more careful than we were, get it!"
3.0,"The socks we absolutely adorable . However , the size chart was a little off.  I am 5&#34;3 with a size 8 shoe . This put me at a size medium , which were more like high thighs on me with my height ."
3.0,"little less detailed than picture, but it's pretty cool still."
3.0,It was thin and quality was not good.
3.0,I didn’t like how I had to wear a under shirt with the pumpkin shirt. You could feel the patch where it was ironed on. And it was awful. Made me itch the whole time wearing it.
3.0,"I re-ordered the same socks I've been buying and wearing for years but the ones I got were different from those old ones.<br />The socks I got in this order were marked ""New Improved Design."" They are not as comfortable or as high quality as the ""old"" design.  Although these are not quite tube socks they are now pretty close to being tube socks with very little shape to the heel area.<br />In the past the extra large fit pretty well after a couple of washings. In this order they are running larger.<br />I'll be looking for something better for my next purchase.<br /><br />I tried the Wigwam ""Volley"" crew socks and they were pretty close to the old style ""Super 60."" Of course they cost more but what doesn't these days? I'll be getting a few more pairs of the Volley style."
3.0,"These pants are adorable and they are very flattering. HOWEVER, the pants smell like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The musty, mildewy scent is unbearable. I tried washing them in hot water with tons of detergent and fabric softener, but the smell persists. I’m hoping it was a rare occurrence, as I want to order a pair, but for now I’m tossing these."
3.0,"I purchased the XL, and I typically wear an 18 ladies or a 16W womens.  It fits fairly loose in the chest (I am 40DD) and then it is tent city after that.  Even being loose, you can see the color of your undergarment beneath it (I purchased the purple).  Still, it was a $10 dress.  It does have nice swing, with a little weight to the bottom, and is a nice deep color.  If I had paid more, I'd be returning it, but $10, I'll keep it and make it a beach dress."
3.0,"Product great but too expensive, as was the shipping for something weighs very little."
3.0,"There's no blue stone on the bracelet, the stone on the necklace is white and is very short. Does not come as shown, its kinda difficult to open and the bracelet is very sparkly looks kinda feminine."
3.0,Fabric is cheep and losses shape
3.0,"I loved this product, I bought it for me and my bf but his got caught on a blanket and the chain snapped, so I’m not sure how strong the chain is."
3.0,The shoes is excellent except the part that goes across the top of your foot and you can’t really size up
3.0,Colors don’t match what’s pictured in the description.
3.0,It's nice but too small
3.0,I got an XL which is my usual size and the sleeves were to long and shoulders to wide. Quality of the sweater appears to be good. Nice and heavy for warmth but I would order a size smaller than usual size.
3.0,"This dress is not what I was actually expecting looks more like a nurse uniform then a dress,it is too thick and loose and boxy, the size is right."
3.0,"I did'nt like the size of the product. It is very small, the picture shows a much larger earring. The quality is pretty good sterling silver."
3.0,"I bought two of these in different colors and mostly they are beautiful and just what I wanted.  However, there are slits in the sleeve portion and I don't know what they are for.  If I put my arms through them, it looks silly.  If I don't, it looks like I'm wearing it wrong.  I just wear it anyway, but it is kind of weird."
3.0,very small - did not return but will likely give away
3.0,Skin color is a deep dark pink not even close to flesh tone looks like a clown face
3.0,Too big for myself
3.0,"I got this bracelet, and the matching choker, for my wife as a gift. I thought it would be a nice addition to her Ren. Faire costume. I was kind of right...<br /><br />The jewelry looks great. And it looked fantastic on my wife. The lace is a nice construction, which still looks delicate and pretty. The metal work and the chains look nice as well, although they feel a little &#34;cheap&#34;. Although, for the price, there's only so much you can really expect.<br /><br />The problem we had was, the minute my wife put on the bracelet and ring, the stone on the ring fell off. I mean, it was immediate. Now, it could probably have been fixed with a little superglue and about 30 seconds, but unfortunately for us, the stone took a funny bounce, and completely vanished. I was wildly disappointed that happened. Again, it probably would have been an easy fix, but it didn't happen. As a result, it has never gotten worn. Oh well..."
3.0,"This looks very pretty, but it not practical. In order to get the stud on the outside of your nose, the open area is on the outside where nothing holds it in place. It slips alot, and needs to be readjusted. Sometimes I have to be sure it hasn't fallen out."
3.0,I purchased this product for my baby shower..item was good no damages. But too hard to Ware and the earrings are very big in size. This product is good for who likes the heavy jewelry.
3.0,A bit snug from tip to toe<br />The lace peeking out of the shoe is adorable
3.0,"It'll work fine if you need it, but I have a Black $20 raincoat that I got from Costco a few years ago which is way way better quality, and doesn't feel or sound like a plastic bag.<br /><br />I got this cause bus drivers where I live currently keep almost missing me, or missing me, despite the fact that I'm waiting at a well lit bus stop, right past an intersection... 25 years of riding the bus and I had never been driven past till last thursday (but the drivers for this service 'nearly' miss me all the time, it's ridiculous). I even had my phones flashlight on to illuminate me further today, but the driver admitted he just wasn't paying attention.<br /><br />I'm hoping having a super viable jacket will help, so for it's utility I'm okay with the cost (beats last minute $15 taxi fares vs $2 bus fares). But otherwise I'm not very impressed with the jacket, and I hate cinched sleeve and waistlines, so I'll likely cut out the elastic.<br /><br />There's also other similar jackets on here for less $ that have more reflective material, more stylish trim, and adjustable hoods."
3.0,"I loved this watch when I saw it, although I've definitely decreased the amount that I've been wearing it. It's really durable, so I like that, it's just that the height is too tall for a watch. It'll get caught on my sleeves when trying to take a coat or shirt off. But I really do like that it's self-winding."
3.0,"it's just okay.  The elephant is one-sided and the attachment to the cord is just meh -- the elephant often doesn't lie flat, but sticks out.  Came with a cheapo silver anklet, too."
3.0,Too snug around the waist.
3.0,It's cute and small just material is really thin easy to Frey apart if too much in it
3.0,"I loved this shirt so I was quite disappointed when after a few months of wear and wash it developed holes. I had already bought another one and had the same thing happen, so it could have something to do with how soft this shirt is, or not drying it on low. I wish I could give more than three stars as I did really like this shirt while it lasted but I can’t with these holes. If you do buy this shirt, I might recommend hang drying it, or being very careful about what you dry this shirt with and being sure to dry on low and wash it on gentle."
3.0,"The good: The print and material on this product are adorable. It looks like the picture.  It came quickly and with no errors.<br />The bad: the product did not fit unfortunately.  The top portion is tight,  but fits for the most part.  However,  the bottoms are very much too small.  There is no wiggle room.  I could not swim comfortably in this suit.<br />For reference. I normally wear a medium.  I'm 5'3 and 130lbs. I bought the largest size available.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review."
3.0,The bathing suit is nice but it did not provide the needed support for my 36DD's - I had to return it.
3.0,The back sandal strap broke on the first day I wore these so sadly I'm returning the sandals. They are super cute and fit as expected but they were uncomfortable after a couple of hours.
3.0,"Product is nice, thin, and cool, but not UPF 50+as per the website description and the bag."
3.0,I bought a large. It was too small for me as well as my friends. Maybe by 2 sizes? Also doesn't work with C-sized boobs or bigger.
3.0,Listen!!! It's too small. Everyone is telling the truth. Kids 8yrs or older can not fit it.
3.0,"it look cheap to be honest. but  I mean, it is cheap. So, you get what you pay for!"
3.0,Too small for me. I gave them me my son and he said they are OK.
3.0,"The material reminded me of costume fabric, but it fit nicely and was comfortable nonetheless. I had to return it because I didn’t like the cut of the neckline on me."
3.0,"Love the style, fit, and comfort... but... This dress has a VERY strong chemical odor. I washed it twice and I can still smell it, so I'm not sure if I will be keeping this item. Unfortunate because it's super cute."
3.0,"I washed these pants once before wearing them around the house.  They are comfortable, but this morning, I noticed a piece of fabric, located in the waist area in the back of the pants, (originally tucked into the seams) had came out, so I now have a loose fabric about 2 inches apart from my pants.  The fabric size was cut exact to fit into the seams, so I wonder if the fabric was a bit too snug/small and stretched and pulled away from the seams after a few uses.  Overall, I still like the pants, hence the three stars, but now I will have to sew it back so it doesn't continue to rip a larger hole, and I am not good with needles, and I don't have burgundy thread. So I'll have to use this for home use from now on."
3.0,Good enough purchase but didn't fit as expected.
3.0,"Fits the iWatch perfectly and it's very sparkly, but it does feel rough and it does catch and pull on fabrics to the degree that I can't really wear it regularly.  Forget long sleeves when you're wearing this, it's hard to even raise your sleeve to check your watch!  I'd have sent it back if it didn't come from China, and while we're on that subject, it's way overpriced for being Chinese.<br />Do not recommend."
3.0,It’s a very pretty bracelet but I only got one UPDATE ON THE BRACELET MY BRACELET EXPLODED ALL OVER MY DRIVEWAY . What has happened to QUALITY????
3.0,Wasn't long after I'd received it the wiring was damaged... we fixed by wrapping in electrical tape after reconnecting..but still have to fool w/ it to light... More CHINESE quality merchandise...... Is there anything made in USA anymore????
3.0,"Beautiful stones. However, one of the strands came apart. Hopefully, it's an easy fix. I have a small wrist so the links moved a lot."
3.0,"I would reall love this, IF my boobs were smaller. I am a size 16 in pants  and a 38 DD. The top is heavily padded and just doesn't work out for me.  It is really great quality and would fit someone with a smaller chest very well. The bottoms fit great! I love the way that they hug my curves and are very comfortable.<br /><br />For the price you just can not beat the quality. It is very well made. I truly wish that I could pull it off! I like the bottoms so much in fact that I am going to keep them and find a top that matches. I would recommend this brand to friends for sure.<br /><br />I got this at a discounted rate for my honest opinion."
3.0,"Beautiful boot, but did not fit around my calves.  I had to get the boot altered to add red elastic in the back just so I could zip them up.  The did I g fit the shoe size perfectly, but the leg was narrow."
3.0,No quedan como las fajas normales
3.0,Squished my toes more than the shoes
3.0,It came undone from the chain easily but jewelry pliers fixed that and I didn't look closely at the pic when I decided to buy it didn't think or understand why there would be grey in the top half of the necklace it looks weird.
3.0,Kinda cute - kinda look like dime-store bargains. My hair gets caught in the gaps between the rings... so I can only wear them when my hair is pulled up.
3.0,Lindo pero grande. La cabeza viene con piel sintética que no se ajusta a la realidad del murciélago
3.0,"I like to work out and I like dryfit. These tanks are not like any other dryfit that I’ve purchased from name brands like lululemon and Nike. The tanks are single layer and they are absolutely see-through under direct light. That aside, they are comfortable and if you don’t mind the see thru aspect and the fact that they aren’t dryfit but rather non-absorption style fabric, go for it."
3.0,"The bracelet we received was much lighter in color compared to the bracelet shown on the website, so we returned it.It was pretty but too light in color."
3.0,Runs small. I ordered a size up and it was still too small. Sheds. I will say it felt really soft.
3.0,"These handkerchiefs are thinner than what I usually purchase, so they become more easily &#34;soaked&#34; than I'd like (Sorry, I couldn't think of a delicate way to put it).<br /><br />Also, the fabric feels quite rough on my nose after a few uses; part of the reason I prefer handkerchiefs to Kleenex is that well-made handkerchiefs last longer and still maintain a soft, cozy feel. These haven't quite hit that bar.<br /><br />They've been through the wash several times and have held up well; no noticeable signs of wear, and the stitching is holding firm. Great deal for the price!"
3.0,This fits weird. The opening comes up to the stomach area.
3.0,Flimsy. Won’t last
3.0,it was not off the shoulder
3.0,Much bigger than expected. Didn't see an option to purchase a smaller size; will give away. Comfy but too big.
3.0,"I liked these glasses while they lasted, which wasn't very long. They are polarized indeed, that was nice. I took them on vacation with me and after 2 weeks of using them at the beach and swimming, the parts that hold the sides must have rusted or something. I couldn't open the glasses with ease anymore and eventually one of the sides snapped and broke. I get it that these are cheap and I shouldn't expect much but I never had this problem with any of my sunglasses before, even cheap ones. This is a new level of poor quality."
3.0,"It's a great bag, but my handle was broken upon lifting my bag and I only had it a few moments."
3.0,"It was longer than I expected, is not as the picture looks"
3.0,Did not come as pictured. I received two sun earrings but didn't think it was worth the trouble to get one exchanged for the moon. It was worth the price I paid but I wouldn't pay any more for them.
3.0,"Look good, but sheds"
3.0,This ring was so cute at first but tarnishes kind of quickly and gives me an allergic reaction which is so weird since I’m not sensitive to fake metals or anything. You could probably find a better one for a similar price
3.0,Great until the bottom piece broke off.
3.0,I had to return these boots  sadly. They were to small/narrow. They were so difficult to get on and off. They are so cute just did not work for me.
3.0,I would rate this hat as only its ok….very lightweight but runs small….although it fit just not a comfortable fit…..but still it should fit most normal sized women's heads
3.0,Cute.  The bows fell off on both boots and had to superglue for quick fix
3.0,So I should have ordered a small the look is amazing but I wouldn't count on this to keep me warm at all it's so thin very stretchy material but again it's very very cute but it also took 3 more days than expected
3.0,The only thing I didn’t like is it seemed to get “dirty” looking real fast. And it wasn’t dirty. I washed it and it looked the same. It’s comfortable though.
3.0,when I first got this purse and opened it there was a small sachet in it It had no smell to it and I threw it away. The purse  had a strong smell of something unpleasant. I sprayed fabreeze on a cloth and put it in the purse renewing it a couple of times until the smell went away. the lining is not strong enough to hold my phone in place. I have a Samsung galaxy7. I  had to  change  my wallet to get it in and out  and it is better. The zipper needs to be a little longer. You have to fight to get things in and out. I  would  not buy again. I love the color. I really like the adjustable shoulder strap. I like the snap that holds the handles together. I will look for another purse that has a stiffer side.
3.0,"The graphic looks good, but the shirt is a bit stiff compared to some softer band shirts I own, and despite being listed as a women's shirt I feel it's a straight cut, not really meant for wider hips or a larger chest like I usually expect from a shirt specifically targeted towards women. Still a nice shirt for a great band!"
3.0,"I never opened the package, returned because it was after the date needed"
3.0,It's cute. Stones are larger than I had envisioned and I wish the chain was a little stronger. It was a gift and my friend did like it
3.0,"Very cute, but difficult to clasp. I have to get my son or husband to help."
3.0,Fabric is stiff and the size runs big
3.0,not as in pic - very mat!
3.0,It’s fits perfectly but not the best quality!
3.0,"Basically, I had to reorder twice because their sizing is off. Normally, I wear a 10, but their 10 was too big,so I returned and reordered a 9 1/2...still too large. Reordered again to get a 9 and, though it is OK, it is still a bit too long."
3.0,I really like the shirt though it's really not a slim fit - removing 2 stars<br />My boyfriend is 5'8'' 180lb wearing a large. The fit around the shoulders is just right and it's a little loose around the waist. The material is soft and hugs the body well without being clingy. The quality is much better than expected.<br />I love the red buttons and the blue/white/red detail around the sleeves and on the collar.
3.0,"I've worn it twice and it's already lost a stone.  A similar ring of similar price that I have had for four years (and which is sadly no longer available) has lost one stone just recently and I wore it virtually every single day of those four years.  So I'm kinda bummed to have already lost a stone, but it IS cute."
3.0,"They are ok.  Unfortunately, I selected the wrong strength  too strong  so can't wear them  very long"
3.0,A bit larger than I expected; it's okay though.
3.0,"See through alert! The white crochet top is in fact, see through. The bust and &#34;shorts&#34; actually fit fine, it was just made for someone much shorter than me. I had a super wedgie as soon as I put it on. It made a distinct line in all the wrong places. I'm 5&#34;7 and got a S. If i was 5'3 it probably wouldn't have been an issue."
3.0,I like that they fit. I took a chance and order them and I believe I will be okay with them when I wear them. Just don't like that bad smell
3.0,"I was not dazzled by this product, but after all, it was very cheap."
3.0,Nice hoodie. But was expecting a hoodie. This is more like a tight hoodie shirt.
3.0,"The beads feel cheap and Saturn is especially cheesy, which is sad because I loved Saturn in the photo."
3.0,"Ordered a large. Love the top - it fits 34B well. Description is &#34;push-up&#34;, which is not the case.  Material is very good, considering the price, but is different for the top and bottom. The top is fantastic and well made.  As shown in the photo, the bottom is cut like a Tanga/Cheeky - not much more coverage in the back.  I wear a 4/6, and a Large was snug .  Print on the bottom as shown in the photo."
3.0,Sizing was very small for an Men’s Large. Perfectly fits my 5”2 girlfriend however and she loves it so win win I guess?
3.0,Too small and kind of expensive
3.0,"Cute, overlay is itchy for me and very long even with wedge sandal.  Should have sized up to a large.  little tight in bust."
3.0,"Breathable, but I had a hard time keeping it above my nose. Need a smaller size for women"
3.0,The 3 star rating is because only after 3 days of my fiancé having this attached to her purse some of the stones/crystals dislodged and when that happens there’s a gaping hole which renders the item useless
3.0,"wayyyy to large, haven't been able to wear it yet."
3.0,This bodysuit ran large. After reading the reviews I thought I would be a M or L so I bought both but ended up needing a small. The fabric is light. Stitching incomplete so there was a hole at the butt. It’s a good alternative if in a bing but you get when you pay for.
3.0,Did not receive bracelet
3.0,Dress is made of really low quality material. The white part is almost see through and it’s fits weirdly. I wouldn’t recommend buying it. I won’t even wear it but forgot to return it. Feels more like something ordered from wish.
3.0,For surfing not that good -waves take it off relatively easily. But I use it as light head protection and keep warm in Pacific during winter.
3.0,Tight and small cut
3.0,"They’re not bad quality but they still slip super quickly, even when brand new"
3.0,"If you want something that will actually fit close to the skin on your face, this will not do it for you. I cannot see actually skiing with these as they are so loose, the eye hole moves around and can block vision. Works fine for my purposes until the temperature drops below 20 degrees Fahrenheit."
3.0,"Very low in front and wide shouldered opening. Cute, but not like picture."
3.0,"I love the bag, it holds a ton for being a carry on. Unfortunately I've only used this on about 4 trips and the wheels are already ruined and I'm not sure they can be replaced so the whole suit case may be ruined now."
3.0,"I love the fabric and it’s very pretty, how ever it’s way to big. I ordered a small, and it’s like I had ordered a large. There isn’t a tag in it so I can not tell what size it truly is."
3.0,These panties look just like pictured. (I should have looked a little closer!)  They are a high rise full brief panty. Low cut around the thighs. All polyester (which I didn’t like) and the crotch lining is only half the size of normal panty crotch liners and is not enough to cover the vagina area. I trashed the one I tried on and donated all the others.
3.0,Not has tight as I would have like.
3.0,"Fit okay, kind of small and it shrunk after I washed it the first time. Looks more like a shirt now."
3.0,"I ordered this in the blue and the dark tan. I’m thick so I order both in large. The tan one fit perfectly but the blue one was too small. I could barely get the top on at all. The top was more like a small and the bottoms fit like a medium.<br />But strange enough, the dark tan in large fit perfectly. For reference my measurements are:  34DD, 30 inch waist and 44inch hips. I typically wear large bottoms (size 8/10) and I’m usually a medium in tops."
3.0,Pounch too small for medium
3.0,Not happy with this. The writing is so small on the hat you can’t read it.
3.0,Cuffs too big.
3.0,Bought these for my elderly mom who has some swelling in her feet and found that the tops don't stretch very well and they seem to be somewhat shorter than the photo shows.. They are probably fine if you have small ankles but didn't work well for us.
3.0,Tight fitting but really great buy.
3.0,"The panties fit perfectly, but the bra was too small for me. I kind of figured it would be, but thems the breaks."
3.0,can't figure out how to work the stand..are they suppose to fix together??..if so don't get it!
3.0,"I got the largest size for my husband who wears a xl-2xl and this shirt didn't fit at all, at least he got a nice time out of it"
3.0,"I like how the jean fabric is not too thick, nor too thin, and the pockets and buttons are cute details.<br />The problem is the color fades too quickly only after a couple wears. When I fold and store it in the closet, it creates those weird faded lines that make the skirt unwearable. Maybe just hang it to save yourself from that problem."
3.0,I ordered this dress because for a costume that needed a green dress.  The dress that came is definitely an aqua blue and not a a shade that evenly remotely resembles green.  It is also on the small side.  I kept it as a beach cover up.
3.0,Returned because of sizing
3.0,Got item and it was obviously a returned item.  Pet hair ALL over it.  Good thing I'm not allergic.  Just very unprofessional.  Dress must have been mismarked as far as size.  Says its a large and it is obviously a medium.  I have ordered other colors of this same dress and the size has been true until this one.  My daughter liked it and it fits her so I will WASH it and keep it....this time.
3.0,"It is a nice dress and the color and fabric are great. I have larger chest and still got a larger size and it still didn't fit around the bust, honestly was already anticipating this happening but still tried anyway. Just returned the next day no problem."
3.0,"I LOVE this dress and style.  The size run:  BIG IN SIZE.<br /><br />Medium:  Feels like & looks like size 8-10.<br />I have to go HALF SIZE down, which they don't have.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: the material is of nice quality.<br /><br />***Dress is a full button down from collar to knees.  BUTTONS are SPACED TOO FAR APART causing gaps to see within."
3.0,"I wanted a triangular bag after missing out on the discontinued Evernote bag. This, however, is not all that great. It only hold its shape if it is full. If your EDC is light, then this will fall over incessantly. The outer pocket in the top flap needs some organization pockets. The padding on the strap is not moveable, but at least the strap is adjustable so you can position the padding correctly, eventually.<br /><br />I've kept using it thus far, but I am still wanting for something better."
3.0,we loved our matching jammies but ladies bottoms are too short and even though i hung to dry they still shrunk.<br />i would rather see sold separately as my husband's large top was too small but xtra large bottoms would have been huge
3.0,Made really cheap.
3.0,Ughh I bought a cpl of these bags; blue and yellow. I really liked them but unfortunately the zippers on both bags broke early on. The bags are roomy. Fit over shoulder comfortably. The blue is a dull faded denim color. The yellow is really bright. The material is durable. Really wish the zippers were of better quality.
3.0,I love the idea of it i love the light up i love the custom words u can put under the picture.. I do have an issue though its not sturdy it doesn't have a switch to turn on and off the lights because of that I lost my batterys in it at target and I didnt have the time to find it so I picked up my charm and got what I need and left im disappointed in that
3.0,"Made very well, but the style didn't suit me."
3.0,"I bought this a while back and have put it on my backpack. I love the way it looks and the quality of it, however, the backing keeps coming off and i'm honestly surprised I haven't lost it yet. I only wish the backing was more secure to the pin. Otherwise, the pin itself is nice."
3.0,"The quality was not bad, but a little bit tight under the arms for me which makes it not as comfortable as I expected."
3.0,"The tie itself is good quality and it was delivered the next day. However, the description of the tie is incorrect. It is gold with navy blue dots. I'm attaching a picture and put it next to something black so that you can compare. If you want to wear this tie with a black suit, do not order!!! It will look fine with a blue suit however."
3.0,The summer cap with this price is good .In my opinion the cover area should have been wider to look good after wearing.Anyways the cap fits well.The material is pure cotton which is great for summer.the color is solid n doesn't wash off.One should not expect more at this price.
3.0,"This sports bra is adorable -- has a great look/fit and the fabric is nice, but while the description reads as ""Medium Impact,"" a tag that was attached to the bra itself shows that the bra is ""Light Support."" I think this bra would be great for yoga or pilates, but I wore it to a cycling class (as mentioned in the listing) and wouldn't recommend it for that level of activity or beyond."
3.0,They are ok not really what I wanted.
3.0,This skirts fits nice but the fabric is like a  Picnic tablecloth very plastic
3.0,The necklaces came completely tangled. It took me an hour to take them apart. Super cute though.
3.0,"Can't prove that they are not cotton, but they do not feel like it.  Even after several washings they are scratchy.  All my other bandana's feel much softer.  Maybe they changed the fabric to accommodate the Covid19 needs for bandana's?  Which would be understandable, but then, please don't market them as 100 cotton.  Colors are beautiful. Size is true."
3.0,very very thin
3.0,I like how sturdy it is but too big for my liking.
3.0,Barely fits me. I have too wear something non sheer under them it’s short. It is really cute mine has a seen that looks too be not stitched at all.
3.0,"I thought this handbag would be bigger it was too small , but it’s pretty. Too small for me, though"
3.0,Dress came looking worn!
3.0,Cute dress but cut too small
3.0,"Dress is very pretty and attractive on. It would be a nice dress to wear to work, church, or an afternoon wedding. I wouldn’t describe it as a casual T-shirt dress and would feel too dressy if I wore it as a casual dress to  run errands in,, hang around the house in, wore it to a picnic or a romp in the park or anything that would be considered casual.<br /><br />Ore"
3.0,"As someone who owns a lot of scarves, I mainly want to point out to anyone on the hunt for a new one to add to their collection, that this is not an 'oversized' scarf. I don't know the size of the model in the images but to me, unless you are a size extra-extra small (which high-five if you are), the images are pretty misleading because the item itself is nowhere near that long or wide. However, aside from the sizing, the material is very nice and the colors are great. It has been through the wash a few times and has not faded nor does it have much pilling or fraying. As a 'larger' woman, I can easily wear it as a scarf or drape it over my shoulders it just isn't as big as I feel the images make it appear to be. But, overall, it is still a nice item that I continue to wear and get many compliments on."
3.0,"Been wearing this for a week straight since they came and yesterday, luckily, I noticed one was almost falling out and it was because the post was bent parallel with the earring.  It could have only happened when I was asleep.  So, I'm thinking the silver may be 925 but it is way too soft.  I anticipate losing one down the road so may see about returning them, or exchanging if that's possible."
3.0,"I like that this stretches a lot (I usually wear a 1x and it fit fine)  but I did not realize there was a pink ribbon hem around the whole bottom of the skirt with jewels on it, sort of like a belly dancer skirt, and I didn't really like it. I used it as a pool coverup skirt instead of wearing it out to dinner because I didn't really like the bottom. I think the bottom detracts from the cute, colorful pattern. I am also not sure if it is thick enough not to be see-through if used as a skirt."
3.0,"This belt (the reversible design) is described as top grain leather, but it looks like it is made of plastic. Perhaps this is a bug due to Amazon's lumping together of different products under the same listing. It looks cheap and I would have never bought it if I had seen it in person. Nonetheless, at least it was cheap and it's a belt, so I use it. I'd recommend spending a bit more, however, for a better product."
3.0,Returned next day.  Same size as my champion pants only 2 sizes smaller.  I was disappointed
3.0,"Fine if you're looking for lightweight leggings, I would not call them jeans. I returned them, not a fan. I never write reviews, but since I don't remember seeing anything about the fake front pockets, I wanted to give a heads up to future shoppers who might share my pet peeve.<br /><br />I sized up based on reviews. Don't know if that was necessary, since these are VERY stretchy... I could easily put them on and take them off without undoing them, but my normal size might have flattened things out in a weird way because of how stretched they would be.<br /><br />If you're a fan of denim leggings, you might really like these. I've noticed there seems to be no standard all brands use to decide what to call a skinny Jean and what to call a jegging. For example, my American Eagle high rise jeggings are thicker and much less stretchy (and lower rise than these, which are labeled midrise) than these &#34;jeans&#34; ... go figure. Plus, they have front pockets."
3.0,"So i got this and immediatly returned it. I got the us medium like i do for every other thing i buy on amazon. But this fit too small. The appearance of the jacket was a little less appealing then the pictures showed. It's not a bad product, nor would I detour someone from getting it. But make sure you choose a large if you wear a medium."
3.0,"Super thin. Amd if u have skin, try rubbing that on a microfiber towel... makes u feel like ur skin is dry af. This sweater is HELLA EFFING CUTE but the fabric catches on everything as fine as the texture of ur skin. But only on the outside. The inside is soft amd pleasant."
3.0,"cute, I'd suggest the high waisted 2 piece to hide belly fat :)"
3.0,Looks great but is made for child's arm not an adult.
3.0,"This is not off the shoulder unless you're kid sized.  I thought it would be baggy and loose by the picture but it definitely isn't anything like the picture.  Material is pretty thin and no stretch to it.  It's not a terrible shirt, it's actually a little more on the dressy side; however, I was looking for loose and comfy."
3.0,It was a cute pattern but when I ordered my normal size it was far too big on me to wear. Plus the fabric felt cheap and uncomfortable
3.0,It’s easy to use but make sure your Glasses are clean. Help with  stop glasses from Fogging with mask on.
3.0,It was what I expected from an imported product.
3.0,They fill the reason I bought them.  Indoor slippers that I can get in and out of easily and go outside when necessary.
3.0,Cut the glare but seemed to be too dark for night driving
3.0,A little on the big size.
3.0,I ordered medium the first time bc that’s the size I would wear according to the sizing chart. Returned for small and they’re still “off”. They are not sheer which is nice. The high rise is super high and the looseness of the fabric below the the high waist panel bunches and makes my pot belly even more obvious. The bottoms of the legs ride up and wrinkle. The burgundy color does it worse than the gray or black for some reason. Not the worst I’ve tried but this is an instance of getting what you pay for. They’re inexpensive but they also fit me poorly.
3.0,"Beautiful print.  I got the XXL for my (not overweight) 17 year-old and it's definitely not an XXL.  Most XXL sizes hang off him, I thought I was purchasing it large enough for him to have on a sweater or something underneath it, but this ""XXL"" is just not large enough. I would guess this would be an XXL in Japan or China, but not the U.S.  So, he was excited to receive this Christmas morning but disappointed he's not going to get to wear it. Long as you get the size right, it's pretty cool looking."
3.0,I was disappointed with the quality of the jewelry the hat the cigarette holder and the dress doesn’t look as pictured but it’s still good enough to purchase based on the price and the fact that it will work for a flapper event.
3.0,Didn’t fit my head that well
3.0,I wear a 36DD and bought an XL. Band is still too tight on me!
3.0,"My wife bought this bag and while she likes the bag, the adjustable straps don't stay adjusted. Every time you open the bag you have to readjust them. It bought this for the beach, we walk our dog and like to be hands free (toy throwing, shells, etc ) but need to carry my phone, keys, and water bottle. While the inside of the bag has plenty of pockets I only used the one zipper one and out side pocket. My wife is still searching for a bag, I'm going to use this for my ipad and accessories."
3.0,"El material esta perfecto, pero la mascara se siente pesada y es angosta, aprieta en la nuca ..."
3.0,"This shirt is great until it gets past your waist. I mean, it fits, but I could wear it as a dress. It's long. I like the top of it, and basically like the shirt, but it's super long. If you are very tall, it would probably be good, but at 5'2"", I'm not. Otherwise, the fabric is soft and it's nice."
3.0,Fast shipping.  A little large on my average sized head.
3.0,Really disappointed when I recieved this dress. The picture is deceiving. The actual letterings is silver and not gold. I got this this dress in a pinch and paid the extra buck for it.  Definitely wasn’t worth it for me.
3.0,Colors were a bit off the pic. Like the idea of the structure but seems to run a little small & is heavier than it looks. Comfortable.
3.0,"I had to return this product because it wouldn't be appropriate for work. It is more of a body con type dress. It fits snug and is formed to the body. I didn't think going up a size would help bc it is just the style of the dress. Otherwise, the style and color as are pictured."
3.0,"I don’t know if I would call them kids headphones, as they barely fit my 3.5 year old, and he’s not large"
3.0,Very pretty on my arm however the sparkles hurt when they dig into your wrist
3.0,"Nice to look at and matches the pump soap for Christmas but cheaply made, light weight."
3.0,"The dress is just okay and the material is sort of thin. For the price and the brand, I was expecting premium fabric so I was disappointed with the dress. I'm better off spending the same amount of money on a dress at Everlane, for example, where I'm always blown away by the quality of their materials."
3.0,Dress is beautiful.  Normally wear a Med. Too tight.  Reordered a Large-still too tight!  So disappointing!
3.0,Front sticker patch wasn't even on the jacket and runs small.
3.0,"Nice cardigan, the picture was accurate, and the size is as expected, I ordered the black so there were no issues with the color."
3.0,"The design is adorable, the printing looks really good for the price, but the shirt material is really itchy. I tried it on as soon as it came & immediately felt uncomfortable. I ran through the wash because I thought it might be from a chemical used during the printing process. Still itchy. I've yet to wear it for more than a few minutes and I'm a little scared to try it. There's no tag & i can't find anywhere on the listing that says what the material is made of. I would splurge a few extra bucks & go for a different shirt; especially if you have sensitive skin!"
3.0,I don't think it works. I still have problems watching my computer screen.
3.0,Looks great but easily broken if pulled on
3.0,It's nice too big.
3.0,"It’s cute but not on, it is too big and I look like a giant cotton ball. Other reviews said it runs small, it doesn’t."
3.0,"This is now quite what I expected when I ordered it.  First, it took a long time for it to be delivered....because it was coming from CHINA.  Again, not what I expected.  And I suspect this is not legally licensed product from the JURASSIC WORLD movie.  With that said, my son loved it (and his brother was jealous and wanted one).  But as a consumer this is not really what I was hoping to get.  We had ordered a truly 3D Jurassic World lunch box from Amazon a few months ago and the quality on that product was great.  So I was expecting the same thing with this and was disappointed. There is no real 3D affect on the drawing and the quality of the printing of the image is pretty poor."
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but way to heavy on my wrist
3.0,"This is a beautiful watch, undoubtedly. I wish I had paid more attention though and realized it didn't have a second hand, but I guess in the scheme of things that doesn't really matter. My main issue with this watch is that is a HUGE pain in the ass to adjust. I bought this over 3 weeks ago and just today managed to get it adjusted and on properly. I was so frustrated I almost wanted to just throw the damn thing away. It does look very pretty now that it's on, but the rose gold looks more gold than the pinkish hue I was looking for. Oh well."
3.0,"Husband likes it now that I fixed it.<br />His head is large and the velcro is not long enough!<br />I had to sew it at the very end, so he could ware it."
3.0,No instructions on how to clean no tags fits larege
3.0,"It's a fun, colrful, band for pride season. It's a bit on the stiff side, so I have to wear it a bit too snug, or else the blaze is levitating on my wrist. Maybe it'll loosen up with wear. It's not a heavy duty material."
3.0,Fit nice - quality as expected  - not high end but nice enough to throw on with a cute top.
3.0,Definitely should go up a size they run small so it’s going to be super tight on your arms. It looks exactly like the picture though same color and good quality.
3.0,Order a half size larger than you wear. Runs narrow too.Great quality loafers! I wish they fit me.
3.0,The quality of the dress is nice. It's lined inside and the material feels good. It is however very short. Not office suitable. Also if you are busty this dress offers no coverage on top. The slit goes all the way down and even with a cami underneath it's not wearable. Sent it back. But could work for a different body type.
3.0,It’s ok cheaply made and definitely you get what you pay for. The crotch area is straight stitched across so it bunches up when worn. But it’s perfect for my granddaughter to wear for practice. It’s a little on the bigger side but overall it’s good.
3.0,Soft but looks more like pajamas then an outfit to go out in
3.0,Fabric is not soft and flowing like it looks. Large fit in the crotch. I returned through Prime.
3.0,not as stylish as in the picture
3.0,The beads on the boots .
3.0,Loved the style and color.  Just too tight for medium warm socks
3.0,"They fit nice enough, comfortable and cute, but I should have gotten a size smaller. I went with the size chart provided but they are just. Abut too big"
3.0,"This ASUOAgio Women's Fuzzy V Neck Cropped Sweater isn’t quite what I was hoping for, though I suppose it is mostly as advertised.<br /><br />I’ll admit I purposely ordered a size that is too large for me. I ordered X large when really I would probably be a medium. I’m just not a fan of overly cropped shirts, so I thought this larger size may be better for wearing around the house. It is still quite cropped despite that, but I think I like this more than I would have liked a medium. It comes a little below my belly button depending on how I position the neckline.<br /><br />It is black in color. The fabric is pretty thick and fuzzy. It is fairly comfortable, but I found it to be somewhat scratchy at times. I personally don’t like the fabric. It might be okay for a blanket maybe, but it is weird, almost as if it is trying to mimic a weird fake fur.<br /><br />The tag states 70% nylon and 30% acrylic- Made in China. It says to hand wash, flat dry, and low iron, no dry cleaning.<br /><br />Aside from me not liking the fabric and how cropped it is, it seems decently put together. I just simply don’t like the style and how it looks. I suppose some might like the very casual laid-back look. The arms are also very long going past my hands a bit but I suppose it could also be the larger size I ordered.<br /><br />My overall opinion is that I don’t really like it, but the quality isn’t terrible. It just isn’t my preference in terms of fabric or style. I might still wear it around the house with a longer tank underneath, but it isn't flattering on me."
3.0,Not true to size. The sleeves fit really tight. But the material is nice. Really nice dress. Will be returning
3.0,Too large. Very thin fabric. It was okay.
3.0,Comfort for the kids
3.0,I ended up returning this item. I ordered the brown pair but was sent black. The material is lightweight and borderline cheap. Comfortable fit but it did not fit my face.
3.0,"Pants were awkwardly fitting, I used different pants. I wasn’t too fond of the material, but it’s super cute as a finished look."
3.0,It was fine for my costume but cheaply made for sure. Works if you aren't picky.
3.0,"These arm sleeves work well on the arm part but I am a bit disappointed with the hand section. They started to get runs in them almost immediately. Seems like the part of the sleeve that has the most interaction should be a good bit more enforced than they are. But if I am judging them solely on the compression part of them they work well, they fit comfortably and don't slide off."
3.0,Cool looking print..slightly thin through the body for a xxl
3.0,"i love nermal in the pocket, but this shirt is made out of this odd, saggy slippery material that pills kind of easily. i probably should've read better. the cat print is wrinkled too but not that bad"
3.0,I dislike cause I didn't get a chance to wear it cause both was broken I'm very very disappointed l like them but the pin break easy this showing both sides
3.0,The minnie mouse head gets in the way as my toddler tries to go up the stairs. Besides that the are cute slippers.
3.0,"The pattern is really cute but the pockets made the dress look really wide on my hips so I'm going to return :/. Wish I could keep it because it is very cute otherwise! Also, I would definitely wear it with leggings as for me it was too short as a dress."
3.0,The Materials of the watch its not good But just buy it in a good price 145$
3.0,"Cute purse, on the small side. I bought as a crossbody and it was a little short for my torso length, but still worked on the largest belt hole. I gave this a 3 star, because it stained my white dress, and I can’t get the stains out! Took it to Key West, and I’m not sure if it was the heat that caused it to rub off on my dress? Very disappointing."
3.0,This product runs a little small. Beautiful but small. I would suggest getting a size bigger that your regular size
3.0,"I got an XL and it fits like a medium, which doesn't work with my chest size well. Otherwise it's cute! I've gotten a few compliments on it already and wore it once so far."
3.0,Cute for a toddler but didn't fit my 7 year old.
3.0,It is not see through! I am 5’ 140lbs and a large was to big but it was too short for my comfort and quite bulky. A younger person might like this dress. The black was true black but I found the brown sort of off. I am 68.
3.0,"I would love to give this dress 5 stars, but I originally ordered it in a medium and it was a little snug (and the seam wouldn’t line up right in the back). So I ordered a large, and when I took it out of the bag the dress was wet. Not soaking wet, but very damp. The bag didn’t have any holes in it and it wasn’t raining that day. It was very odd. I wore the dress to my husband’s work Christmas party and received lots of compliments."
3.0,I bought these for the mid rise. I wish they were the same soft fabric as the yogalicious high rise leggings. Not over the moon about the softness of these leggings. Lots of stretch but they do get more see through the more they stretch so definitely not squat proof. I'll mostly wear these around the house as mom attire. Lol
3.0,"The first time this arrived, the glue holding the eyes to the mask was coming off and one eye was peeled off. I ordered a replacement and it was even worse - the eye was totally falling off. My kid likes the costume but the mask is not useable."
3.0,"Run small, my son wears about an 11 and he couldn’t wear the 11/12 way too tight. Cute slippers though"
3.0,These are a bit more flimsy than I thought they would be. I have very narrow feet and they slide around quite a bit. They might last one or two seasons.
3.0,Love the colors but it says sweatshirt material and the bottom doesn’t stretch. Very snug.
3.0,"It's what is pictured, there's just nothing showing its ACTUAL size.. I ordered these for gifts and the girls will never wear them, because😳😆"
3.0,"Cute, but didn't fit my ear."
3.0,Hard to zip
3.0,It's okay but looks a little cheap
3.0,Runs a little small but very cute.  Bought 2 for the proper fit.
3.0,Not the best fabric and doesn’t stretch on neck. Works ok
3.0,"Very cute bootees but hard for child to get on, and were too small for her although I got the item in her shoe size."
3.0,"Not as well-made as Machingers - a lot of the finger tips are stuck closed from the rubber coating and takes some work to get them opened up in order to be worn. The rubber seems a bit stiffer and not quite as grippy. Once they're all un-stuck the gloves seem to work fine, though I do think Machingers give superior grip.  I bought these to lend to my quilting students to try out and to serve as backups for myself when my Machingers go astray -  they are entirely sufficient for that purpose.  They breathe well and are pretty comfortable to wear for long periods."
3.0,I disliked the fact that the color was so off. They had a olive tint to them. Had to return them.
3.0,"I did not realize how big these were.  I have short hair and a small head, so they look fairly ridiculous on me."
3.0,It fades after a couple of months.
3.0,The logo was small and not straight.  Looks like a knock off.  The hat is good quality though.  Let’s see if the son will wear it.  It’s a gift.
3.0,Cute but red color is very faded
3.0,Good quality and fit for the price. Material is not thick but not too thin.
3.0,They're really pretty but the earring it self is really not sturdy came bent luckily I'm not using these to wear as earrings I was attaching them to my flower girl's basket as decoration
3.0,"The Pin is made well; however, it arrived almost a week late. The seller, when contacted, made little to no effort other than saying, “tracking shows in route”"
3.0,"Had to return. Ordered a small and it was still too big! Reviews said it runs small, so I think they possibly sent the wrong size. Its really cute though. Bummed I had to return it and wont need it now that Halloween is over."
3.0,"Colors looked different on the website, I thought it was black on the bottom its brown a little disappointed"
3.0,"I bought them for a play I was in. They definitely lasted through the four weekend run. They were a bit bulky, and would have impacted my speech negatively, so I just used the bottom, and it was fine.<br /><br />While I appreciate the inclusion of extra molding material, It's nearly impossible to remove once applied. So if I had messed up, I would NOT have put in the effort to replace it."
3.0,Tight on my boobs (32ddd) but that’s as to be expected. Shrinks a lot in the wash. Only got one wear out of it but it looks just like the photos and was very cute!
3.0,I bought a couple different balaclavas as I work in outside construction in the Northeast. This one has a seam down the middle that leaves a mark on your forehead if you're wearing a hard hat/helmet. It's a bit uncomfortable. The area for your eyes has a stitched seem that is NOT elastic and therefore this balaclava cannot be worn just around the neck (you'd choke yourself trying to fit your head through the eye opening). It's not bad against wind protection but it would be if there was more elasticity. Not a bad price for two of them though!
3.0,Fits small but its stretchy!!!
3.0,Its a very cute bikini! But I got it because I love bikinis & im pretty plumped & I wanted something that would look good. But I don't like how it makes my fat rolls pop out really bad :( the top is adorable but I can't get the bottoms to look good! I would recommend to someone who is small to medium body type! I think it would look better on someone smaller Than me! I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review!
3.0,"The cloth quality is poor, but the sizing is perfect."
3.0,"The belt is fine.  The warning I'd give is that it isn't exactly adjustable, so if your kid varies by more than an 1.5 inches (length of Velcro buckle) you'd be out of luck."
3.0,"This is actually a very pretty little bracelet but I want to stress that it is a little bracelet. It lays nicely on my wrist so I guess the word I would use to describe it is dainty. I have worn this a few times and so far it has survived without any issue. It is easy to put on if you are used to this type of clasp. Given that is it on the dainty side I don't wear it with any of my other bracelets, it is something to be worn alone. This makes things a little tough for me since I tend to wear more than 1 bracelet at a time.<br />It is a pretty bracelet and a nice accent piece but for me it is a little too dainty and not being able to wear other bracelets with it means I don't wear it as much as I would like too."
3.0,The butterfly is nice but the chain is a little cheap. I moved the butterfly to a different chain and its super cute.
3.0,I like it but it was a little tighter then expected.
3.0,So I was going on a trip and instead of lugging around a huge wallet or purse I purchased this! It was great until I was walking around sight seeing and the wristlet part broke off of the wallet. (This was within my first hour of use) I can still use it as a wallet however the point was to have the wristlet piece. Otherwise decent wallet for the price!
3.0,Flower was smashed so item was returned.
3.0,"I love these boots the texture of the fabric, the look and style is awesome they are very comfortable, my only problem that actually was major is that the top part of the boot where the zipper stop did not stay up. They kept folding down when I walk, eventually I had to fix my problem by completely folding them down to be able to enjoy my night. I had planned to order more items but not sure about the future. I also ordered my sisters boots for her and my niece ordered prior and that’s how I learned about your site."
3.0,"It worked well when I first tried on prior to washing, but then washing it even in cold shrunk it down a little more and I couldn't get the zipper to go past my chest seam."
3.0,"Beautiful looking Scarf, however,  it has an overwhelming smell of perfume. I could not stop sneezing and coughing. I had to wash it 5 times."
3.0,Waaaay to big for comfort! They look small in picture but they are giant in person never put them on! Gave them away
3.0,Order a size larger.  Fabric is nice and it is well made.
3.0,"what I dislike is that I thought I clearly understood the socks to be ""crew"" length or half of the calf length.  they are not and are heavier than I expected having bought this brand from other sources.<br />It's my fault that I did not deal with this situation before the return window closed"
3.0,"The top fit me wonderfully but the bottom was NOT a small. There was no way I could fit my small butt in there, it seemed to be a large/medium instead. I just pair the top with another bottom."
3.0,"Well, it's smaller than I expected it to be. The single is somehow stupid thing. It caused me problems on my face"
3.0,My little girl loves it. Fits perfectly. Only complaint is that it expels a lot of glitter.
3.0,"These costumes are really big and the parts of the costume that are supposed to be pink are actually red. Having said that, my girls absolutely love these costumes!  I haven't tried washing them yet but they are very comfortable and easy to wear."
3.0,I love this outfit. Only negative thing is that the bottom where it has the &#34;button&#34; things when it is buttoned up they have gaps between the buttons allowing skin to show even it its loose on my baby
3.0,Didn't care for
3.0,"It serves the purpose as a carrying strap.  I like the spandex loops for easier on and off, but the strap is definitely not as long as pictured.  The top tip of the triangle is probably only half way compare to the picture.  It is long enough to carry behind your shoulder though, so I'm keeping it."
3.0,Seemed small
3.0,Was too small. Had to give it away.
3.0,I followed the sizing guide and did a size up but it was still a bit too small so I recommend sizing up twice. Hopefully I can return it and get a new one before Halloween.
3.0,"Too large, giving away"
3.0,Too thick and smaller than expected
3.0,"These are great for their purpose. I have cataracts and spend a good bit of time in front of screens, so these have really helped reduce glare and eyestrain.<br /><br />I've bought four pairs over the past two years. Two problems that earn them 3 stars inst of 5:<br /><br />First, they fall apart (earpieces come off) very easily. Never had this problem with other reading glasses. And the spring hinges make them difficult to repair.<br /><br />Second, the last two pairs, purchased within the past 6 months, made my sensitive skin break out. The first two pairs did not do this, so I have to wonder what has changed at Eyeklepper's plastics supplier or in the finishing process."
3.0,The pockets make the sides look bulky.
3.0,I typically get a large but these were small for a large.  They were difficult to remove sans fingers.  Nice leather however.
3.0,"Nice, just too big of a top for 6yr old"
3.0,I had hoped to wear this as a dress but it is extremely short on me. The style and colors are great so I will use as a swimsuit cover up.
3.0,Hard to get on. Not as nice as pictured. Stiff material. Should slip on easier. Runs small.
3.0,I like them but they’re really tight on your head.
3.0,"I ordered a size up and it still barely fits. Otherwise it's good except the pockets fit 3 fingers, not like actual for your hand, phone, or wallet size."
3.0,Doesn’t really fit as fitted looking as the picture makes it seem.  I’m 5’6 120lb and the small is still a little flowy and not at all fitted as it appears.
3.0,Sizing was off at least 4 sizes
3.0,It didnt fit properly very loose
3.0,Not very fitting or flattering. Not comfy to me. Not material I was expecting.
3.0,"Very cute, but if you have a long torso, it won't fit"
3.0,My girlfriend liked it but 4 of the stones has already fell out in one day
3.0,Had a very positive experience with a previous set of Puma Worker socks; but these one are not as comfortable and cushioning. Moreover durability is also not matching
3.0,"I really liked these, they look cute and fit well, but after only one or two wears some of the seams came apart and I had holes in the sides of the socks.  I wouldn't purchase these again."
3.0,The pink beads turn my wrist pink. Other than that I really like them.
3.0,"Not as &#34;nice&#34; as I expected, but good with jeans.  Sleeves fit interestingly.  The sleeves are a little long and the part at the upper arm poofs out."
3.0,"Great and warm. However, not great for a quick jaunt outside to get the paper."
3.0,"i mean, its an alright shirt. quality is pretty low. the material feels like a weird fake silky type cloth. kind of feels like a stretchy bathing suit almost. NOT BREATHABLE AT ALL. this will make you sweat if working out or it is hot out. A LOT of loose strings on the inside of the shirt, around the bottom and top. bought an extra large, normally wear large/extra large and its pretty snug. its stretchy but will not stretch out, so i guess thats kind of good. all in all, pretty ok cat surfing on pizza shirt"
3.0,"It's flimsier than it looks, and quite small, and it wouldn't make a good gift because it looks cheap. But there's nothing wrong with it exactly, so I'm rating it as OK. It came with a &#34;free gift&#34; that's a bit of a joke - the sort of little metal chain that dog tags come on or that companies sometimes use to attach their cardboard brand label. No idea why anyone would consider this a &#34;gift&#34; - it's something you usually throw away."
3.0,"Fits kinda weird, I have smaller shoulders so it keeps sliding around have to arrange alot."
3.0,Don't like the post being at the end it should be in the middle they don't lay right on your ear
3.0,Good quality. Fit well. the arms could be a bit longer. I'm about 180lbs 5'6. I bought a XL
3.0,Cute hat but to small for me!  However it fit my 9yr old great.  Retrurning
3.0,Cute but starting to fade and snag on clothes
3.0,"the color doesn't match the bright green, this green is more like a avocado green, a little bit disappointed"
3.0,"It's kind of mediocre in every respect. I didn't find it exceptionally soft. It doesn't look particularly good on me, and it doesn't keep me warmer than another sweater.<br /><br />I think it boils down to the materials not being very good. I'm not sure what it's made of by feel - just that it isn't very pleasant. Perhaps this justifies the low price? But even then I've had cheaper things that satisfy at least one of the aforementioned uses of a sweater better than this does.<br /><br />Perhaps in some rare cases you want a sweater than is just all around average - not great at anything but not bad at anything either. This will be the ideal pick for you."
3.0,"Super cute and comfortable but I would recommend sizing down as it stretched out very quickly with daily wear.  I didn’t get it wet or so anything else that could attribute to the stretching,  put it in in the morning and took it off at night."
3.0,Not as big as I wanted it to be I do like it but was hoping for a larger size it fits small to medium it is not as large as the picture makes it look unless you have a very small child like head or a empty head with no brain this is the ideal hat.
3.0,Definitely worked but needed two pairs. The heel went thru the first pair very quickly. Fortunately had a back up which lasted the rest of the night
3.0,"I was so excited for this dress, but was a bit disappointed when I received it. It runs much later than I expected, I normally wear a medium but this looks and fits like a large going into an extra large. The fabric of the dress is stretchy and thick, which is great for that drapey effect with this kind of dress but because it’s on the thicker side the knot in front of the chest area bulges out a lot so it makes your chest look huge. I am not a big fan of that since I already have a pretty good size chest.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. All of the review is all my own thoughts and opinions, not associated in anyway with the seller or the company. After using the product, I want to help users to get honest reviews, and help them with their purchases after spending my own money on products."
3.0,"Fits as expected. Nice smoky blue. Too large a chest makes the wrap part wrinkle. Being thin would make this a whole lot cuter. I'm measuring the cute factor against my body. However,  I'm going to keep it."
3.0,"Nice suit but didn't fit. Too long in the body and skirt is a good length in the front, but too short in the back. The bra cups are loose inside the top and float around."
3.0,"It fit perfect. How ever, cheap material, thread was loose on some parts of shirt, very thin material. Not worth the price. But its a cute outfit."
3.0,"This dress is NOT made for tall women. I really wanted to love this dress because it is stunning, but it is 2 inches too short. I would say this is an ideal for 5'6 girls or shorter. I am 5'8 and 1/2 and weigh 160lbs and bought a large for the extra length. The fit was great, roomy but not too roomy but the length was just too dang short. Such a shame!"
3.0,It runs small I'm usually a small/xsmall I ordered medium and it was still short
3.0,"I bought these for water aerobics. I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe wide.  Easy to slip on.  Insert is junk as it slid all around the base with aerobics.  I threw them out and it was better.  For general pool side, these would be fine, but not for aerobics."
3.0,"The cotton mask is not rated N95 or rated anything at all nor is filtering viruses mentioned anywhere.  Cotton fabric masks are supposed to work for the Corona Virus so it's reasonable to give it a try.<br />One of the 3 masks has an adjustable nose clip.  I feel this is an important feature to seal around the nose and they forgot to install it into 2 of the 3 masks.  The mask Is form fit below the chin and along with its adjustable ear loops the mask feels like it does a reasonable job of sealing except around the nose.<br />There is no exhaust port on this mask.  Its a basic layered cotton material.  4 layers if you count the pocket to hold the charcoal bag.  Charcoal works in water to filter but unknown if it filters the air.  Per experts, “Carbon and charcoal are meant to filter contaminants from water,” May Chu, Ph.D., a clinical professor of epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health Anschutz Medical Center, tells Mental Floss. “We don’t know if breathing in charcoal fragments or particles is good for your lungs.”  The inside fabric is smooth and comfortable against the face.<br /> Short of having a certified N95 mask or a mask that specifies filtering virus,  these cotton masks would be much better than wrapping a scarf around your face.  I'm disappointed in the poor quality control to deliver masks without the noise clip though."
3.0,I bought this to take pictures with my daughter. It looked super cute for her but for me was a complete joke. Please make sure to measure for yourself. What threw me off is the picture in the listing which is absolutely incorrect.
3.0,"Well made casket, but had no name plates on lid, which was the main reason why I chose this one over others."
3.0,"This dress runs large. I am 5'6&#34; 145lbs W28 H40 B35 and it reaches about 3 inches past my knee. Something is off about the cut, it does not sit the way it should, however i will still give thee benefit of the doubt and say that a small would have fitted much better"
3.0,"ZKHOECR women's long sleeve shoulder cut out top. This purple top is cute with the shoulder are cut out but the arm area nder the arms droops down awkwardly. The top appears to be loose and flowing but if you have a little belly it will cling to it. The top overall is a akward fit and doesnt lay like it does on the model. I recieved a size large which I knew would be big on me but I put it on my sister who is bigger than I am and wears a large and it was still a akward fit but more flattering on her. The material is good and the quality is nice. The jewel toned purple is pretty but overall this was a pass for me. I am a 34D, 111lbs and 5'4, my sister is a 36C, 5'10 and 180lbs."
3.0,"Cute, but way too short!"
3.0,"Ordered an L and it is snug across the breast...fits, but no extra room<br />Material cheap😐"
3.0,These shoes seem to run narrow in the toe box.
3.0,"True these have blue hue tint. False on the spring  hinge, there's none. I buy blue tint glasses  (hard to find ) for singing students score studies . This is the perfect tint for that purpose. Spring hinge would have been great, instead of misleading, as I purchased more than 1 pair. 5 stars for color."
3.0,"A little too much going on with this wallet.  When you add your credit cards, money, etc. it gets very thick."
3.0,What was received looks kinda like the photo but the pockets are so small. They are deff not deep pockets like the ones shown. They also are not skinny joggers like described. They are soft but look to short for a size 14.
3.0,Earrings was cute when I first got them but then the pearl came out
3.0,"Very cute shirt , loved the print and material , however it is a little big , especially in the under arm area it fits weird ."
3.0,The jacket was not as  Form fitting as the pictures showed
3.0,I am small chested and I ordered an extra size but it was still too small for me
3.0,Couldn’t get on past my hips. Pants felt nice and light.
3.0,Good for use in the shower but not for extended wear.  Not very soft and a bit narrow.
3.0,I love the look and feel of this keychain; however it broke within a couple of days.  The dangling part slipped off the chain and won't stay on.
3.0,"Well I bought these with the sole purpose of being a work boot out in the fields (my job doesn't require steel toe). I realized, though that they really have minimal support and really look too good to get muddy. Which brings me to my first point.<br />1. These things look freakin good. Like really good.<br />2. They break in really easy and fast. Like a moccasin with a thick sole.<br /><br />However,<br />3. I'm sure a little research would clarify this, but I don't understand why there is an ipath tag on the shoe but it comes in a box with the name 'Oliberte'.<br />4. I found the same shoe on roozt.com and they claim that this company empowers impoverished Africans by giving them job. I hate to say it, but that might be evident in the quality. I noticed a few frays in stitching after only one week."
3.0,Very comfy and stretchy but not nearly as flattering as the pic. It’s pretty true to size but the crotch/booty are drops much lower and is not flattering on the hips and thighs.
3.0,"love the jeans but fit small. I would suggest orderin a size up,"
3.0,Loved the suit but had to order down a size because the leg openings were way too big.
3.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my 6-year old.  She loves eccentric hats and wears them everywhere, so this along with &#34;Who Was Amelia Earhart&#34; were an obvious choice.  The hat is absolutely adorable.  She gets comments and complements every time she wears it.  It fits her well and the goggles stay put weather she wears them up or down.  (The hat even fit us parents- because of course you try something that cute on yourself when it arrives)<br /><br />It saddens me that she's chosen to lay this hat aside lately.  She simply can't wear it without the goggle &#34;lenses&#34; falling out.  It's a thin piece of &#34;leather&#34; and the lenses have only a shallow rim around them so they tend to fall out even with gentle use.  Our next step will be to try a bead of super glue around the edge, but I hesitate to do it for fear of it ruining the look of the hat, as the rim really isn't deep enough to hide a bead of glue.<br /><br />I'd probably order one of these again.  She has gotten SO much enjoyment out of it in the three weeks she wore it that it's been worthwhile.  I just wish it was still going strong."
3.0,Broke 1st day.....
3.0,The material is very thin. Style of the shirt look good.
3.0,For the most part seemed sturdy but the bottom that rubs on wrist irritated my husband.<br />Could not wear for long period of time so that did not work.<br />Sent back.
3.0,Really cute but broke after a few months
3.0,"Very cute outfit, however it was way too big for my baby! Runs bigger than usual. Pants are pajama like"
3.0,"The belt was 45"" long instead of 47"""
3.0,very bright fabric
3.0,I like the color of this tracksuit it is very bright and it fits nicely. I did think it would be more of a cloth like material but it is spandex like so the material is not very warm to wear in cooler weather. This outfit would be better to wear around the house or lounging.
3.0,fear. not very good quality.
3.0,"Really cute, but for a wide foot."
3.0,"Very cute, but definitely for folks with smallish ears. I don't have very big ears and it hurt to wear."
3.0,Straps need to be wider to be comfortable
3.0,It did leave my platinum chain like new but only downfall is for me idk about anybody else is that when i was finished cleaning it i put it on for a few minutes and the next day i got a bad rash on my back of my neck idk it was the components in the cloth or what what left my skin on my next very irradiated
3.0,Scratches very very easily. Will hurt the ridge of the nose or around the ears if worn for a long period. Definitely wish that these were more comfortable.
3.0,"it looked and felt good but was large for me and so didnt provide the support i required, I returned it no problem"
3.0,Didn't fit loose like it's supposed to. It just fits
3.0,"Super cute dress in the picture but when received the dress was bigger than expected. The arm cuffs were dangling a lot and it was not as slimming as the picture made it look. There was even a rip on the side of the dress. I am 5'4 and 145lbs with a 34D cup. I thought the dress was not very flattering on me, so I am returning."
3.0,A fair cycling jersey with a few shortcomings. The jersey material is of good quality. The print has a professional appearance. The fit is good with one exception. The jersey sleeves are tight on the upper portion of the arm. The other negative of the jersey is the zipper. It is very large compared to all of my other cycling jerseys. If the sleeves were a little more proportional to the jersey and the zipper was of a much smaller profile this would be an excellent jersey.
3.0,Too loose in the waist
3.0,I love this bag. I use it everyday. I like that you can use it as a backpack or switch it to a long shoulder
3.0,I like the way the bottom fits except the top is definitely way to small for a large breasted woman.  It puckers in some areas and just doesn't fit right at all. I got it for a trip and will more than likely just keep it for the back yard it's easier than returning it. I think you get what you pay for in this case. I should have stuck to the 100.00 ones from kohls. 😞
3.0,"much larger than anticipated *outer rim*, front detached from one. I was able to reattach it, but you can tell it's just not the highest quality, which is frustrating for the price I paid. pretty, though, and definitely real steel, i'm not having any reactions to them."
3.0,"It's very pretty, just too big."
3.0,For the price it is a great dress
3.0,"Nice and wide - just as advertised.  But very cheap plastic frame.  Good enough sunglasses, but not great.  Price needs to be under $15."
3.0,The print is off center really bad. Luckily I was around a bunch of people drinking so no one noticed but it bothered me.
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, just too small in the arms."
3.0,"Pros:  I like the bright and flashy colors of these sleeves.<br />Cons:  The material feels like a thin T shirt and it doesn't have much stretch to it.  These top and bottom and the thumb hole are just barely hemmed enough to keep them from unraveling.  The way it is hemmed causes the ends to curl to the outside which causes the sleeve to want to roll back down my arm.  To counteract this problem, I wear the sleeves inside out and they stay up on my arms fine.<br />Overall:  These are inexpensive sleeves that you can make work by wearing them inside out if that doesn't bother you."
3.0,Seems we’re coming apart before I even opened the package.
3.0,It ran very small nothing like I expected.
3.0,More for occasional use and for fun.
3.0,"The design is beautiful, the fit was wonderful. The problem I have is that the material used gave me a seriously bad skin reaction. After having the plugs in for only a day, a putrid odor became very prominent. I took the plugs out and  my ears were red, irritated, and oozing liquid that reeked of infection. Now, I have had plugs for 2 years and I have never had this problem prior to this purchase. When I took out the plugs I was wearing to put these ones in I cleaned the old plugs, my ears, and the new plugs before putting them in my ears and in about 24 hours I had to take them out clean them, and my ears. I wound up putting my old plugs back in and though my ears are still irritated, the smell is gone and I am no longer oozing putrid liquid from my piercing site."
3.0,Nice shirt but the white is very translucent... you will need another shirt or cami to wear underneath which defeats the purpose of wearing as a sun shirt during hot weather riding.
3.0,Looks very sexy on but not that comfortable
3.0,These are super cute and comfortable enough not super special but the aesthetic of them makes me happy.
3.0,"I tried to cancel this shortly after I ordered it after looking at people who modeled it and posted selfies but Amazon wouldn't let me.  I did try it on and it fits weird, almost as if the top and bottom of the dress weren't aligned correctly before sewing together. (I used to make all of my own clothes) I'm a size 5 so it's not my size."
3.0,Very cute shoes my daughter loves them but a lot of minor details that do bother me and are quite noticeable  I tried removing the pen markings but couldn't
3.0,"As other reviewers have said, buy at least two sizes larger than your normal fit. I usually wear Victoria's Secret size medium, so I ordered the X-Large in these (despite how it made me wince and feel dysmorphic and self-hating to do so), and it's still uncomfortably tight sometimes, particularly if water retention is a factor. Still a good deal for the price."
3.0,These seemed a little on the thin side considering I got black ones from the same brand that we're better than this. It does what it needs to for me and my team for now
3.0,"I like these earrings, but the “candy” was a small let down. I considered those who see them won’t be close enough to see the imperfections I see., so I kept them. They were less than 5 dollars when I bought them, and I think the quality is equal to the price."
3.0,Cute but not flattering. 5’11” 165 lbs and made me lumpy.
3.0,"This was okay and served it's purpose as part of a costume for a fourth grader reenacting the California Bear Flag Revolt. However, I was a little disappointed with the construction of the tail. I really appreciated how quickly the seller got it shipped out to me. If you need a coonskin cap in a hurry this would be the way to go."
3.0,The quality is cheap and the material is thin. I have a long torso and this was very tight on my shoulders and the back went up my bottom. Also my breasts kept popping out if the top because it was very low.
3.0,"Odd shape. Not sure how to get the front to drape right, like in photo."
3.0,"For the price, it's not bad.  I plan to use these for my bridesmaids dresses and for the one-time use, they will be just fine. Beware, they run big and have no way of tightening, unless you tie a knot in the back.  That's what I'll have to do for most of my bridesmaids."
3.0,"Got them for work, was disappointed to find that they cause sweating under ring.  This caused skin to peel under ring which is why I cannot use them for the purpose that I purchased them for."
3.0,Not shiny like stated in other reviews
3.0,It was too short and not a soft material as shown in the pic
3.0,Love it came on time
3.0,"It was nice, i bought a small and im 5’5 140 lbs with 36c cup.  The shirt is good material, I just like my toos a little more fitted when it comes to the cut of shirt."
3.0,Purchased for my 3 year old... Very thin! Wouldn’t purchase again.
3.0,Arrived fast no hassle but fit oddly on my ears only singles no pairs and some just hang
3.0,"I want to love this dress! It's beautiful! I am 5'5&#34; ,size 8-10, 38DDD. It's WAY tight in the top. It was tight on my arms, shoulders, and definitely nowhere close to covering the girls. I'm used to stuff being small in that area but I had to wear a tank under it to help cover me. Also you can tell it's cheaply made. Lots of random loose strings. It is a beautiful dress, very flattering, but if you are big uptop, be warned!"
3.0,Good for houseware but not to the gym
3.0,"Nice quality, runs very small and returned"
3.0,These were really cute but very hard to put on. Some of the base pieces came off while putting them on. I tried gluing them and for some it worked others it didn’t.  Normally I would return them but they were a gift and I didn’t have time to get something else. I kind of wish o did though because some of the ones I glued  began to fall off. If you have a way to permanently affix them then yes get them if not be prepared.
3.0,"I decided to give this a try since I'm looking to add more wool to my wardrobe since it's basically nature's ideal performance fabric.<br />However, not all wool is created equal. While the tag ""Merino"" often means a high-quality wool spun from longer, finer fibers resulting in smooth soft knits, this one isn't to that level.<br />It's somewhat thicker and chunkier than I expected, making it harder to use as a layering piece. It also is a tad itchy and already pilling after two wears.<br />Compared to other Merino in my wardrobe (that honestly only cost maybe $10 more), it's an inferior product.<br />I'll be using all my wool care tricks to make the best of it, but I wouldn't buy from this brand again. It fits fine and is quite warm, but it's not the quality of wool I was hoping for."
3.0,"Fits as expected but the fabric is too shiny, it makes it looks weird."
3.0,"I'm not a hippie kinda guy; however, these pull across the hips to the point that the pockets & zipper don't lay flat. If you order them, go up a size. Other than that, they fit well in the waist & are very stylish."
3.0,Loved the fit but too short in length. I'm 5ft8 and all legs. I need at the very least a 33 inseam. Had to return.
3.0,Perfect bracelet for young girls.  Well done in its arrangement of attachments.
3.0,These are super cute and I love the pattern. I ordered the white pair and the are pretty see through but I think I can get away with wearing nude undergarments or a pair of leggings under. I'm 5'5 and 145 lbs and when I first got these I thought there was no way the would fit but they are very stretchy and super baggy. For the price I would definently recommend these.
3.0,"This bra is made with a silky smooth material and feels amazing. It fits as expected. I ordered an XL and I typically wear a 38DD, for reference. It is comfortable - doesnt ride up, move around, or gouge into any skin. The reason I'm giving this only 3 stars is the shape of the cups could use improvement. It may fit different on someone else but I was not pleased with the shape. For simply wearing around the house it would be fine and comfortable. I would not wear this out in public."
3.0,There's not exactly a size to these things but the person I brought it for loved it nontheless. It'll have to be modified a little to fit them better however
3.0,Goggles preformed good but they sent me the wrong color and it was to close to our ski trip to send back. I received black goggles instead of white
3.0,"They are... so. cute. Very bendy. One lens popped out, but I could easily pop back in. I give 3 stars because they don't really stay on my daughter's little pip of a nose very well, but I don't know if any sunglasses would do much better."
3.0,"Cute suit, just didn't suit my body type - made my shoulders look too broad. Nice material and construction though."
3.0,What stretch they’re made of brass<br /><br />They’d better without the design
3.0,The skirt is nice but not made for petite women.  5'1 @ 115lbs... it was my fault because I did not read the size discreption very well the skirt hit me mid calf not a very flattering look for me..
3.0,"So, I really wanted my five month twin grandbabies to have the Polar Express sleeper for the holidays. The first day I looked at it the price was about $36. The next time I logged in the price had gone up again. I decided to not order the sleepers, but then I received an Amazon card from someone so I ordered them. The sleepers are cute, but the material is pretty thin. Overall, the two sleepers cost over $90. They are absolutely not worth it. Not very good quality and thin."
3.0,"Loved the look and design of this product and am currently wearing it now, but the silicon watch cover does not fit snugly around the face of the watch (see attached pic).  As a result, I have issues accessing the watch wheel and have to adjust the cover to make sure it isn’t covering the screen.  A bit disappointing as the style is very cute."
3.0,"I received my hat, and very happy with the quality,<br />but the only problem is that was shipped in a bag and the hat was partially smash...<br />—Item like this should be shipped in a box!!!"
3.0,"Comfy shirt, but it's huge, and very unflattering, definitely not worth the price"
3.0,"These sunglasses come in a box, in that is a case, in that is plastic wrapped, in that is wrapping for the glasses and the stems.  As a guy with a large head, these are a bit too small as I'm stretching them to go on.  The lenses are monotone with no gradation.  If you are a woman and need sunglasses for water sports/kayaking, etc. then these will do fine.  For guys or anyone else not into watersports you may want to look elsewhere.  They are nice, but there is not much wow factor here.  Especially when they squeeze your temples.  ;-)"
3.0,"It looks good, and the can be machine washed first time it smells bad."
3.0,The length was great as I have trouble with finding pants looking enough. The fit in the thighs and butt were a little snugger then I wanted for a work pant.....I am also not someone that wear stretch pants so I think I just felt a bit uncomfortable in them.
3.0,Not a bad product. Not use to nose rings yet!! Lol!!
3.0,Shirt is cute and a good deal for the price. If you have anything but extra small upper arms don't get it though. I have extremely small upper arms and the sleeves are still very very tight on me. Not as comfortable to wear as it looks. Also slightly too mush fabric around the body part. Pillowy. Ill probably only wear this shirt for a cute picture.
3.0,My body details: 4’11 155 weight size M and L is average women’s tops<br />It’s a bit too short for my taste. Being 4’11 I have a short torso normally. Like the color and the ribbed fabric on the outside. Not a fan of the liner fabric.
3.0,I ordered these after reading reviews.  I have some that were more expensive but as the saying goes &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  There were only 5 bracelets out of the 12 that I liked.  A couple were too small.  I'm not sure a child could even wear them.  I would not recommend them.
3.0,I love the shirt it’s just way to small . I ordered and EXL and it’s more like a small
3.0,they liked it-part of costume
3.0,Fits long and large
3.0,"Decent quality pendant,  black rope quality okay, cheap metal clasp and a cheap metal chain extension.  But priced right so I was okay with the cheap metal chain portion."
3.0,"Not sure what I was expecting. It's light, thin, and definitely (butt) cheeky. While my partner enjoys it, it's definitely not in my slumber party or loungewear arsenal. Not upset with the purchase, but it's not the first thing I reach for when I want to throw on something comfy."
3.0,It was very soft and comfortable. I had to wear long John's under neither as it did show a little too much. The hood was oversized so the eyes kept falling to one side or the other.
3.0,"I was looking for a comfortable, stretchy ankle pant, but what I got was a comfortable, stretchy capri. I'm very short (5'3), and was initially concerned they'd be too long (as most non-petite pants are on me). As it is, they absolutely fit more of a capri-length description than ankle pant. Very disappointed."
3.0,It keeps snagging my hair :( ouch
3.0,"Fit well, cheap looking, returned"
3.0,Bought it for husband he Love it but he says it’s very thin and not very soft. Fits true to size and design is awesome
3.0,The draw string in back doesn’t stay tight
3.0,"It's a beautiful jacket, but it's so small I will never be able to wear it. I can't button the top 3 buttons and I bought the largest size they had."
3.0,Smaller then excepted but nice hat
3.0,"I wear a size 13...ordered  a 13.  They were too small, returned them....otherwise ok"
3.0,"I loved this dress, and it is a perfect color for me. But the dress was super tight in the best. I am a 38DD. So maybe a C would work."
3.0,"I have a fat earlobe and the earring is currved so that it won't go thru the hole in the earlobe, will install better hooks.  The amber is a very pretty honey color."
3.0,I really like the shirt but I think the tail is a bit too short.  Makes the shirt look small on me.
3.0,"Amazon's service was great...….My husband usually wears a size large....so we ordered the XL,,,,<br />and he really could have ordered even the largest size available....size is way off!"
3.0,Very light shower shoe made in China.O.K. for the Gym or any public shower area.
3.0,It is much smaller than expected but I still like wearing it. It smells like cheap metal and chemicals though.
3.0,Couldn't ascertain any help with the pain.
3.0,"Not quite as bright gold as in the product photo but still pretty. The chain was a bit short for the top I was wearing. Would work best on a shirt with a tight neckline as the necklace fits as a collar might on a button down shirt.<br /><br />Ended up trying it on my 2.5 yo daughter and it fit just right. She had a lot of fun wearing a big girl necklace.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the necklace is not particularly sturdy. The necklace is 4 separate plates linked together in the back with small rings. I think this is meant to allow the necklace to have a bit more fluidity so it's comfortable to wear. But they can separate without much effort and ours fell apart after the single wear for our family photos. I think I can jerry rig it back together with a trip to a Michaels. If you're not into having to fix it up, might not be the right necklace for you."
3.0,They're okay. Made of VERY cheap fabric. The size fit a little smaller than expected.
3.0,color is nice - dress is very pretty - the bows fell off within 1 hour of wearing - but the dress seems to be made well
3.0,I like it it just a tad bit small for me
3.0,The shirts are cute but one arrived ripped. I don’t have time to return since I need them for a themed birthday party that’s tomorrow.
3.0,I love the look of this watch. Only downside is that the battery died after a few months.
3.0,It's a nice bag but it's been over a month and it still has a strong smell.
3.0,"Guess I should have really dug deep and read more reviews or investigated these in more detail. Not to say they are bad or defective but the design is quite different. They fold and twist in 1/2 but the arms are extendable meaning they pull out, they seem heavy to me on the front and very light weight on the arms so they tend to fall forward, clarity is not bad, case is light weight and seems to work well. Comes with a cleaning lens cloth not saying these are bad, just saying had I seen a review more like the one I'm writing I doubt I would have made this purchase."
3.0,"These shipped & arrived sooner than I was expecting them...bonus!! I was super excited when I ordered these cause they are so cute & im always looking for unique workout attire. So when they finally arrived I immediately put them on. However they were very snug, the material was stretched out a good bit & was nearly see through. I used the size chart & ordered accordingly but they were a little to tight. I still have a little weight to lose so I'm gonna try them again when I drop down another size. I still love them & think they are so cute but they did run small for me. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I only review products that I am willing to purchase & use regularly. I am a consumer that relies on reviews from others to help make purchasing decisions on in store & on line purchases. All of my reviews are 100% honest based on my experience with the product."
3.0,"I needed a watch for basic training, and so I got the cheapest one I could find in case it got battered. Can certainly say it’s waterproof, but the built in light is hot garbage. It’s also smaller than I thought it would be, but hey if you need a watch that you won’t get worried about destroying, this should be your pick!"
3.0,It’s a comfortable dress
3.0,I do like.. but it is not off the shoulder.. so I will have to take it somewhere to get it how I want it off the shoulder...
3.0,Thin material. Very light fabric. I don't see this lasting very long. Cute color though.
3.0,The fit was too small
3.0,Very thin and mine tore and the hem the first wash but very cute and light weight
3.0,"Had the picture actually reflected the product I received, I would not have purchased this item. If you want a more durable toe sock, try Mato & Hash. The last time I purchased M&H, they were wortth the price I paid. But it seems that products purchased on Amazon typically degrade in quality over time; meaning the manufacturers tend to start using cheaper materials during production.<br />But hey, that's just the American way nowadays"
3.0,not really spa socks..just fluffy socks
3.0,"Came broke, a clasp was broken off. However with hot glue it was a easy fix. Overall good condition, and flexible for next sizes. All gems in the snakes were intact."
3.0,Quality is nowhere near like the picture material is thin but not to bad
3.0,"It was too long for me but very pretty, a little short on the material that covers the skin at the bottom."
3.0,Nice boot if buy it again will get a size bigger little too narrow
3.0,"I loved the packaging and the quality of the plug.  It was a very soft, flexible, silicon with just the right amount of rigidity.  However I wore for 12 hours under my waist trainer and it irritated my navel and formed a blister and redness around the edges.  I’m guessing I’m allergic to the material it’s made of but I do love the shape it gave my belly button.  Guess I’ll have to try another kind."
3.0,"When I got the watch, I took it out of the package and immediately one of the gems fell off the face. The battery was dying, but seller at least included a new one... problem was replacing the old battery, which caused me to dislocate the band and took a while to get it back into place. Worries me that it means band will easily dislocated in future and next time I'll lose pin..."
3.0,The middle stone/decoration moves TOO much!☹️
3.0,I truly love these overalls but one button fell off right out of the package & the rest were loose. So sewed & reinforced all of the buttons. The pants are very comfortable. ..
3.0,Shirt seems low-quality. Pants seem ok-quality. Overall way too large.
3.0,"Great watch design and overall good but the bad does wear pretty quickly and have had to purchase another watch, though you could change out the band for extended use."
3.0,"The band itself is really very pretty, and definitely makes a smartwatch look less utilitarian. The closure, though, is simply awful. Admittedly, it's easy to get off and on, but the giant cord lock thing digs into my wrist if I put my arm down flat on my desk, and the chains are so long that they dangle into everything, wrap around the cord lock, and get tangled together. The only way this is a good option for a closure is if you never wear long sleeves, and walk slowly everywhere you go with your arm parallel to the floor. For those of us who have work to do, having 2.5 inch long chains hanging in our food, getting soap on them when we wash our hands, and getting tangled around the lock and the band...just doesn't work. I have two of these, and I'll keep them, but won't wear them until I figure out a better solution for the clasp."
3.0,This is thin but very cute - I didn't expect much but figured it would last a season or two. Unfortunately it's annoying as the arms will NOT stay tied and seem to come undone constantly. It's a shame as it's very cute - fabric is thin and overall this isn't well made so don't expect much and you won't be let down.
3.0,I like this one alot. It is hard to put in but pretty when you get it in. It turned me green but I'd still wear it for a night but I wouldn't keep it in for too long before I go green.
3.0,"Super cute! Top fits perfect on me, but the bottoms are sooo tiny!!"
3.0,Great design but way to small!
3.0,The dress part of this item is very cute however the straps that hook in the back they're very very cheap and thin and they come off very easily so I guess if you're out in public somewhere in one of the straps come off you're going to be embarrassed
3.0,"Super cute, but they started to rust, magnets broke off, and charms changed color. If you buy them, keep them away from water."
3.0,"really short... go up a size. nice loose fit, but too short to be a dress... even on my skankiest day"
3.0,I took the measurements in accordance with the instructions the dress when it arrived was too small. I will have to return it.
3.0,"Cute boots, but poor quality."
3.0,"I had higher hopes I think when I read the great reviews.<br /><br />I’m 5’6 and 115 lbs. I got a small which is my usually size.<br /><br />The skirt comes to about the top of my knee. It is a bit on the short side, but I don’t mind that.<br /><br />My big issue with it is the band in the middle. Idk If it’s supposed to come to the waist, my guess is yes but it falls just under my boobs. This makes the dress look really weird. Like that band should be lower down. Again don’t know if that’s the cut or if it’s too small, but either way it looks funny.<br /><br />The actual dress itself fits me perfectly. I’d say if you’re my height and over 120 a medium would be better. I don’t know if a medium would bring the band down more or not, but I’m going to wear a sweater with it to hide it and that will work. I don’t feel like sending it back because I’m not 100% sure it will even fix it and a medium might be too big in the chest.<br /><br />The material is kind of weird too. Like a polyester type fabric that’s a bit scratchy to me.<br /><br />In all it’s okay. Just was expecting more from all the great reviews."
3.0,"The fabric is very thin and lightweight. However, they have ZERO stretch as the ad states. I do like the size of them because they are much larger than the majority of the head scarves I have purchased."
3.0,I did not care for this product. It was difficult to insert and probably more importantly; did not sit properly on nose.
3.0,Vest looks great. Couple buttons on the inside arrived broken but the rest of the vest looks great.
3.0,The pants were very small in the waist and hips. I held them up out of the package and they looked no bigger than a medium. I tried stretching the waist band but it had very limited give. I ordered a 3x and like my clothing larger.  The cloth was thin.
3.0,Good looking. But too big. From nose to chin. Made for a huge man's size face I'm thinking. Wldnt buy again due to this.
3.0,Nice watch for the money. Band and watch thinner than expected .
3.0,"Really cool looking rings, but they turned after about a month - but enjoyed them while they lasted."
3.0,"I am normally an xs/s , I ordered the small not measuring myself beforehand (my fault). WAY to small. Would not even fit around my 5 yr old. Measured myself and ordered the medium. Can fit on the very last snap but cant breath, have now ordered the large and extra large it hopes that one of them fit as I need it for a specific event. Very cute and good quality. I'd suggest you measure yourself and go up a size from that because the measurements in the description are completely wrong."
3.0,seems cheap not sure how long it will last. Looks okay
3.0,"My son loved the costume. It was comfortable (he is 5'11"" and skinny scrawny) and roomy for him. But OMG, it had as many layers as an onion. By the time the night ended, he had wrestled with readjusting it so much that he just left many of the pieces in the car."
3.0,Had difficulty putting these together. Not worth the hassle. I’ll only buy them already made up in the future.
3.0,I really wish you can mix and match the bottoms with the top. I got a medium and the bottoms are great but my boobs are spilling out of the cups. I?'m a 32ddd
3.0,"Beautiful design, extremely large"
3.0,"I’m 5’2, these got a little baggy and saggy after a few hours."
3.0,"The look was good, but the sizing is not. The equivalent to US XL is more like a M-L at best. The zipper is also on left side."
3.0,My daughter wanted some glasses for dress up.
3.0,I like the pattern; the stripes match up. What I didn't like was the chemical smell of the dye or the fabric. It took many washings to get ride of the smell.
3.0,"I don’t like the material at all, it’s weird I can’t explain it but it gets the job done."
3.0,It looks much more tailored In the photos. It’s okay quality the cut is meh at best
3.0,They are food.quilaty gym shorts just a little bulky. My husband didn't seem.to.mind though
3.0,It's great vest with high quality threads. but the warming fibers in side wear out after about 20 usages. Only 30 day warranty against heating element :(
3.0,CALF AREA IS TOO TIGHT!!
3.0,"The finish isn't as shiny as the photo. Other than that, it's ok."
3.0,Watch the jump rings..this one keeps falling off.
3.0,Great for looks. Not so good at performance. Will absorb any type of liquid or moisture. Stretches out quickly and not the easiest to clean. Good for a handful of uses. Not designed for long term use
3.0,These were about a size too small and yet they were waaaaay too long!
3.0,They have the look I want but they are difficult to put in and do not stay in place.
3.0,Love it ..its for my thumb
3.0,It is tight. It is also very hard to see the sheep or realize what animal it is because part of the design remains gathered around your neck.
3.0,The stitching ripped but still looks okay when I wear it.
3.0,will not wear well but looks good now
3.0,"Looks cute, but it is quite small...even for my 30 lb three-year-old. She also doesn't like that it is scratchy."
3.0,"My son is 8 and they don’t fit. Too small, not adjustable. Will hang on to them for my younger child in the future. Can’t comment on how they function as I cannot currently use them"
3.0,They were too long. I should have gotten the petite.other wise they fit
3.0,"Nice material. The photo makes the dress look like the straps are thin and that the neck line hangs low. They are actually thick straps and the neckline is closer to the neck. Which is fine I just wish it was closer to the pic. I also ordered the reddish, pink one."
3.0,to tight In the nose area
3.0,"These Capri leggings have a thick fleece lining that isn’t suitable for summer. They are well made though, and look good."
3.0,"Got this to try to stay warm at home during the cold winter in Ohio. I receive a gray one, and it looks nice in the beginning. After wearing it for a few hours, I have decided to return it for two reasons.<br />1. The material doesn't feel very comfortable.<br />2. It keeps touching my chin, which makes me annoyed. (maybe I have a short neck?)<br />The product description shows it has ""soft material."" I doubt this claim is true. Perhaps everyone has a different definition of ""soft."""
3.0,"I liked the idea of this band,  the steel mesh feels soft in your fingers and the magnetic latch feels reasonably secure but what I hadn't anticipated was the interactions between the steel mesh and the hair on my wrist which repeatedly got pinched and pulled."
3.0,"This bracelet is ok for the price, my grandaughter I am sure will love it."
3.0,"I waited a long time for this sweat shirt, first it's not sweat shirt material. Looks like shiny polyester,  and it can small, size chart not correct. Very disappointed!"
3.0,Not as good as another pair that ordered.  These seems to be more flimsy and the lens almost pops out.
3.0,The glasses were fine but the wire that surrounds your head was so hard that if you rested ur head on anything soft the glasses would push off your nose.
3.0,its so cute but its super super small. if you want it for school dont get this!!
3.0,"Nice dress for the price,however the length was shorter than expected."
3.0,Thin sock doesn't show with shoes however they are constantly slipping off of my feet at the heel.
3.0,"Really liked the watch, but I could not wear it as, the band is too small for my wrist. I have an 8 1/2 inch wrist and the band is not expandable at all. Tried to contact the manufacturer but, there is no way to email or call them for additional links.<br />If you have an 8 inch or larger wrist and are not willing to replace the band, you should avoid this watch."
3.0,Length is wonderful but it is tight on the chest. When on is slightly see through on chest. Colors not like orig pac man.
3.0,"Bought medium but uncomfortably tight and I have small hands.  Will return.  Otherwise, a nice product."
3.0,"Very pretty , but way bigger than I had expected"
3.0,"This is a good no-frills belt for the price charged.  However belt length and easy-to-lose belt loop decreased my rating.  The belt came with a hole punch in case you need to add another hole to shorten the belt.  (The hole punch makes a round hole whereas the other pre-existing holes on the belt are oval shaped.  This different hole shape will be unnoticeable since the buckle hides the hole.) Note, the belt size does run large.  I wear a size 6/8 and ordered size Small due to the other reviews.  At its shortest, the belt measured 33 inches and was loose on my natural waist!  This size worked ok for pants that ride on the hips but I will probably punch another hole to make the belt shorter for those pants that sit on my natural waist.  There are 2 belt loops on the belt.  One is secured and stays next to the buckle.  The 2nd belt loop is loose and &#34;float&#34; around the belt.  It can easily come off when you hang it on a hook.  It would be much better if the loop wrapped around the belt tighter so it does not fall off.  Lastly, this belt is only 3/4&#34; thick so it may be too thin for jeans.  It would work better for dress pants."
3.0,La talla es pequeña para ser para adulto.
3.0,"Love the design, but the fit is a bit off."
3.0,Seems like a good product but it is very thin and it is much smaller than a normal size XL.  It is skin tight on me so be aware.  I would probably need a 2x in this shirt to even consider the possibility of wearing it.
3.0,Watch is pretty but did not receive tool for resizing.
3.0,"nice dress. nice style. I'm 5'6"" 138lbs. the L was too skin tight.  I ordered the XL its much better"
3.0,"Awesome idea, great gift. Looks good. My girlfriend loves it. After about 3 months it broke when trying to tighten it."
3.0,"Very thin, shiny material. Was hoping for a more &#34;quality feel&#34; and fabric instead of cheap, thin silk."
3.0,"I never wore it, i wasnt that thrilled"
3.0,Style was as shown...I will wear them...but won't love wearing them...too bad
3.0,"It's pretty, I would use it on a different necklace, the stone is really nice, not sure about the bird?"
3.0,"It's cute but, the cuff didn't work with my daughter's cartilage piercing. Her piercing is angled & the cuff didn't reach the back part of her ear so only the front is attached. She still sports it."
3.0,Not what I expected. Video shows how easy to put on but you’ll need some effort to get it on.
3.0,"This hat runs too small if your child has a ""big"" head;  it does not fit my 6 yr. old boy (he has a big head).  The black ribbon started to come off within one day of play/wear."
3.0,A solid and well shaped key chain; it can become a nice gift for a friend who believes in the Zodiac.
3.0,Feels like a big diaper. Lol
3.0,"It's actually a very nice band, and fits the Movado watch well.  The only problem, the Movado watch I own is Gold, the photo on Amazon shows a Gold clasp, and the band received comes with a silver color clasp.  There is an over sized Gold clasp included, but it's much larger than the proper sized silver clasp.  Also no instructions on how to remove the silver clasp....cut if off I guess, if you want to change to gold.  I wouldn't use the gold clasp as it way to wide for the band.  I'd just like to receive a band that looks like the photo."
3.0,A little heavier than expected
3.0,"I like the bag it is a strongly built bag,  but I'm just a little disappointed that I had to put an organizer in it to get it to stand as shown in the photo and the opening could have been made to open a little wider."
3.0,"This was cute, looked exactly like the picture, I returned it because I carry my weight in the middle and this was not for me. I am 5'3 190 lbs 36DD"
3.0,Size is way too small.. make sure you get at least a size bigger.
3.0,"The watch looks great. You can see the face and hands great at night. Sturdy metal band . The main issue that will keep me from buying this again is the clasp.  It seems to come apart at any time if your active , wear long sleeves or wearing a jacket. There is a metal part on each side where you squeeze both together the watch will come loose. If one side gets pushed in it will come a part. A real aggravation that will stop me from buying this watch again."
3.0,Very heavy boot. Too heavy for me.
3.0,"I ordered a size medium. I am 5'4 115lbs, size 25 waist, 34 C chest and the bottoms fit perfectly but the top is way too small. Good quality, well made but the sizing is meant for a tiny person up top and bottom."
3.0,Ehhh for the price they are good. THEY ARE NOT POLORIZED.
3.0,Not what I expected<br />Extremely thin and the size suggested was way to small I’m a 6 or 8 size medium<br />I looked like I had on scuba gear
3.0,"I'm a 5'9 male with a somewhat athletic build. I wear 32x30 jeans and these joggers in medium fit pretty well. The waist is perfect. However, these tend to ride up my crotch a bit. Nothing terrible but I do have to adjust it from time to time when I'm sitting down.<br /><br />The material is super light and not ideal AT ALL for cold temperatures. I can feel the slightest breeze through the thin material. Not bad if you're wearing them on a run or at the gym. I'd say they're great summer joggers.<br /><br />The pockets are big but they don't flare out and make you look wider. However, things will fall out of them especially if you're sitting down.<br /><br />As far as quality... Not the best but for $20 you'll get your money's worth. I've already worn them a dozen times during workouts and they've held up. However, I don't expect these to last me years. Again, I only paid $20 for these so I'm not expecting these to last for a long time.<br /><br />My fiance loves how these look on me. Pretty stylish."
3.0,"I want to love this sooooo badly. Unfortunately I have purchased two and both broke within a few weeks of having them. One had a crack down it, splitting it in two right after purchasing it. I bought a replacement and the top hook part slipped right out of the rock, which shattered everywhere. It's a really beautiful piece, just wish they didn't break so easily. Also, my first was was double the size of the second one."
3.0,"Fun design!  Great price.  I ordered a size bigger, it shrunk a little bit after washing."
3.0,it's very see through and too tight in the top for me. It's.a sheer dress that should be worn with a cami and slip for most but I love the print sorry it does not fit thee. I have to return it. Batting zero this month . The dress fits well just tight in bust area.
3.0,"I weigh a strong but lean 125 pounds and 5 ft. 3, and this barely covers my butt. Depending on the look you are going for, you may need leggings or tights."
3.0,"Just like your silver metallic bag, this one is OFF by 0.5"" TOO! You really should post the measurements of the bag AFTER it's been assembled, not BEFORE! Otherwise, a very nice bag. But NOT 9x9"". It is actually 8.5x8.5"""
3.0,I wore this and I thought it looked great. If you are busty the shirt will definitely attract attention. Was cute for a casual wear. Didn’t like the material used they used to make this either. I live in Miami and I was hot during the entire time. Maybe a cold weather state with cool jacket would look great.
3.0,It's a great belt! It is a little wide for my daughter to put in the belt loops easily so it's a small struggle. Other than that it's really nice and she likes it
3.0,The dress is OK for the price.
3.0,This material let's out so much Ink It will stain even your hands.I recommend a good wash 2 or 3x before use.
3.0,Comfortable material but sizing is way way off. Needed to order a much larger size and even then smaller than I usually wear.
3.0,"these are a little big; they don't fit too well on the face and slip down easily due to the wood. if anyone has any suggestions on adhesives or methods of tightening the grip on the head, I'm hear for it"
3.0,"I liked the skirt but it's just too short on me. I'm around 5'7&#34; and 145 lbs. I carry most of my weight in my thighs and butt region so I usually get a medium in bottoms US. But I sized up cuz amazon clothing items typically run small in my experience. Unfortunately, this skirt is waaaaaay too short on me. Even if I returned it for the next size up I doubt it would make a difference. It wouldn't provide enough length and it would probably be too wide in the waist. I have a little bit of a butt and it only comes down just below it. It sits nice at my waist but that's about it. If you look at the pictures girls have posted, most of them are narrow in the hip area and noticeably shorter. So if you're hipp-ier or have a little bit of a butt and on the tall side, you should pass on this skirt and search elsewhere.<br /><br />I was really hoping it would look good. Oh well! It's a hit or miss with these things. Better luck with the next find :)"
3.0,Size up! These are also rather short and thin.
3.0,"The fit is good, The stitching is not. There are holes in both pockets and a few loose seams. I sew so it will be easy for me to fix. Just an FYI."
3.0,"Aesthetically this is a wonderful looking jacket and my daughter LOVES it.<br />BUT this jacket is very, very thin. It doesn’t keep her warm and it’s a bit of a bummer. She doesn’t actually get to wear it as much as she’d like because it doesn’t keep her warm."
3.0,"I like the concept, but these will ruin your shoes with stench! So stinky!"
3.0,The shorting of pieces in orders. Im gonna goto EBay.
3.0,Runs large. Quality suspect.
3.0,A little disappointed the closure had turned black overnight after wearing it just one time
3.0,The patterns does not match in the front and back. Not for hippy girls. If you size up the top will be way too big. Comes from China expect a two week wait.
3.0,SLIPPER STRETCHES OUT AFTER A DAY
3.0,"They fit true to size and well, the colors were great with one exception. Where it appears in the photo to have love outlined in black it is not. It is the same color as the entire ring. It's hardly noticeable really!"
3.0,It's cute but I felt like the fabric made it look like it came from a 2nd hand store (the bottoms looked worn).  I decided NOT to gift it to my niece but put it in the Salvation Army donation bin.
3.0,"Looks ok, but fits good"
3.0,Super soft and warm but it sheds A LOT
3.0,5'4&#34; / 145 lbs. I wanted to love this dress but it was a bit too snug. I didn't try a larger size but maybe should have. It's got a great hemline and very nice beadwork. Would look good on someone curvy but maybe try order two sizes and choosing the best fit for you.
3.0,These don’t adequately cover mouth and nose. It slips down when talking it is also very hot on my face compared to other masks
3.0,"I was expecting for the openings to be bigger. I had to toggle with it to get it onto a thin snake chain. One of the 3 is noticeably smaller than the other two and a slightly different color. Otherwise these are great, and it looks good on a chain (very difficult to get it on there though)"
3.0,Love the shirt besides the cut at the bottom is to short.<br />Consider using classic tee's so us girthy A-holes aren't flopping Chungus out there ourselves.<br /><br />Thanks
3.0,It doesn’t fit as I expected. It isn’t very long but is very soft
3.0,"They were just ok. They seemed to be made well, But I ended up returning them. I normally fit just fine in a 2xl and thought they were way too tight."
3.0,The bands were much more bulky than I hoped for.
3.0,"These run big. I had to return it for a smaller size. They are very soft and the graphic is really pretty but it’s just a T-shirt and I don’t think I’d spend $28 for something like this again, especially when Sam’s club had them for under $20."
3.0,"The dress is pretty, but the material is thicker than I thought and a little heavy. I think the dress would be even better with a different material."
3.0,"I was so sad to have to return this. I'm large chested and the dress didn't suit my figure since it has buttons over the chest area (you know what I mean if your large). I have this issue a lot so I wouldn't say it's a flaw in the dress design.  So disappointed. It was beautiful, and a great value!"
3.0,Dress ran small and neckline in front is very high and uncomfortable. Otherwise- true to photos.
3.0,"Very cheap feeling. Awkawardly long, too small"
3.0,Really cute but this is definitely not for a normal size baby with a normal size head.....its huge
3.0,El tamaño no coincide con la talla indicada.
3.0,"Gloves received when said, however, thumb on right hand was not closed and sewn."
3.0,Paint/plastic chipped and faded. Doesn't feel new at all.
3.0,"Probably not suited for women with bigger calves than the size allows for - everything else, however, fits okay."
3.0,it change color after fiew days of werring it
3.0,"The Jacket's great and warm, but without 2 outside pockets"
3.0,It is good but not dry feeling when we're it .
3.0,beautiful bracelet. stones are lovely. i suppose if you had it completely done over by a jeweler it would look spectacular and cost about $2222.00
3.0,"These are nice looking sunglasses but if you're like me and have a narrow bridge on your nose, they will slide right off. I can't wear these."
3.0,"I was between sizes based on the chart, so I ordered up (like I usually do). The bras arrived promptly, but we're too big. I returned them and ordered the small. Again, they arrived promptly. Sadly, the bras are still too big even when adjusted to the smallest size! So if you are bigger busted with a smaller band size, these may not fit as hoped."
3.0,Cheaply made looks nice although
3.0,"This is a really cute shirt. I have two complaints, but decided to keep it for the price. The description says it comes with a headband, but it did not. It was also hard to tell that the heart on the front is printed on the shirt instead of it being a piece of fabric sewn on the shirt. It still looks ok though. After looking at the photos closer & knowing the heart is printed on, I can see a little bit of the gloss on the heart that shows it is printed. Again, without knowing that, it would be hard to tell."
3.0,"The shoes look great, however the material I feel is not going to last very long. Very thin and fake like leather material."
3.0,This is an XXL rather than an 2XL.
3.0,"It's super cute but definitely didn't fit.  The top was better than the bottoms.  I know that the super high cut bottoms are in right now, so it might not be a problem for some people.  It's definitely not my style, unfortunately, so I was bummed."
3.0,Worst back pocket location ever. Pocket is below the waist line in the middle of the shorts. Not left or right back side pocket-it’s in the middle! You can’t sit down if you have anything in that back pocket. Scary that someone thought this was a good idea and got others to go along with it.
3.0,Didn't work for me but I was diagnosed with sleep apnea after trying this and I am now on a CPAP machine.
3.0,"If you are an A or B cup this dress will probably work for you. If you’re anything larger, this dress is not for you. I wish it had more fabric around the armpit area because it creates the problem of cleavage popping out. The fabric is a good bandage material but you might need someone to help zip you up because the zipper is all the way down the dress and it’s awkward to get up yourself. That didn’t bother me too much though."
3.0,Came broken but was able to superglue it for my costume
3.0,Need to mold the wig with gel and hairspray to stay in place. The sunglasses and chain were surprisingly better quality than I expected.
3.0,"it is just not long enough, have to use extender again.  I was hoping the chain was 18 inches in length."
3.0,I like the style and fabric but somehow they are too tight for my boys.<br /><br />I recommend a size bigger than what you usually wear. My is M so I will buy a L size when I get the chance.
3.0,the frames look bigger in the picture than they are.
3.0,It's bulky when its empty!
3.0,"It's a very pretty chain, but it bends a little, and doesn't really have a shine to it, no weight to it really. But it's definitely worth what I paid for it."
3.0,"Material is great, dress is super cute, but dress is way too small. Wish I would have sized up TWO sizes from the size I normally buy my daughter."
3.0,My chief complaint about these booties is that the material of these boots is super stiff. It does not bend naturally with the bending of the foot while walking. Your socks will show through the cutouts on the side. Other than that I was able to wear these boots all day without too much discomfort. But I will not recommend these booties if you have to walk a great deal.
3.0,Length great. Not a normal 7. A. It more snug
3.0,"Love the colors. The XL was too big, the L would have been too small. I will wear it with all black."
3.0,It works ok use for bd in case lights go out but for the price it's ok
3.0,Kinda cheap looking on the metal parts up close and not as colorful as I hoped. I have small/ medium wrists and these are too big even tightened all the way up. I’ll probably wear them as anklets.
3.0,Super cute blouse but fit is def small. I’m a size 8/10 and usually wear a Medium. Bought this in an XL and it fit perfectly. Cute shirt.
3.0,"Was hoping it was more of a burnt orange like the photo,but it's very bright RED..which is fine, but it has red dots all over the white writing..the material is good, and fits exactly as a U.S size should,if you order up a size or two!"
3.0,It’s pretty large and very long. I’m 5’5 and will probably need to tie it up. But it’s comfy!
3.0,MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,Go up a size or two.
3.0,They are just fair
3.0,Lots of stretch; the size chart seems to assume that you want to wear them like pants instead of tights or leggings.
3.0,It’s fine - you get what you pay for but there is no tags in it and it’s kinda see through
3.0,"Love this thing. Very sturdy and easy to open and close. It’s heavy, though, which is why I only gave it three stars on weight. The other issue is that it's not easy to carry---the second time I used it, the strap came out and now I can't loop it around my wrist any more. On most umbrellas you can just thread a shoelace or something through the two holes, but on this, there was only one hole, and the strap was held in place by some kind of clip inside the handle  that broke and can't be fiddled with easily. So now I have to put it into my purse or backpack, or carry it with my hand around it, which is kind of a pain. But for Boston rains, which happen all year round and are often accompanied by high winds, I expect this to work well for me this winter!"
3.0,"While I loved all three pairs and they were as pretty as pictured, the tiger's eye were two different sizes.  Both far larger than 4g.  The flares on the smokey quartz were rather too large as well, but I can put them in with some effort.  The opalite pair though fit perfectly.  I get lots of compliments on them."
3.0,I am replacing the straps on these because they were sharp and cut into my skin. Not very well made. Cheap but you get what you pay for. Not enough coverage. When I bend over frontwards I am in danger of falling out!
3.0,the coat is okay do not like the collar
3.0,they are ok  for young girls
3.0,The stones are bigger than what they appear in the picture.  It is still pretty but would be better if the stones were smaller
3.0,The dress is not true to size.
3.0,Don't like the way it fits
3.0,Cute print but the cut in the neckline is weird.
3.0,"The glasses work very well for daytime and I have not driven at night with the other pair. They are very cheaply made and will in time, I think, break. I will then buy some more as they were not expensive."
3.0,it doesn't sit still it moves around
3.0,"I really liked this product at the beginning.  Loved that it held my keys in place, so you don’t get that key-jingling sound.  However, it didn’t even last me a month, which makes me really sad!  The screw part of keyring that secures your keys together started coming loose.  To test it out, I pulled the keys apart, and sure enough, the screw came out.  Maybe I might’ve overdone it, and wore out the treads on the screw.  Not sure..<br /><br />Overall, great concept, just weak execution."
3.0,The band is very stiff and the watch is EXTREMELY loud. It sounds like a wall clock. Other than that it is as described and shipping was quick.
3.0,wish it fit better
3.0,It’s nice quality but the wrong one was shipped
3.0,"Certainly one of the more useful purchases I've made. The product really can't go wrong - It's just pieces of metal cut to shape. My biggest complaint however, was that the box came cracked, and all of the collar stays were covered in some machine oil. It took the better part of an hour to wash it out, but after that, the collar stays were a great purchase.<br /><br />Good product, but I can't give 5 stars on account of the grease."
3.0,It broke in 5 days.
3.0,Like it for the first few months then it started fraying and has weird armpit stains from deodorant.
3.0,Very cute but fits somewhat small. Only worn once because I was uncomfortable.
3.0,They stretch funny.
3.0,"Cute, cheap earrings - but 4 of the earrings fell apart before I even wore them:( Very cheaply made but at that price - you can’t really complain that much. But, I was disappointed in the quality."
3.0,Very cute but NOT TTS. I would say 2 sizes larger then they are suppose to be.
3.0,"This sweater is soft, but it does not really look all that good.  More specifically, it looks kind of baggy.  We have seen the waffle pattern executed well, but in our opinion, the execution of the waffle pattern in this case was not executed all that well.  As a possible layer over other clothes, it is kind of okay, but hardly a fashion statement, in our opinion.<br /><br />As for value, based primarily on price, the value seems above average.  However, our traditional assessment of value is based at least partially on desirability of an item.  In the case of this pullover, we consider the desirability to be relatively low.  Accordingly, we believe we need to reassess the value from above average to something lower.  However, we did not want to be excessively biased against this pullover, so we decided to consider the value as about average.<br /><br />Our rating for this pullover is three stars.  While the price of this pullover is affordable, this pullover is, in our opinion, hardly stylish.  It is a bit on the baggy side, which means that it sags to the point of exposing things that be better left unexposed.  Sometimes, clothing designs just do not work out, and this pullover appears to be one of those.<br /><br />Good luck!"
3.0,Product description did not give measurement  for fit of width of palm/length/fingers. My 3 1/4&#34; palm width just about fit; fingers felt cramped.. Gloves would be better with a bit of spandex for comfort or sizing small-medium-large-Xlarge.I would like the same gloves but with open fingertops and navy blue to replace the black (not a hot weather color). Hand wash & air dry these gloves!  My old elastic crocheted open fingertip gloves wore out a couple of years ago - replacements not easy to find.
3.0,The color was tan not army green
3.0,It works well for keeping track of basic needs such as taking my pills and telling me the time. It is limited on what it can do but my needs are limited to those things so the rest is irrelevant to me.<br /><br />The hour/minute hands do glow to an extent in the dark but the numbers do not. The numbers are large and easy to read. We have two atomic wall clocks in our house and I absolutely love them. I can count on consistent time accuracy.<br /><br />The band is not comfortable. I would prefer to have an elastic band without the need to latch it in the back. While the band is a nice leather it's also very difficult to latch and I don't have the strength in my hands needed to pull it tighter to the next hole down. An elasticized cloth type band that could just be pulled on and off would be a better option. I suspect that maybe other senior women would find that much easier too. Personally I'm going  for function and not making a fashion statement.<br /><br />I found that even though it's advertised as unisex it'a bit too big for my wrist and rather bulky. It's really more of a man's watch given the size of the clock itself. It's almost three times the physical size of my current watch. I realize that it has quite a few extras on it that probably require the increase in size to accommodate the mechanicals that support all the features. The most appreciated features are the alarm setting to remind me to take my pills AND being able to push a button and have it tell me the time and date. No more squinting. It's definitely on the right track to hitting its targeted market.
3.0,"The mask seems to be good quality, but it small for my head and is uncomfortable, especially on the ears."
3.0,This is a great shirt.  My only issue is that the black bleeds.  Just wash it separately from anything else lighter.  I have washed it prob 4-5 times now and it is still bleeding.
3.0,"Not really what I wanted, but they mostly work for what I needed."
3.0,They were really cute just run so small. I just wish could have fit then
3.0,"not the best quality, the connector to the watch is wiggly, it won't fall out but also not is nice and snug"
3.0,"This came broken, but a twist and a pinch from my glasses tools fixed it right up."
3.0,"I like this dress, but there was a rip on the side. I was able t fix it, so it's not that big of a deal. Just annoying to buy a new dress with a hole in it. With that being said, I still really like it and I'm going to order another one!"
3.0,The back is a little strip of material so it makes my back look huge.
3.0,"As others state order the next size up...or 2. Im a small 12, ordered a 14 and they just fit (doesnt help that Im bloated). Very nice dark denim, great for casual Fridays. Heavy denim, however pretty baggy in the legs. Also these are not slim bootcut, I'd go as far as saying more flare than boot."
3.0,"I ordered a 2 gauge and they were too big, so I had to gauge up. They fit like a 2.5 gauge"
3.0,The design is pretty cool but my only problem is its too big (medium) but the small one I too small for me I'm somewhat in the middle of small a medium.
3.0,NICE NECKLACES FOR THE PRICE! IT KIND OF SNUGG THE NECK A LITTLE. I ONLY WORE IT TWICE AND ALREADY IT IS STARTING TO FADE. BUT OVERALL ALL I LIKE! JUST WHICH IT DIDNT TURN SO FAST
3.0,Gave to my neighbor because were too small
3.0,Stitching is bad but still wearable.
3.0,"It's a really cute necklace. The charm is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but otherwise, very cute!"
3.0,These earrings make a great stament and I would have given it 5 stars but they broke before I even got to wear them.  I did hot glue them and so far they are ok.
3.0,"The size was accurate but the fit is all wrong, very short waist…not flattering at all."
3.0,"It's a nice fleece, just the &#34;foliage green&#34; gets me everytime with the colors and the picture. A lot lighter color then expected, a lot like the Army's useless camo color, this must be the army's undergarment or something, had one similar in desert marpat in the USMC."
3.0,"it looks very nice on my 2 1/2 years old boy, but he does not like to wear it (as I think if might not be very comfortable), especially the buckle might be rubbing the ankle bone."
3.0,After a washing they fit smaller than when I bought them.
3.0,"Thin ,  very very light weight"
3.0,I was excited to get the package. This is my first purchase since getting my piercing. Unfortunately the posts were too short for me. Guess I have fat lips. I didn't know what my size would be before ordering. I gave them to a friend. Don't know if he's tried them yet or not.
3.0,"I wasn't expecting much for how much this top cost, but I like it pretty well. Despite reading some reviews about the need to size up, I ordered my usual medium and am happy I did (for reference I am 5'5&#34;, 135 lbs.). This top is very soft and looks good with leggings (per the LeggingsQueen's design, no doubt). I have &#34;child bearing hips&#34; and while I think this would generally look better on someone with narrow hips like the model, I adjusted the ruching to fit my shape - if you pull it all the way down it loses its shape and is pretty long. It felt like wearing pajamas which I am not against, and this would also work with jeans. The dolman sleeves are not overly batwing-ish in my opinion."
3.0,Cute but short!
3.0,My 3 year old loves it. The screen print looks cheap but he’s happy with it.
3.0,The arrived and fit a bit small.
3.0,"Small frame, does not fit over my glasses"
3.0,The gummy bears I got were not the ones pictured. I don’t know why they wouldn’t just use pictures of their actual products.. but the colors were totally different and the shape is a different mold too
3.0,Looks cute under tops. No support in case anyone was wondering. I think it's worth the price.
3.0,"I ordered a small. The legging material is soo nice! Not sheer, and very stretchy. They make your butt look good but omg the front. It defines my v- in such an awkward way. There are much better leggings out there that won’t define that area as much."
3.0,It looks cute but the fit is not to my liking.
3.0,We thought it was what wed
3.0,IT IS OKAY!!
3.0,It says to order a size smaller so I did and they are still HUGE. Was planning to wear them to a ren fest in two days as they were supposed to complete the outfit.
3.0,"The second hand stopped working properly after I dropped one; fine for telling time, not so good for my work needs."
3.0,The leggings fit great except for the top waistband. So i just cut it off and sewed the fabric over
3.0,"This dress arrived quickly and was really cute and flattering on. I like the fabric, but there were lots of little threads that needed to be trimmed, the top button popped of when I tried it on and it was sewn with one puff sleeve smaller than the other. The smaller sleeve dug into my arm any time I tried to lift it. I need to be able to lift my arms."
3.0,Would like to get information to return for a smaller size.
3.0,"Thin, baggy and slouchy. It's good for chilling out."
3.0,It's so freaking cute.  I ordered a large hopping it would be long enough.  Because a lot of shirts are too short when you're 5'8. Unfortunately this one is too short and I haven't even washed it yet.  I love everything else about it.  If you're shorter you'll love it or even if you like a little tummy showing.
3.0,The color  was not as bright and the length was longer than expected.  I had it shortened 6 inches
3.0,Dropped it once and it shattered. Otherwise very pretty.
3.0,Very pretty but the chain broke already...
3.0,Good made and very nice
3.0,"Label in the shirt says it’s a 3T when the listing said 2T-3T. Cute shirt, too big for my daughter right now."
3.0,Very cute but would have liked a regular pin back on it.
3.0,Difficult to get on.  The edges are kind of rough when trying to put onto my wrist and I have very small wrists.
3.0,"The material is meant to be wrinkled...I think. I’m 4’11 about 185 mom pouch lol 38d, the dress didn’t stay off my shoulders. Still looked cute but frumpy, I looked pregnant and when i pulled it back a little you could see all my belly bumps 🤦🏻‍♀️  Just ordered a med in the lighter color. Finger crossed!"
3.0,"I have another one exactly like this and I love it, so maybe I just didn't read the description carefully enough. Well...to be honest, it was a gift from my husband, so he wouldn't know. But...I love the bag - I don't love the big fat divider that separates the two sides of the interior, kind-of defeats the whole tote purpose, in my mind.  It's a Tommy so the quality is great and if you like the divider you will love the bag."
3.0,"So, upon arrival like many other reviews you DO NOT get what's pictured. Its not black, its not brown. Dont know what color it is. Also, they are not distressed. Which i really wanted. They are smooth shiny leather. These are not meant for really cold icy weather. Too thin for that. With all that said they are a good hiking boot for most weather. Soft and comfortable. Im going on a hike tomorrow so maybe more later. I ordered the size I normally wear 8.5 and they will fit great with a medium sock. No tightness anywhere. No toe pinch. I do wish they were the blackish distressed as pictured. I'll really miss that. The pluses make it not worth returning as I live remotely and going to the pist office is not something I want to do just over color. Hope this all helps. Oh! These are no fashion statement. They are working/hiking boots."
3.0,Too narrow but classy
3.0,Pretty much just a pretty printed poncho with buttons... But I like it.
3.0,"The shirt was cute, really soft, and a bit heavy but not bad.  One thing I hoped it would be was bigger around my waist line. it fit fine but I bought a size up and it fit kinda snug for a sweatshirt.  I usually wear around a 3X but bought a 4X because I wanted it loose.  It fits but not to my liking, not with leggings for sure.  I'm use to shirts being slightly longer in the back to cover better. Overall it is a cute shirt, just wanted it looser for my comfort."
3.0,They are very comfortable for a few hours. They start to hurt and it feels as if I were walking barefoot for miles afterwards.
3.0,"purchased for child, so I can't speak to the comfort or arch support really.  cute shoe!"
3.0,this is a really nice top but it's a little too heavy for my liking. I preferr a lightweight material  this is not lightweight at all;
3.0,"its a wonderful shirt dont get me wrong, but after 2 washes not only did it pill, but the graphic is breaking up"
3.0,"It's not a tight fit as it appears it should be. I ordered the silver/grey one and got a black one? Really weird but it's still pretty, just not what I wanted."
3.0,These look cute but fit very weird. The cut on them is actually a feeling of wearing them backwards. Especially around the waist and hip area. I'm small in that area and it still is a tug fit there.
3.0,"Second wash the threading around the shoulder completely came out and now hangs off my arm like a distressed top (without the cuteness).<br />I washed it in a laundry bag made for delicates..on the delicate cycle.<br />Obviously poorly made. I had to cut the seam off and just go with it, but now it is very loose on that side. It also does not hold shape very well.<br />I gave three stars because it is at least comfortable….just not sexy now that it is in threads on the shoulder area. Wish it would have held up for more than 2 washes."
3.0,"fit well, the material is just to thin and unforgiving. if I had a perfect tight body, I would love it."
3.0,No nose wire to keep up.
3.0,Let's some wind in but stylish and comfy
3.0,"You did not.  I love the bag.  However the long strap which I wanted , end clasps are very cheaply made.  Have bent several times.  My husband rebent them closed only to have them open again.  At this time can not use the strap.  Very disappointed."
3.0,Fabric a bit heavier than I thought
3.0,"It is very comfortable but it does bunch up around your tummy.  If you do not have a flat stomach, like me, you will be yanking on it all day long.  That part is annoying.  I do like that is is comfy and goes with everything.  Buying a bigger size that what you wear won't solve the tummy bunching issue.  Just the type of fabric and cut this is."
3.0,Non-slip coating on arms frayed after relatively little use.
3.0,Not exactly happy about it!
3.0,This is a very delicate but beautiful bracelet. The only problem is that it seems to be made for a child's wrist. It was so small that I couldn't even get it clasped.
3.0,"unless there is just the right amount to put in this, it may not fit well.  used on one shoot so far, fail.  will be trying it at least twice more but already seeing other uses."
3.0,Not what I expected. It isn't really a sunglasses cleaning case like the standard material that comes when you buy an expensive pair but it gets the job done
3.0,Worked well but ran small
3.0,"The jacket arrives vacuum packaged in a small envelope, which is handy for shipment, but the jacket was very wrinkled when we took it out of the package. The material is quite thin and probably is more of a wind breaker than a heavier jacket. For the price, I thought it was a little high based on the quality. We ended up getting a size 14 jacket. Our son, 13, is in the picture wearing the jacket. It barely fits him so I would recommend going up a size. In our case, we are going to give it to our nephew instead since he is a couple years younger. The other thing that is weird that there are no tags on it so it looks strange if you are trying to give this as a gift.  However, the styling is cool and we think our nephew will like it."
3.0,Don’t really like anything. Material is cheap and shirt is uncomfortable. Bottom of shirt is straight across and stops just below waist. The design on shirt is ugly but in picture is very nice. Wish I had not wasted my miney
3.0,"This dress is fun and flowy but when I tried it on it was way too long for me. Also, in pictures it looked embroidered but it's actually just a print."
3.0,Cute outfit. Cheap fabric. My daughter won’t even wear it.
3.0,Very flimsy hard
3.0,"I ordered a size up, due to feedback left from other buyers. It is way too big :( I was out of town and missed the return window. Is there any way to return/exchange? it still has tags attatched."
3.0,"Its a little thin, but overall a good cheap pull over."
3.0,I liked the fit of the shirt (also bought in another color and love it) but the white is made with a very thin material and is very see through.  I missed the opportunity to return it but will never wear it.
3.0,"Super cute. Soft material. Since its a fitted style I ordered a size up, should of ordered 2 sizes up. I don't like anything super clingy though, but that's just me. Other than the fit, I have no complaints about the shirt itself."
3.0,Works fine in chilly weathers but I don't recommend to use for extremely cold conditions. Pictures fail to illustrate that the holes are only for four fingers and the thumb or for all individual fingers.
3.0,I like that this shoulder pad is in petite since it is not so big but it goes flat and I had problem with it staying in place. Still looking something better.
3.0,The dress is BEAUTIFUL  even if I only got to wear it once. After washing the dress the zipper didn't work anymore and has to be thrown out. If you are okay with possibly only wearing once I would recommend.
3.0,"Nice socks, quality and colors! I however like a tighter compression, they weren’t super tight compression like I’m used to."
3.0,"A bit bulky, but great to have on the mountain when snowboarding. Sound quality not the best, but gets the job done. Do recommend."
3.0,Kinda fits like a 1X not a 3X..so order up.
3.0,"It was a good price and for a Christmas party dress.  I haven't worn it yet but washed it to try and get some of the wrinkles out, but it says that you can't iron it so not sure how to get the wrinkles to disappear.  Also the seam across the neckline seems a bit frayed from washing.  It will be fine for one night."
3.0,"Overall it's OK for the price. The material could be a bit itchy. The pockets are a big plus.<br />Note it's not a cardigan to wear outside... it's too boxy. It's listed as 'Pajama Cardigan Sweater' but it's a Pajama / Robe, not a Cardigan or Sweater."
